Okay, let's see here. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair, with an explanation, and then the JSON at the end.

First, I'll look through the testimonies and see what each person is saying. The testimonies given here are Testimony 0 by Lotta Hart, which states: "I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!"

Now, looking at the evidences. Let's check Evidence 10: The murder weapon is a 22-caliber pistol fired three times, with Edgeworth's right hand prints. But wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 3) says the time of death was between 24th or 25th. Then there's Lotta's Camera (Evidence 2) which took a photo automatically at 12:15 AM on 12/25 (Evidence 4). The Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) is from 11:50 PM on 12/24, showing an empty lake. 

If Lotta's testimony says she saw Edgeworth on the boat, but the Second Lake Photo at 11:50 PM shows the lake empty, then maybe that contradicts her claim if the murder happened around midnight. Also, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM on 12/25 might show something different. Wait, but the Second Lake Photo is from 11:50 PM, just before midnight. If the murder was around midnight, maybe the photo at 11:50 shows no boat, but Lotta says she saw Edgeworth on the boat. But if the boat wasn't there at 11:50, how could she see him there after midnight? Hmm, but maybe the boat arrived after 11:50. However, the Lake Photo at 12:15 AM might show the boat. Wait, but the Lake Photo's details aren't specified. Alternatively, maybe the camera's position is important. The camera (Evidence 2) faces the lake and takes pictures when a loud noise is detected. Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two gunshots just after midnight. So the camera would have taken a photo then. But the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is taken at 12:15 AM. If the photo shows something conflicting with Lotta's testimony... But I need to check for contradictions.

Wait, Testimony 0 is Lotta saying she saw Edgeworth on the boat. If the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) taken at 11:50 PM shows the lake empty, and the murder happened around midnight (as per the gunshots heard just after midnight), then maybe the boat wasn't there at 11:50 PM, but the murder happened after. However, if the Lake Photo at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) shows the boat, that would align with Lotta's testimony. Alternatively, if the Second Lake Photo (11:50 PM) shows no boat, but Lotta claims to have seen Edgeworth on the boat after midnight, maybe there's a contradiction in timing. Wait, but the time of death is 24th or 25th. The gunshots were heard just after midnight on 12/25, so the murder was on the 25th. The 11:50 PM photo is on the 24th, so maybe that's not directly conflicting. Hmm.

Wait another angle: The murder weapon (Evidence 10) has Edgeworth's prints, but his testimony might say he didn't do it. But the testimonies given here are only Testimony 0 by Lotta. So maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let me check again. Testimony 0 is Lotta's claim that she saw Edgeworth on the boat. Now, if Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) is taken at 11:50 PM on 24th, showing an empty lake, but the murder happened after midnight on 25th, then maybe that's not a contradiction. However, if the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM shows the boat, but Lotta's testimony is about seeing Edgeworth on the boat at the time of the murder (which was around midnight), perhaps the camera's photo shows someone else or something conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the camera's photo doesn't show Edgeworth, contradicting Lotta's testimony.

Alternatively, maybe Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) taken at 11:50 PM on 24th shows the lake empty, and if the murder happened on the 25th just after midnight, then the boat might have appeared after 11:50. But Lotta's testimony is about seeing Edgeworth on the boat, so unless the photo at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) shows the boat without Edgeworth, but that's not specified. Wait, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is taken at 12:15 AM on 25th. If Lotta's testimony is about seeing Edgeworth at that time, but the photo shows no one there, then that would be a contradiction. But the description of Evidence 4 just says "Taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Click here for details." The details might show the boat but not Edgeworth, which would contradict Lotta's testimony. However, without the details, we have to assume based on given info. Alternatively, maybe the camera was facing the lake, and if the murder happened in a boat on the lake, the photo would capture that. But if the photo (Evidence 4) shows no boat when it should, that contradicts. But the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) taken at 11:50 PM on 24th shows empty, and then 12:15 AM on 25th (Evidence 4) would show the boat if it's there. So if Lotta's testimony is that she saw Edgeworth on the boat, but the photo shows no boat, that's a contradiction. But the problem is we don't know what Evidence 4 shows. However, the user provided all the evidence descriptions. Wait, Evidence 4 is called Lake Photo, and Evidence 16 is Second Lake Photo. Evidence 16 says "Shows an empty lake. Taken automatically on 12/24 at 11:50 PM." So the Second Lake Photo is empty. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM on 12/25â€”if that also shows an empty lake, then Lotta's testimony that she saw Edgeworth on the boat would contradict. But the description of Evidence 4 doesn't state that. Wait, Evidence 4's description is "Taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Click here for details." So maybe clicking details would show something, but in the given data, we don't have that. So perhaps the contradiction is between Lotta's Testimony 0 (saw Edgeworth on boat) and Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo at 11:50 PM on 24th showing empty). But if the murder was on the 25th, then maybe the boat wasn't there at 11:50 PM on 24th. However, the murder's time is 24th or 25th (Evidence 3). So maybe the actual death occurred on the 24th, but the gunshots were heard on the 25th. Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 3) says time of death is 24th or 25th. The gunshots heard just after midnight (Testimony 11) on 12/25. So the murder happened on the 25th. Therefore, the Second Lake Photo (11:50 PM on 24th) showing empty lake isn't directly conflicting. But the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM on 25th would be after the gunshots. If that photo shows the boat with Edgeworth, then it's consistent. But the user hasn't given details of Evidence 4's content. So perhaps another angle.

Looking at Evidence 10: Pistol has Edgeworth's prints. If Edgeworth's prints are on the murder weapon, but Testimony 0 says Lotta saw him on the boat, which might be the crime scene. But that's not a contradiction. Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (Lotta saw Edgeworth on the boat) and Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo showing empty lake at 11:50 PM). But if the murder happened after midnight, then the boat could have been there after 11:50 PM. Unless there's a time discrepancy. Alternatively, maybe the photo from Lotta's camera (Evidence 2) set to take pictures when a loud noise is detected. So when the gunshots happened (just after midnight), the camera took a photo, which is Evidence 4. If that photo doesn't show Edgeworth on the boat, then it contradicts Lotta's testimony. But since we don't have the photo's content details, maybe the timings are the key.

Alternatively, considering that the murder weapon (Evidence 10) was fired three times, but the autopsy report says death was caused by one bullet. But Evidence 9 says the bullet in the victim's body matches the murder weapon's barrel. That seems consistent. So no contradiction there.

Another possibility: Lotta's testimony says she saw Edgeworth on the boat, but the DL-6 Incident involved Gregory Edgeworth's death, and maybe there's a connection. But I'm not sure how that would directly contradict.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (Lotta saw Edgeworth on the boat) and Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo showing empty lake at 11:50 PM on 24th). If the murder happened just after midnight on the 25th, and the boat wasn't there at 11:50 PM, but Lotta claims to have seen Edgeworth on the boat during the time of the murder (after midnight), then maybe the boat arrived after 11:50 PM, so there's no contradiction. Unless the photo at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) shows something conflicting. But without knowing what's in Evidence 4, maybe the problem is that Lotta's camera took a photo at the time of the gunshot (12:15 AM) which would be Evidence 4. If that photo doesn't show Edgeworth on the boat, then it contradicts her testimony. But since we don't have the photo's details, we can't be certain. Alternatively, the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) shows the lake empty at 11:50 PM, but if the murder was at midnight, maybe the boat arrived after that. But Lotta's testimony is about seeing Edgeworth on the boat during the murder, which would be after 11:50 PM. So unless the photo taken at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) contradicts her claim, but again, we don't know the content. 

Wait, another angle: The pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two gunshots. So that's a contradiction. The pistol was fired three times, but she only heard two. That could be a contradiction between Evidence 10 and Testimony (Evidence 11). But the user is asking for a testimony (from the Testimonies list) and an evidence. Testimony 0 is from Lotta, and Evidence 11 is Lotta's deposition, which is part of the evidences, not the testimonies. Wait, Testimonies are a separate list. The Testimonies provided are only Testimony 0 here. Wait, looking back at the user's input:

Testimonies:
Testimony 0
Testimony: I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!
Person: Lotta

So only Testimony 0 is given here. The other info like Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) is part of the evidences. So the user is asking to compare the testimonies (which are separate) with the evidences. So the testimonies are statements made by characters during the trial, while the evidences are collected items. So in this case, Testimony 0 is Lotta's statement during testimony, and Evidence 11 is her deposition (which might be part of the evidence collected, perhaps a written statement).

Wait, the user's instruction says: "You are provided with a list of characters, evidences and testimonies. Which evidence and testimony contradict each other?" So testimonies are separate from evidences. So in the given data, Testimony 0 is by Lotta, and the Evidences include Evidence 11: Lotta's Deposition, which says she heard two gunshots. So maybe there's a contradiction between Testimony 0 and Evidence 11. Wait, but Testimony 0 is about seeing Edgeworth on the boat, and Evidence 11 is about hearing two gunshots. Not directly related. Alternatively, perhaps Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) taken at 12:15 AM, which is after the gunshots (just after midnight on 12/25), and if that photo doesn't show Edgeworth on the boat, it contradicts Testimony 0. But since the photo's content isn't described, we can't be sure. 

Alternatively, the murder weapon (Evidence 10) has Edgeworth's prints, but maybe there's a testimony where he denies touching it, but in this case, the testimonies provided are only Testimony 0 by Lotta. So the only testimony to consider is Lotta's. 

Wait, the problem might be that Lotta's Testimony 0 says she saw Edgeworth on the boat, but the camera (Evidence 2) automatically took a photo when a loud noise (the gunshots) was detected. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) was taken at 12:15 AM, which would be after the gunshots. If that photo shows the boat but not Edgeworth, or someone else, it contradicts her testimony. However, without knowing the photo's content, this is speculative. But perhaps the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) and the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) show that the boat wasn't present at 11:50 PM, but was there at 12:15 AM. If the murder happened at midnight, then the boat appearing at 12:15 AM might not contradict. But if the camera's photo (Evidence 4) shows no one on the boat, then that would contradict Lotta's testimony. However, since the user hasn't provided the photo's details, this is hard to confirm. 

Alternatively, consider the DL-6 Incident. The murder weapon in this case (Evidence 10) is a 22-caliber pistol, and the DL-6 Bullet (Evidence 21) is from Gregory Edgeworth's heart. Maybe there's a connection, but how does that contradict the testimony?

Another possibility: The Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times, but the victim was killed by one shot (Evidence 3: Autopsy Report). So three shots fired, one hit the victim. That's consistent. No contradiction there.

Wait, Lotta's Testimony 0 says she saw Edgeworth on the boat. If the boat was at Gourd Lake, and the Caretaker (Yanni Yogi) thinks he runs a restaurant but actually runs a boat rental, maybe there's a contradiction if the boat wasn't available. But that's more about the character's delusion, not evidence vs testimony.

Hmm. Maybe the key contradiction is between Lotta's Testimony 0 (saw Edgeworth on the boat) and the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) taken at 11:50 PM showing an empty lake. If the murder happened just after midnight (as per Lotta's Deposition, Evidence 11), then the boat might have been there after 11:50 PM. So maybe no contradiction. Unless the photo taken at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) shows no boat, contradicting her testimony. But again, we don't have the photo's content.

Wait, but the user's previous example in the first question had a direct contradiction between a testimony denying touching the weapon and evidence showing prints. So maybe here, a similar contradiction exists. Let's check all testimonies again. The only testimony here is Testimony 0 by Lotta: "I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!" So looking for evidence that contradicts this. 

Looking at Evidence 16: Second Lake Photo taken at 11:50 PM on 24th shows empty lake. If the murder occurred on 25th after midnight, the boat wasn't present at 11:50 PM, but could have been there later. So no direct contradiction. However, Evidence 4: Lake Photo taken at 12:15 AM on 25th. If that photo shows the boat but not Edgeworth, that contradicts Lotta's testimony. But without the photo's content, we can't be sure. Alternatively, if the camera (Evidence 2) is set to take photos when a loud noise is detected (like gunshots), and the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) was triggered by the gunshot at midnight, then the photo would show the scene at that time. If Lotta's testimony claims she saw Edgeworth on the boat at that time, but the photo shows no one there, that's a contradiction. But since the user hasn't provided the photo's details, maybe the answer assumes that the photo shows something conflicting. 

Alternatively, the murder weapon (Evidence 10) has Edgeworth's prints, which could imply he used it, but Lotta's testimony places him on the boat. But that's not a direct contradiction unless someone else's prints are also on the weapon. 

Wait, another angle: The DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18) might relate to Gregory Edgeworth's murder. The current victim is Robert Hammond, who was the defense attorney in the DL-6 case. The murder weapon in this case (Evidence 10) has Miles Edgeworth's prints. If Miles was being set up, maybe the real killer is someone else, but that's more about the plot, not a direct evidence-testimony contradiction.

Alternatively, the Overhead Map (Evidence 8) might show that the boat's location is visible from Lotta's camera. If the camera's photo (Evidence 4) doesn't show the boat, that contradicts her testimony. But again, without knowing the photo's content, this is speculative.

Given the information provided, the most likely contradiction is between Lotta's Testimony 0 (saw Edgeworth on the boat) and the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) showing the lake empty at 11:50 PM on 24th. However, if the murder occurred on the 25th, the boat could have been there later. But if the time of death is between 24th or 25th, perhaps the murder happened on the 24th, and the photo at 11:50 PM shows no boat, contradicting Lotta's testimony that she saw Edgeworth on the boat during the murder. But the autopsy report (Evidence 3) states time of death is 24th or 25th. If the murder was on the 24th, then the Second Lake Photo at 11:50 PM showing no boat contradicts her testimony. But if the murder was on the 25th, then no. However, Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard gunshots just after midnight on 12/25, placing the murder on the 25th. So the Second Lake Photo (24th) wouldn't contradict that. Therefore, the contradiction must be elsewhere.

Another angle: The murder weapon (Evidence 10) has Edgeworth's prints, which implies he used it. If he was on the boat (per Lotta's testimony), that's consistent. Unless there's a testimony where he denies being there, but there isn't. The only testimony here is Lotta's.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Lotta's Testimony 0 and the Lake Photo (Evidence 4). If the Lake Photo was taken at 12:15 AM and shows no boat or no Edgeworth, it contradicts her testimony. But since the user hasn't provided that detail, maybe the answer relies on another evidence. Alternatively, maybe the Pistol (Evidence 10) being fired three times, but Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two sounds like gunshots. That's a contradiction between Evidence 10 and Evidence 11, but the user is asking for a testimony (from Testimonies list) and evidence. Testimony 0 is the only testimony here. So perhaps the answer is that there's a contradiction between Testimony 0 (Lotta saw Edgeworth on the boat) and the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) if the photo shows otherwise. But without knowing the photo's content, maybe the user expects us to assume that the Lake Photo (taken automatically when the gunshot was heard) shows something different, like the boat not being there or someone else. Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo), but the timing might not align.

I'm a bit stuck, but in the previous example, the contradiction was between a testimony denying touching the weapon and evidence showing prints. Here, perhaps the contradiction is similar but with different evidence and testimony. 

Alternatively, looking at the Pistol (Evidence 10) having Edgeworth's prints, but if there's a testimony where he denies touching it. However, in the provided testimonies, the only testimony is Lotta's. The other testimonies from the first example aren't present here. So maybe there's no contradiction in this case, but the user is asking to find one. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, the user's answer in the first example compared a testimony by Phoenix about not touching the murder weapon with the evidence showing his prints. So perhaps here, the contradiction is between Lotta's testimony (Testimony 0) and a piece of evidence that shows she couldn't have seen Edgeworth. For example, if the camera took a photo at the time of the murder and Edgeworth wasn't there. 

Given that Lotta's Camera (Evidence 2) is set to take photos when a loud noise (gunshot) is detected, and the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) was taken at 12:15 AM, which is just after midnight when the gunshots were heard. If the photo from Evidence 4 shows the boat but not Edgeworth, then that contradicts Lotta's testimony. However, since the photo's content isn't described, we have to infer. Alternatively, the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) taken at 11:50 PM shows no boat, and the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) at 12:15 AM shows a boat with someone else, contradicting Lotta's claim. But again, without photo details, it's hard. 

Alternatively, the DL-6 Incident Photo (Evidence 19) might show something related, but I'm not sure.

Given the available data, the most plausible contradiction is between Lotta's Testimony 0 and the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) if the murder happened on the 24th. But since the gunshots were on the 25th, that's not the case. Alternatively, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM on 25th contradicts her testimony if it shows no boat. But since the user hasn't given that detail, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. 

Wait, maybe the answer is that Lotta's Testimony 0 (saw Edgeworth on the boat) contradicts the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) which shows the lake empty at 11:50 PM on 24th. But if the murder was on the 25th, the boat could have been there after 11:50. However, if the time of death is on the 24th, then the photo at 11:50 PM shows the lake empty, contradicting the presence of the boat. But the autopsy report (Evidence 3) says time of death is 24th or 25th, so it's ambiguous. 

Alternatively, the camera (Evidence 2) took a photo at the time of the gunshots (Evidence 11: just after midnight), which is the Lake Photo (Evidence 4). If that photo shows the boat with someone else, or no one, it contradicts Lotta's testimony. But without that info, I'm not sure. 

Wait, considering the user's previous example, where the contradiction was clear between testimony and evidence, perhaps here the answer is Testimony 0 (Lotta's statement) and Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo). But I need to confirm the timing. The murder occurred just after midnight on 25th, per Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11). The Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) is on 24th at 11:50 PM, showing empty lake. The murder was on 25th, so the boat could have arrived after 11:50 PM. Therefore, no contradiction. 

Wait, but maybe the murder occurred before midnight. If the time of death is on the 24th, then the Second Lake Photo at 11:50 PM would show the lake empty, contradicting Lotta's claim. But the autopsy report says time of death is 24th or 25th. If the prosecution claims it's on the 24th, but Lotta's testimony places it on the 25th, that's a contradiction. But the user is asking for evidence and testimony contradicting, not between testimonies and time of death. 

I think the most likely intended answer is that the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) contradicts Lotta's testimony, but since its content isn't described, perhaps it's another evidence. Alternatively, perhaps the Overhead Map (Evidence 8) shows that the boat's location wasn't visible from where Lotta was, contradicting her testimony. But that's speculative. 

Given the information, the best possible answer is that Lotta's Testimony 0 (seeing Edgeworth on the boat) contradicts the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) showing the lake empty at 11:50 PM, assuming the murder happened earlier. But the timing might not align. 

Alternatively, the user might expect the contradiction between Testimony 0 and Evidence 4, assuming the photo shows no boat. But without details, it's a guess. However, since the previous example used a direct contradiction between prints and testimony, perhaps here it's between Testimony 0 and Evidence 10 (Pistol with Edgeworth's prints), but that's not a contradiction unless Edgeworth claims he wasn't there. 

Wait, no. The testimony is Lotta's, not Edgeworth's. So if Lotta says she saw Edgeworth on the boat, and the pistol has his prints, that's consistent. No contradiction there. 

Hmm. Given the time I've spent and the information available, I'll go with the contradiction between Testimony 0 (Lotta's testimony) and Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) because if the lake was empty at 11:50 PM, and the murder happened just after midnight, but Lotta's testimony requires the boat to be there, then perhaps the boat wasn't there yet. However, the timing allows for the boat to arrive after 11:50 PM. So maybe that's not it. 

Another angle: The murder weapon has Edgeworth's prints, but if Lotta's testimony places him on the boat at the time of the murder, which is consistent. But maybe another evidence contradicts his presence. 

I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo showing empty lake at 11:50 PM), implying that the boat wasn't there, but Lotta claims to have seen it later. But the murder was on the 25th, so the boat could be there after midnight. So no contradiction. 

Alternatively, the camera (Evidence 2) took a photo automatically when the gunshot was heard (Evidence 11), which is the Lake Photo (Evidence 4). If this photo does not show Edgeworth on the boat, it contradicts Testimony 0. Since the user mentioned "Click here for details" but we don't have them, maybe it's assumed that the photo doesn't show him. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 4. But the user would need to make that assumption. 

I think that's the most plausible answer the user expects. So {"evidence": 4, "testimony": 0} because the photo taken at the time of the murder (Evidence 4) contradicts Lotta's testimony that she saw Edgeworth on the boat.

Let's think step by step:
Lotta Hart's Testimony 0 claims she saw Edgeworth on the boat during the murder. Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) shows the lake empty at 11:50 PM on 12/24, and Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) was taken at 12:15 AM on 12/25. If the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken just after the murder (as per the gunshots heard at midnight) does not show Edgeworth or the boat, it directly contradicts Lotta's testimony. However, since Evidence 4's content isn't explicitly described, the contradiction is inferred based on timing and the camera's trigger mechanism.
{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 0}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to find a contradiction between one of the evidences and one of the testimonies provided. Let's start by listing out all the testimonies and then cross-reference them with the evidence.

The testimonies are all from Lotta Hart:

Testimony 0: She mentions it was a cold night with thick mist.
Testimony 1: She says she finished setting up her camera and got back in the car.
Testimony 2: She brought her binoculars.
Testimony 3: The camera was set up for a meteor shower.
Testimony 4: When she heard a noise on the lake, she looked with her binoculars.

Now, looking at the evidences, particularly Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) which is set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected and faces the lake. Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) was taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) shows an empty lake taken on 12/24 at 11:50 PM. Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) states she heard two gunshots just after midnight on 12/25.

Wait, Testimony 3 says the camera was set up for a meteor shower. But Evidence 3's autopsy report mentions the time of death as 24th or 25th. The camera's setup (Evidence 2) is to take pictures when a loud noise is detected. However, Lotta's Testimony 3 claims the camera was for a meteor shower. That seems contradictory because meteor showers wouldn't necessarily trigger the camera based on sound. The camera's automatic trigger is sound, not visual. So if the camera was set for meteor shower (which is a visual event), the setup should be timed or motion-based, not sound-activated. Therefore, Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 2's description of the camera being triggered by loud noises. 

Alternatively, Testimony 4 says she used binoculars when she heard a noise. But Evidence 2's camera should have taken a photo automatically when the noise (gunshots) happened. Evidence 4's photo was taken at 12:15 AM, which aligns with the gunshot time (after midnight on 12/25). But if the camera was set for meteor showers (Testimony 3), perhaps there's a contradiction there. Wait, maybe the camera was supposed to photograph the meteor shower, but instead it was triggered by the gunshots. But that's not a direct contradiction. Hmm.

Wait, let's recheck. Testimony 3: "The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower." But Evidence 2 says the camera is set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected. So the purpose (meteor shower) vs the mechanism (sound trigger) don't align. Meteor showers are silent, so the camera wouldn't capture them via sound activation. Therefore, Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 2 because the camera's setup as described in Evidence 2 wouldn't capture a meteor shower, which is a silent event. Hence, Lotta's statement about the camera's purpose contradicts the evidence about how the camera actually works.

Let's analyze the testimonies and evidences step by step. Testimony 3 states Lotta set up her camera to photograph a meteor shower. However, Evidence 2 describes the camera as being triggered by loud noises, not visual cues like a meteor shower. Since meteor showers are silent, the camera's sound-based activation contradicts the stated purpose of capturing the meteor shower. This inconsistency reveals a contradiction between Testimony 3 and Evidence 2.
{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a bunch of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The goal is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The previous example showed that when a testimony claims someone didn't touch a murder weapon, but the evidence shows their prints on it, that's a contradiction. Let's apply similar logic here.

First, I need to go through each testimony and see if any of them directly conflict with the evidence provided. Let's list out the testimonies and the relevant evidence.

Looking at the testimonies, Lotta Hart is the person giving all of them (Testimonies 0-7). Let's check each one:

Testimony 0: She says she's not a research student. Evidence 3 (Lotta's Camera) mentions she claims to be a research student, which is part of her description. Wait, no, the evidence's name is "Lotta's Camera" and the description says she claims to be a research student. Wait, actually, in the Characters section, Lotta's description is "Claims to be a research student. She's camped out to photograph shooting stars." So Testimony 0 is her admitting she's not a research student, which contradicts her own description. But the question is about evidence and testimony contradictions. Hmm, maybe not. Let's check other testimonies.

Testimony 1: She says she's an investigative photographer. That might align with her camera (Evidence 2). Not a contradiction.

Testimony 2: She wanted a photo of the monster (Gourdy, as per Evidence 5). That's consistent with her actions.

Testimony 3: She was camping by the lake. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) and Second Lake Photo (16) support that she was there. No contradiction.

Testimony 4: "But that's all I was hiding." Maybe implying she's hiding something else? Not sure. Need to check what's in the evidence.

Testimony 5: She heard a "bang" and looked at the lake. Evidence 1 is a Popper, which makes a bang sound. But maybe the timing? Let's see.

Testimony 6: She watched the boat the whole time. If the camera was facing the lake (Evidence 2's description), and the photos were taken automatically when loud noises happened, then perhaps the photos should show something. Let's look at the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM on 12/25 and Second Lake Photo (16) at 11:50 PM on 12/24. The Autopsy Report (3) says death was 24th or 25th. Testimony 7: She saw a flash and heard another gunshot. So maybe the camera captured something related to the gunshots.

Wait, the Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. Lotta's Deposition (11) says she heard two sounds like gunshots after midnight on 12/25. But the Lake Photo (4) is taken at 12:15 AM on 12/25. If the camera was set to take pictures on loud noises, then the gunshots should have triggered it. However, the Pistol was fired three times. But according to Lotta's Testimony 7, she heard another gunshot after the initial bang. But the camera's photo at 12:15 AM might not show the boat if she was watching it. Let me check the Lake Photo's description: "Taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Click here for details." The Second Lake Photo (16) is at 11:50 PM on 12/24, showing an empty lake. If the murder happened around midnight, maybe the 12:15 AM photo would show something, but if the boat was there, but the Second Lake Photo at 11:50 PM shows it empty, then perhaps there's a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time. If the Second Lake Photo (16) was taken at 11:50 PM and shows an empty lake, but Lotta was watching the boat the whole time after that (after midnight), then maybe the boat wasn't there earlier. But if the murder happened on the boat, maybe there's a contradiction. Alternatively, the Pistol has Edgeworth's prints, but maybe the timing of the photos and the testimonies about the gunshots.

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Lotta's Testimony 7 where she says she saw a flash near one of the men's hands and heard another gunshot, and the Pistol (Evidence 10) which was fired three times. But the camera (Evidence 2) was set to take pictures when loud noises occurred. So each gunshot should trigger the camera. But the Lake Photo (4) was taken at 12:15 AM, which would correspond to a gunshot at that time. However, Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) states she heard two gunshots just after midnight on 12/25, which is around the same time. If the Pistol was fired three times, but the camera only captured two instances (maybe the 12:15 AM and another?), but the Lake Photo might show something conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the camera didn't capture the third shot. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time, but the Second Lake Photo (16) taken at 11:50 PM on 12/24 shows an empty lake, implying the boat wasn't there then. If the murder happened on the boat after midnight (on 12/25), then the boat would have been present later. But maybe if the boat wasn't there at 11:50 PM, but Lotta was watching it the whole time after that, including when the murder happened, that's not a contradiction. Unless there's a photo that shows the boat wasn't there when she claims to have seen it.

Alternatively, consider the Autopsy Report (3) states time of death as 24th or 25th, but the Lake Photo at 12:15 AM on 25th shows the scene. If the murder occurred on the 24th, but the photo on the 25th shows something inconsistent. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 5 says when she heard the "bang" (which could be the Popper, Evidence 1, which is a noisemaker), she looked at the lake. Then Testimony 7 says she heard another gunshot and saw a flash. The Popper's bang might have triggered the camera once, and the actual gunshots triggered it again. But the camera (Evidence 2) is set to take a picture when a loud noise is detected. If there were two gunshots (as per Lotta's Deposition, Evidence 11), then there should be two photos. But Evidence 4 is one Lake Photo taken at 12:15 AM, and Evidence 16 is another at 11:50 PM. Wait, Evidence 16 is the Second Lake Photo taken on 12/24 at 11:50 PM, which is before midnight, and Evidence 4 is on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. If the two gunshots happened after midnight (on 12/25), then the camera should have taken two photos. However, there's only one Lake Photo (Evidence 4) mentioned for 12/25. This could imply that the camera only took one photo, which contradicts the two gunshots. But maybe the two gunshots were close in time, and the camera only captured one? Not sure. Alternatively, the Popper's bang (Evidence 1) could have been the first sound, triggering the camera at 12:15 AM, and the actual gunshots happened after, but the camera didn't capture them because it was already triggered once. But the testimony says she heard two gunshots after midnight. So if the camera only has one photo, that's a problem.

Wait, the Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. So three shots. Lotta's Deposition (11) says she heard two. Maybe one of the shots was from the Popper (the "bang"), but that's a noisemaker. Alternatively, the three shots from the pistol would mean three loud noises, but the camera only took two photos (Evidence 4 and 16). But Evidence 16 is from 12/24, so only one on 12/25. So if there were three shots, the camera should have three photos, but there's only one. That's a contradiction. But which testimony contradicts that? Let me check the testimonies again.

Testimony 7: She heard another gunshot after the initial bang. So two gunshots. The deposition (11) also mentions two. But the Pistol was fired three times. So that's a contradiction between Evidence 10 (three shots) and Testimony 11 (two heard). Wait, but Testimony 11 is Lotta's Deposition, which is actually Evidence 11. Wait, no: Testimonies are separate from Evidence. The Testimonies here are Testimony 0-7, all by Lotta. The Deposition is Evidence 11, which is a separate piece of evidence. So the user is asking for a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony. So, for example, if a testimony says something that an evidence contradicts.

Looking at Testimony 7: "Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot." So she heard another gunshot, implying at least two: the initial "bang" (maybe the Popper) and then a gunshot. But the Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. So if the Pistol was fired three times, but Lotta only testifies to hearing two, that's a discrepancy. But Testimony 7 is about a specific instance where she heard another gunshot. The deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two sounds like gunshots after midnight. So maybe the contradiction is between the Pistol (Evidence 10) being fired three times and the Testimony 7 plus Deposition (Evidence 11) stating two. However, the question asks for a contradiction between a testimony and evidence, not between two evidences. So if a testimony says she heard two, but the evidence says three shots, that's a contradiction. But the Pistol's evidence says it was fired three times. So if Lotta's testimony mentions hearing two, but the gun was fired three times, that's a contradiction. However, Testimony 7 is about hearing another gunshot, which would be the second one. Wait, Testimony 5: "When I heard the 'bang' I looked right straight out at that lake." Then Testimony 7: "heard another gunshot." So that's two sounds: the 'bang' (possibly the Popper) and the gunshot. But the Pistol was fired three times, so there should be three shots. However, the camera (Evidence 2) is set to take a photo on loud noises. If three shots were fired, the camera should have three photos. But we only have two Lake Photos: one at 11:50 PM on 24th (empty) and one at 12:15 AM on 25th. So perhaps the three shots aren't all captured by the camera, leading to a contradiction. Alternatively, the testimony about hearing two gunshots contradicts the Pistol's three shots. But which testimony exactly?

Alternatively, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM shows the lake, but if Lotta was watching the boat the whole time (Testimony 6) and the photo shows something different, like no boat, that would contradict. But the Second Lake Photo (16) at 11:50 PM shows an empty lake. If the boat arrived after that, then the 12:15 AM photo (Evidence 4) might show the boat. But if Lotta was watching the boat the whole time after midnight, but the 12:15 AM photo shows it, that's consistent. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: The Pistol (Evidence 10) has Edgeworth's prints. But maybe someone else's prints should be there. But no testimonies directly address that.

Alternatively, Testimony 6: "I just watched that boat the whole time." If the Lake Photo (4) taken at 12:15 AM shows the boat, that's consistent. But if the boat wasn't there, that's a problem. But the Second Lake Photo (16) is at 11:50 PM, showing empty. So if the boat arrived after that, then Evidence 4 would show it. But without knowing the details of the photo, it's hard to say. The user might be expecting a different contradiction.

Wait, let's think of the obvious contradictions. The classic one is when a testimony says "I didn't do X" but evidence shows they did. For example, in the previous example, the testimony said "I didn't touch the weapon," but the evidence had fingerprints. Let's check if any testimony here claims something that evidence contradicts.

Looking at the testimonies again:

Testimony 0: "I'm not a research student." But her character description says she claims to be one. But that's her own testimony contradicting her own description, which is part of the character info, not evidence. The question is about evidence and testimony contradictions. So perhaps not.

Testimony 4: "But that's all I was hiding." Maybe she's hiding something else, but evidence might contradict that. But which evidence?

Testimony 7: She saw a flash and heard another gunshot. The Pistol (10) was fired three times. If she only heard two, but the gun was fired three times, that's a contradiction. But she might not have heard the third shot, perhaps because it was muffled. Or maybe one of the shots was the Popper. Alternatively, the Popper's bang (Evidence 1) was the first sound, then two gunshots, totaling three sounds. But the Pistol's three shots would then be accounted for. Hmm, but the Popper isn't a real gunshot. So if the Pistol was fired three times, but Lotta only testifies to two gunshots, that's a contradiction. But she also mentions a "bang" which could be the Popper. So maybe the total sounds are three: Popper's bang, then two gunshots. But the Pistol was fired three times. So that would mean one gunshot unaccounted for. But the camera's photos would have been triggered by each loud noise. So three photos, but we only have two (assuming Evidence 4 and another). But the evidences listed are up to 21, but Lake Photo (4) and Second Lake Photo (16) are two. So maybe only two photos exist, contradicting the three shots. But which testimony contradicts this? Lotta's Testimony 5 and 7 mention hearing a bang and another gunshot. Her Deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two gunshots. The Pistol (10) fired three times. So the contradiction is between Evidence 10 (three shots) and Testimony 11 (two heard). But Testimony 11 is actually Evidence 11, which is Lotta's deposition. Wait, no. The testimonies are separate from the evidence. The user lists Testimonies 0-7, all by Lotta. The Evidences include Lotta's Deposition (11) which says she heard two gunshots. So if the Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times, then Evidence 10 contradicts Evidence 11. But the question is about evidence and testimony contradictions. The testimonies are separate. So looking at the testimonies given by the characters (Lotta's Testimonies 0-7), which one contradicts an evidence.

Wait, Testimony 5: "When I heard the 'bang' I looked right straight out at that lake." Testimony 7: "Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot." So she heard a bang (maybe the Popper) and then two gunshots (another and another?), totaling three sounds. But the Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times, so that's consistent. But the Popper's bang is a separate noise. So total four sounds? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the 'bang' in Testimony 5 is the first gunshot, then another in Testimony 7. But the Pistol was fired three times. So that would be two gunshots mentioned, but three fired. So the testimony doesn't account for the third shot. But unless there's a testimony that explicitly states the number of shots heard, the contradiction might not be direct.

Alternatively, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) was taken at 12:15 AM, which would correspond to one loud noise. The Second Lake Photo (16) is at 11:50 PM, which is before the murder. So only one photo was taken after midnight. But if the Pistol was fired three times, the camera should have three photos. But only one exists, which contradicts. However, the camera might have a cooldown or only take one photo. The description of Lotta's Camera (Evidence 2) says it's set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected. So each loud noise should trigger a photo. If three shots were fired, three photos. But we only have Evidence 4 (12:15 AM) and maybe others? The user lists up to Evidence 21, but the relevant ones are 4 and 16. So the existence of only one photo after midnight (Evidence 4) contradicts the three shots from the Pistol (Evidence 10), implying that the camera should have three photos, but only one exists. But this would be a contradiction between Evidence 10 and Evidence 2/4. But the question asks for a testimony and evidence contradiction.

Alternatively, Lotta's Testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time. If the Lake Photo (4) taken at 12:15 AM shows the boat, that's fine. But if the boat wasn't in the photo, that contradicts her testimony. But without knowing the photo's details, it's hard to say. The description of Evidence 4 just says it's taken automatically, but maybe it shows something that contradicts her testimony.

Alternatively, Testimony 7 says she saw a flash near one of the men's hands when she heard another gunshot. The Pistol (Evidence 10) has Edgeworth's prints. If the flash was from the Pistol, but the prints are Edgeworth's, but his testimony isn't listed here. Not sure.

Wait, the Autopsy Report (3) says the victim was shot from approximately one meter away. The Pistol (10) has Edgeworth's prints. If Edgeworth was the shooter, but Testimony 6 says Lotta watched the boat the whole time and didn't see him, that could be a contradiction. But Edgeworth is a prosecutor, not necessarily on the boat. Wait, the characters include Miles Edgeworth (Character 1), but the scenario isn't clear. Alternatively, the contradiction is elsewhere.

Another angle: Testimony 0: Lotta admits she's not a research student, but her camera (Evidence 2) is described as belonging to someone who claims to be a research student. Wait, in the Characters section, Lotta's description is "Claims to be a research student. She's camped out to photograph shooting stars." So her Testimony 0 contradicts her own description, but the evidence (her camera) doesn't directly state that she's a research student. The camera's description is "Set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected. Faces the lake." So maybe the contradiction isn't between her testimony and evidence, but between her testimony and her character description. But the question specifies evidence and testimony contradictions.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again. The previous example had the testimony denying touching the murder weapon, but evidence shows prints. Here, looking for a similar contradiction.

The Pistol (Evidence 10) has Edgeworth's prints. If any testimony claims he didn't touch it, but there's no such testimony here. The testimonies are all by Lotta.

Wait, the Testimonies are all by Lotta. So maybe her testimony contradicts some evidence. For example, she says she heard two gunshots (Testimony 7 and 5), but the Pistol was fired three times (Evidence 10). So the contradiction is between Testimony 7 (and others) implying two shots and Evidence 10 stating three. But Testimony 7 mentions another gunshot, which would be the second one. If there's a third shot, but she didn't mention it, that's a discrepancy. However, she might not have heard the third one, or it's possible she's not testifying about all the shots. But the question wants one pair where evidence and testimony directly contradict.

Alternatively, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows the lake at 12:15 AM, which should have captured the scene after the gunshots. If Lotta's Testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time, but the photo shows no boat, that's a contradiction. But the photo's description doesn't specify, but Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) taken at 11:50 PM shows an empty lake. If the boat was only there after midnight, then Evidence 4 should show it. If Lotta was watching it, but the photo doesn't show the boat, that's a contradiction. But without photo details, it's hard to confirm.

Alternatively, consider the timing of the murder. The Autopsy Report (3) says time of death is 24th or 25th. The Lake Photo (4) is on the 25th at 12:15 AM. If the murder occurred at that time, and the Pistol was fired three times, but the camera only captured one photo (at 12:15), that suggests only one loud noise, contradicting the three shots. But Lotta's Testimony 7 says she heard another gunshot, implying two shots. So the contradiction is between the number of shots fired (3 per Evidence 10) and the number heard (2 per Testimony 7 and Evidence 11). But since the question wants a testimony (from the list) and evidence contradiction, the relevant testimony would be Testimony 7 where she mentions hearing another gunshot, implying two total, but Evidence 10 says three shots were fired. Thus, the contradiction is between Testimony 7 (and others) stating two gunshots and Evidence 10 stating three. However, the user's answer should only output one pair. But which testimony number is it?

Looking back: Testimony 7 is "Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot." The word "another" implies at least two: the initial bang (maybe Testimony 5's 'bang') and this one. So that's two. If the Pistol was fired three times, then there's a third shot unaccounted for. But how does that contradict directly? Unless the camera's photos show only two loud noises, but the Pistol had three. Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 6 (watching the boat the whole time) and the Lake Photo showing no boat. But without photo details, it's speculative.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Lotta's Testimony 6 where she says she watched the boat the whole time, and the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) taken at 11:50 PM showing an empty lake. If the boat wasn't there at 11:50 PM, but she started watching after midnight (Testimony 3 says she was camping by the lake, Testimony 6 says she watched the boat the whole time after hearing the bang), then the boat should have been there after midnight. But the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM might show the boat, confirming her testimony. If the boat wasn't in Evidence 4, that's a contradiction. But since we don't have the photo's content details, maybe the timings are key.

Wait, the Autopsy Report says time of death is 24th or 25th. If the murder occurred on the 24th, but the Lake Photo on the 25th at 12:15 AM shows the aftermath, maybe that's consistent. Not sure.

Another possibility: The Popper (Evidence 1) makes a bang sound, which Lotta refers to in Testimony 5. The camera would have taken a photo at that time (12:15 AM?), but the Pistol's three shots would mean three more photos. But the camera only has two photos (4 and 16), with 16 being before. So the Popper's bang and three gunshots would be four sounds, leading to four photos, but only one exists. This contradicts, but again, not directly linked to a testimony.

I think the most straightforward contradiction is between the number of gunshots fired (Evidence 10: three) and the number heard by Lotta (Testimony 7 and others implying two). But to fit the required format, we need to pick one testimony. Testimony 7 is about hearing another gunshot, which would be the second. So if three were fired, that's a contradiction. So the evidence is 10 (Pistol, three shots) and testimony is 7 (hearing another, implying only two). Thus, {"evidence": 10, "testimony": 7}.

Alternatively, the Lake Photo (4) was taken at 12:15 AM, which would be triggered by a loud noise. If the Pistol was fired three times, there should be three photos, but only one exists. This would contradict, but the testimony about hearing the noises doesn't directly state the number of photos. The contradiction here would be between the number of shots and the number of photos, but that involves multiple pieces of evidence, not a single testimony.

Alternatively, Lotta's Testimony 6 claims she watched the boat the whole time, but the Second Lake Photo (16) taken at 11:50 PM shows no boat. If the boat wasn't there then, but she started watching after midnight, maybe there's no contradiction. Unless the murder happened on the 24th, but the photo on the 25th shows nothing. Not sure.

I think the most likely answer the user expects is the contradiction between the Pistol being fired three times (Evidence 10) and Lotta's testimony (Testimony 7) implying only two gunshots. Thus:

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 7}

Let's analyze the testimonies and evidence:
- **Testimony 7** by Lotta states she heard "another gunshot" after an initial sound, implying **two gunshots**.
- **Evidence 10** (Pistol) indicates the weapon was fired **three times**. This directly contradicts Lotta's testimony about the number of shots heard.
  
{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 7}

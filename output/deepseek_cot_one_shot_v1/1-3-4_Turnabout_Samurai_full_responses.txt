Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters are listed, but maybe the key is in the evidence and testimonies. Let me go through each testimony and see if any evidence directly contradicts it.

First, looking at the testimonies. All of them are from Cody Hackins (Character 8). Let's check each one.

Testimony 0: Cody wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal. Not sure about contradiction here yet.

Testimony 1: He found a map online and went to the studios. Evidence 2 is a Guidemap. Maybe related, but not a contradiction.

Testimony 2: He went through the woods off the path to avoid an old lady (Security Lady?). If the Security Lady claims she saw Powers heading to the scene (Character 4's description), but that's about Powers, not Cody. Not sure yet.

Testimony 3: He was going to the studio. Again, no obvious contradiction.

Testimony 4: He got lost for 30 minutes. Hmm. Let's check the evidence. Evidence 5 is Powers'(?) Photo, taken at the gate at 2:00 PM. But maybe Cody's timing?

Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 3) says time of death is 2:30 PM. Cody's testimony 5 says when he came out by the studio, he saw the Steel Samurai. If he got lost for 30 minutes, then when he arrived, maybe around 2:30 PM? But then he saw the Steel Samurai (which could be the murderer). But how does this relate to evidence?

Wait, Evidence 11 is Mr. Monkey's Head, which blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. If the path was blocked during that time, how did Cody get through? In his testimony 2, he says he went through the woods, off the path. That might explain avoiding the blocked path. But where's the contradiction?

Wait, Testimony 8: Cody says if he had his camera, that would've been the time for a shot. But Evidence 15 is Cody's Camera, which he always carries. So if he says he didn't have the camera (Testimony 8: "If I had my camera..."), but the evidence says he does carry it. That's a contradiction. Because the camera is listed as evidence, meaning he had it, but his testimony says he didn't. So Evidence 15 (Cody's Camera) contradicts Testimony 8.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 8 states, "If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot..." implying Cody didn't have his camera. However, Evidence 15 (Cody's Camera) notes he "always carries it," directly contradicting his claim.
{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 8}
Okay, let's try to figure this out. The task is to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. The user wants only one pair, and the answer should be in JSON at the end.

First, let me go through the testimonies and the evidences. The characters are Maya, Edgeworth, Gumshoe, Will Powers (the defendant), Security Lady, Jack Hammer (victim), Assistant, Director, Cody Hackins, Dee Vasquez. The evidences range from autopsy reports to photos and various items related to the crime scene.

Looking at the testimonies, all of them are from Cody. Testimonies 0 to 5. Let's check each one:

Testimony 0: "Yeah, you're right, pops." Not sure what this relates to yet.

Testimony 1: "The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain." This seems like describing a scene he witnessed, maybe related to the show or the incident.

Testimony 2: "So I held up my camera to take a picture!" He tried taking a photo.

Testimony 3: "But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it." So he couldn't take the picture because the lens didn't open.

Testimony 4: "Th-that's all that happened. Yup." Concluding his statement.

Testimony 5: "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em." Wait, here he says he took some shots but erased them because they were too late. But in Testimony 3, he said the lens wouldn't open, so he missed the shot. So there's a contradiction between Testimony 3 and Testimony 5. However, the question asks for a contradiction between evidence and testimony, not between testimonies.

Now, looking at the evidences. Let's see which evidence could contradict Cody's testimonies. Let's look at Evidence 15: Cody's Camera. Description: A new digital camera. Cody always carries it, though he's still learning how to use it.

Wait, maybe there's more. Let me check if any evidence directly relates to the photos he took. There's Evidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo, taken at the gate on Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2, showing him dragging one leg. But that's about Will Powers, not Cody's photos.

Evidence 15 is Cody's own camera. If he said he erased the photos because they were too late (Testimony 5), but maybe the camera's data shows something else. However, the evidence description doesn't mention any photos being present. Hmm.

Wait, there's another evidence: Evidence 14: "Path to Glory" which has photos of every victory scene. But that's probably unrelated. 

Alternatively, maybe Evidence 15: Cody's Camera. If he erased the photos, but the camera's memory might still have traces. But the evidence description doesn't say anything about that. It just mentions he's still learning to use it. So maybe if he claims he erased them, but there's evidence that the photos still exist. But the evidence provided doesn't mention that. 

Wait, maybe the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) says time of death at 2:30 PM. If the Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene, and Powers'(?) Photo (Evidence 5) shows him at 2:00 PM dragging a leg. If Powers was at the gate at 2:00 PM, but the murder was at 2:30 PM, that's possible. But how does that contradict a testimony from Cody?

Alternatively, let's think about the timeline. The murder was at 2:30 PM. The Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) blocked the path from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. So if someone needed to get to the scene after 2:15 PM, they couldn't. But maybe Cody's testimony about taking photos relates to the timing. If he was trying to take a picture of something that happened when the path was blocked, but he couldn't have been there. Not sure.

Wait, Testimony 1: The Steel Samurai escaping the villain. If that's part of the show, but maybe the actual murder happened during that scene. But how does that tie in?

Alternatively, Cody's Testimony 2 and 3: He tried to take a picture, but the lens wouldn't open. Testimony 5: He took a few shots but erased them. Contradiction here, but again, the problem is between evidence and testimony. So if there's an evidence that shows he did take photos, that would contradict his testimony. For example, if the camera (Evidence 15) has photos that he claims he erased. But the evidence description doesn't mention any photos, just that he carries it. Unless there's another evidence. Let me check again.

Looking at the evidences, maybe Evidence 15: Cody's Camera. If the camera has photos that he erased, but the camera's memory still has them, then that would contradict Testimony 5. But the evidence description doesn't state that. It just says he's learning to use it. So maybe the existence of the camera itself isn't contradictory. Hmm.

Wait, Evidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo taken at 2:00 PM. If Cody took that photo, but he says he erased all his shots. But Evidence 5 is a photo of Powers, which might have been taken by the security camera or someone else, not necessarily Cody. The description says "Taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios. [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]". So if that photo was taken by the security system, then Cody's testimony about his own photos isn't related. But if Cody's camera had the photo, then it's a contradiction. But the evidence doesn't say that.

Alternatively, maybe the camera (Evidence 15) has a photo that Cody claims he erased. Let me check the time of death: 2:30 PM. If Cody tried to take a picture around that time but the lens didn't open (Testimony 3), but the camera has a photo from that time, then that's a contradiction. But the evidence doesn't specify any photos. Hmm. This is tricky.

Wait, another angle. The murder weapon is the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6), which was mended with duct tape. If someone's testimony contradicts the condition of the spear. But the testimonies here are all from Cody about taking photos.

Wait, the Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene. The photo (Evidence 5) shows Powers at 2:00 PM dragging a leg. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM (Evidence 11), then Powers couldn't have gotten to the scene after 2:15 PM. So if the Security Lady says she saw him going there after 2:15, that's a contradiction. But the testimonies in question are from Cody, not the Security Lady.

So back to Cody's testimonies. He said in Testimony 3 that the lens wouldn't open, so he missed the shot. But in Testimony 5, he says he took a few shots but erased them. These two testimonies contradict each other. But the question asks for a contradiction between evidence and testimony. So maybe there's an evidence that shows he did take a photo, contradicting Testimony 3 or 5.

Looking at the evidences again, perhaps Evidence 15: Cody's Camera. If the camera has a photo that he claims he couldn't take or erased, but the evidence description doesn't mention any photos. Alternatively, if there's another evidence. Wait, Evidence 5 is a photo of Powers at 2:00 PM. If that photo was taken by Cody's camera, then his Testimony 3 (lens wouldn't open) would contradict, because the photo exists. But the problem is, Evidence 5 is labeled as "Powers'(?) Photo", which might be from a security camera, not Cody's. So unless Cody's camera has that photo, which is not stated.

Alternatively, maybe the camera's existence as a digital camera (Evidence 15) contradicts his Testimony 3. If the camera has a feature that the lens opens automatically, but he claims it didn't. But that's speculation. The evidence doesn't provide details about the camera's functionality.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the time of the murder. The autopsy says 2:30 PM. The path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM (Evidence 11). So if Cody was taking photos after 2:15 PM, he would have been blocked. But his testimonies don't mention the time he tried to take the photo. Unless the photo he tried to take was at a time when the path was blocked, but that's not directly stated.

Alternatively, maybe there's an evidence that shows a photo was taken by Cody's camera at a certain time, which contradicts his testimony about not being able to take it. But again, the evidences don't mention such a photo.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me re-read the problem. The user wants one pair where evidence and testimony contradict each other. The answer must be in JSON.

Wait, looking back at the previous example, the contradiction was between a testimony stating "never touched the murder weapon" and evidence showing fingerprints on it. Similarly, here, perhaps Cody's testimony about erasing photos (Testimony 5) contradicts an evidence that shows the photos still exist. But if the camera (Evidence 15) is the evidence, but the description doesn't mention any photos, that's not helpful.

Wait, another angle: Evidence 15 is Cody's Camera. Testimony 5 says he erased the photos. But if the camera's memory still contains the photos (even if he tried to erase them), then that would contradict. But the evidence description doesn't state that. Unless the camera being digital means that deleted photos can be recovered, but that's technical and not mentioned.

Alternatively, maybe the camera's existence as a new digital camera (Evidence 15) suggests that it's possible he took photos, but he claims he erased them. But without the evidence showing the photos exist, it's not a direct contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere. Let me check other evidences. Evidence 16: Steak Plate with traces of sleeping pills and a bone. Maybe someone was drugged. If a testimony claims they weren't, but that's not from Cody.

Wait, the testimonies are all from Cody, so the contradiction must involve his testimony and an evidence.

Alternatively, maybe Testimony 1: "The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain." If this refers to the show's episode, but the Script (Evidence 10) for Episode 13 might not include that scene, contradicting his statement. But I don't know the script's content. The evidence description only says it's the script for Episode 13.

Alternatively, the director's van (Evidence 18) was used to drive Vasquez to Studio One after a meeting. Not sure how that connects.

Wait, maybe the murder weapon is the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6), which had a break mended with duct tape. If someone's testimony says the spear was intact, but the evidence shows it was broken. But the testimonies from Cody don't mention the spear.

Hmm. This is challenging. Let me recap:

Cody's testimonies are about trying to take photos, failing, erasing them. The relevant evidence would be his camera. If the camera's evidence (15) somehow contradicts his testimony, but how?

Testimony 3: lens wouldn't open, missed the shot.

Testimony 5: took a few shots, erased them.

These two are conflicting, but it's between testimonies, not evidence. The question wants evidence vs testimony.

Wait, perhaps Evidence 15: Cody's Camera. The description says he's still learning to use it. If he claims he took some shots (Testimony 5), but the camera's state (being new and him not knowing how to use it) suggests he couldn't have taken them. But that's a stretch. Or maybe the camera's model has no erase function, making Testimony 5 impossible. But that's not indicated.

Alternatively, maybe the time stamps. Let's see:

The murder was at 2:30 PM. The path was blocked from 2:15 PM. If Cody was taking photos after 2:15 PM, but the path was blocked, he couldn't have been there. But his testimony doesn't specify the time. Unless Evidence 5's photo (taken at 2:00 PM) shows something that Cody's testimony refers to. But again, not directly.

Wait, Evidence 5 is a photo of Powers at 2:00 PM, dragging a leg. If Cody's testimony refers to taking a photo of the Steel Samurai (Testimony 1), perhaps the actual events in the studio were different. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the Steel Samurai Card (Evidence 12) and URP Card (Evidence 13) are collectibles. If Cody, being a fan, had one, but that's unrelated.

Wait, maybe the fact that the path was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) from 2:15 PM means that Cody couldn't have been at the scene to take photos after that time. If his testimony about taking photos refers to a time after 2:15 PM, but the path was blocked, then that's a contradiction. But the testimonies don't mention the time they occurred. Unless the photos he tried to take were during the time the path was blocked.

Alternatively, Testimony 1 and 2: he tried to take a picture of the Steel Samurai escaping. If that event happened after 2:15 PM when the path was blocked, then he couldn't have been there to take the photo. But without knowing when the event in the show happened, it's hard to say.

This is really tricky. Maybe I'm missing something obvious. Let's look again at the testimonies and evidences.

Cody's testimonies:

0: "Yeah, you're right, pops." – not helpful.

1: "The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain." – describing a scene.

2: "So I held up my camera to take a picture!"

3: "But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it."

4: "Th-that's all that happened. Yup."

5: "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em."

So Testimony 3 says he missed the shot because the lens didn't open. Testimony 5 says he took shots but erased them. These are conflicting. But how does evidence come into play?

If there's an evidence that shows he did take a photo, contradicting Testimony 3, or that he couldn't have erased them, contradicting Testimony 5.

Looking at Evidence 15: Cody's Camera. If the camera's data shows that photos were taken and not erased, that would contradict Testimony 5. But the evidence description doesn't mention any photos. It just says he carries it.

Alternatively, maybe the camera's existence implies he could take photos, but he claims he didn't. But that's not a direct contradiction.

Wait, perhaps Evidence 15's existence as a digital camera (which typically saves photos even if you think you erased them) contradicts Testimony 5 where he says he erased them. But the problem is the evidence doesn't state that any photos were recovered. This is speculative.

Alternatively, the "Path to Glory" (Evidence 14) contains photos of every victory scene. If Cody's testimony about the Steel Samurai escaping is part of a victory scene, but the "Path to Glory" doesn't include it, that could contradict. But there's no info on the content of Evidence 14.

I'm struggling here. Maybe the answer is Evidence 5 (Powers' Photo) and Testimony 5 (Cody says he erased the photos). If the photo in Evidence 5 was taken by Cody's camera, then despite him saying he erased them, the photo exists. But Evidence 5 is labeled as Powers'(?) Photo, which might not be taken by Cody. The description says it's "taken at the gate", possibly by a security camera. So that's unrelated to Cody's camera.

Alternatively, if Cody's camera (Evidence 15) is the same as the one that took Evidence 5, but there's no indication of that. The user would have to assume, but it's not stated.

Hmm. Maybe I need to look elsewhere. Let's check the other evidences. Evidence 7: Empty Bottle → Sleeping Pill Bottle with Jack's fingerprints. If someone's testimony says they didn't touch it, but the evidence shows prints. But the testimonies are all from Cody.

Wait, the murder weapon is the Samurai Spear. If any testimony mentions not touching it, but there's evidence of prints. But testimonies here don't mention that.

Alternatively, the Security Lady's claim that she saw Powers heading to the scene. The photo (Evidence 5) shows Powers at 2:00 PM, and the path was blocked at 2:15 PM. If the murder happened at 2:30 PM, Powers couldn't have accessed the scene after 2:15 PM. So if the Security Lady saw him after 2:15 PM, that's a contradiction. But again, the testimonies here are from Cody, not the Security Lady.

Back to Cody. His Testimony 5 says he erased the photos. If Evidence 15 (his camera) has a photo that he claims to have erased, that's a contradiction. But the evidence doesn't mention any photos. Unless the camera's presence implies that the photos are still there. But without explicit info, this is risky.

Alternatively, maybe the Cardkey (Evidence 4) allows access to Studio One. If Cody's testimony implies he was somewhere he couldn't be without the cardkey, but there's no info on that.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The most likely answer is Testimony 5 (Cody says he erased the photos) and Evidence 15 (Cody's Camera), if the camera has photos he supposedly erased. But since the evidence doesn't mention photos, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps Testimony 2 and 3: he tried to take a picture, but the lens didn't open. If the camera's description (Evidence 15) says it's a new digital camera, perhaps the lens mechanism is automatic and always opens, contradicting his claim. But that's an assumption about the camera's functionality.

Alternatively, the camera's model might have a feature where the lens opens automatically when powered on, making Testimony 3's claim impossible. But again, this is speculative.

Given that the previous example had a direct contradiction between a testimony denying touching the weapon and evidence showing fingerprints, perhaps here, a similar logic applies. The only possible contradiction I can see is Cody's Testimony 3 (lens wouldn't open) or 5 (erased photos) conflicting with Evidence 15 (his camera), but how?

Wait, if the camera's existence as a new model that doesn't have a lens that jams (as per Testimony 3), but that's not stated in the evidence. Alternatively, if the camera's manual (not mentioned) says the lens always opens, but again, not stated.

Alternatively, maybe the camera's presence as his own camera implies that he took photos, which contradicts Testimony 3. But Testimony 3 says he missed the shot, not that he didn't take any.

This is really tough. I might have to go with the best possible guess based on the structure of the previous example. If there's a testimony denying something that evidence directly shows.

Looking at Testimony 5: "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em." If there's an evidence that shows the photos exist despite him erasing them, that would contradict. But the evidence doesn't mention this. Unless there's another evidence. Wait, maybe Evidence 15's description says he's learning to use it. If he erased the photos improperly, they might still be recoverable, but the evidence doesn't state that. 

Alternatively, maybe the camera has a photo timestamped at the time of the murder, which he claims to have missed. For example, if the camera's metadata shows a photo taken at 2:30 PM, but he says he missed it. But the evidence doesn't mention this.

In the absence of clear info, perhaps the intended answer is Testimony 5 (erased photos) and Evidence 15 (his camera), assuming that the camera still has the photos. But the evidence description doesn't state that. Alternatively, maybe Testimony 3 (lens didn't open) and Evidence 15 (camera works fine). But again, no info.

Wait, the previous answer in the example was straightforward: testimony says didn't touch murder weapon, evidence shows prints. Here, maybe a similar case. Let me check the evidences again.

Evidence 6: Samurai Spear, the murder weapon. If any testimony denies touching it, but there's prints. But testimonies are from Cody, who is a witness, not the defendant.

Evidence 7: Sleeping pills with Jack's fingerprints. If a testimony said he didn't touch it, but that's not relevant here.

Evidence 5: Photo of Powers at 2:00 PM. If a testimony claims Powers was elsewhere, but the photo shows him there. But testimonies are from Cody, not Powers.

Wait, the Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene. If the photo (Evidence 5) shows him at 2:00 PM at the gate, then if the Security Lady's testimony was that she saw him later, after 2:15 PM when the path was blocked, that's a contradiction. But the testimonies provided are from Cody, not the Security Lady. So this is not applicable.

Given all that, I'm stuck. The most plausible answer, even if not perfect, is Cody's Testimony 5 (erased photos) and Evidence 15 (his camera), assuming that the camera's existence contradicts his ability to erase them, but this is a stretch. Alternatively, maybe Evidence 5 (photo of Powers) contradicts a testimony, but it's not clear.

Wait, let's think again. If Cody says he tried to take a photo but the lens didn't open (Testimony 3), but there's a photo (maybe from his camera) that was taken at that time, that would contradict. If Evidence 15's camera has that photo, but the evidence doesn't say so. Alternatively, if another evidence like Evidence 5 is that photo, but Evidence 5 is of Powers, not related to Cody's attempted photo.

Given the time constraints and the need to provide an answer, I'll go with Testimony 5 (Cody erased the photos) and Evidence 15 (his camera), assuming that the camera's data shows the photos still exist, even though the evidence description doesn't explicitly state it. It's a stretch, but based on the previous example's logic.

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 5}

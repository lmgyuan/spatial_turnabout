Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look through all the evidence and testimonies to find a contradiction. The user wants only one pair where evidence and testimony contradict each other.

Starting with the testimonies. The testimonies are from Gumshoe, the detective. Let's go through each one:

Testimony 0: Crime reported at 2:25 PM by a scary old man. That's probably Victor Kudo or someone else. Not sure yet.

Testimony 1: Maggey passed out from shock. That's her reaction, not directly related to evidence yet.

Testimony 2: Victim had no ID. Then Testimony 3 says they figured out who he was quickly. Evidence 10 (Glen's Autopsy Report) says time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. The crime was reported at 2:25 PM, which is within the time of death window. Not a contradiction here.

Testimony 4: When Maggey was searched, they found the lottery ticket and poison. Evidence 14 is the lottery ticket found on Maggey, and Evidence 16 is the potassium cyanide in her apron. But wait, Evidence 4 (Job Listings) says it was thrown away by the old man. Not sure.

Wait, Testimony 5: "And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene." But looking at the evidence, Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony where he says he broke the vase. The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows two vases on each table, both intact. Wait, Victor's Testimony 18 says he broke the vase at his seat, but the photo shows both vases intact. That's a contradiction. Because if Victor broke the vase, the photo should show a broken one. But according to the Crime Photo, both vases are intact. So Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony) contradicts Evidence 12 (Crime Photo). Wait, but Testimony 18 is part of the evidence, not the testimonies listed here. Wait, the testimonies given here are from Gumshoe (Testimony 0-5). So maybe looking at other evidence.

Wait, the user provided Testimonies 0-5, all from Gumshoe. So Testimony 5 says "nothing else missing from the crime scene." But looking at Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) which is part of the evidence, not the testimonies. Wait, no, Testimony 18 is part of the evidence list. The Testimonies to consider are 0-5, all by Gumshoe. So let's focus on those.

Testimony 5: "nothing else missing from the crime scene." But looking at the Crime Photo (Evidence 12), there's a coffee cup knocked over, stained cloth, papers. The photo shows that the victim's table has a coffee cup, which is Evidence 13. The Crime Photo's description says there's a knocked-over coffee cup, which is present. But the problem might be elsewhere.

Wait, in Evidence 6: Small Bottle found in the kitchen, which is the victim's ear medicine with unidentified fingerprints. But Testimony 5 says "nothing else missing". However, the Small Bottle was found in the kitchen, which is part of the crime scene. So maybe that's not missing. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket found on Maggey. But the victim's name is Glen Elg, so the lottery ticket was his, but found on Maggey. If the ticket was supposed to be on the victim, then it's missing from the crime scene. But Testimony 5 says "nothing else missing". But the ticket was found on Maggey, implying it was taken from the scene. So that could be a contradiction. Because if the ticket was part of the victim's belongings, then it's missing from the crime scene, but Testimony 5 says nothing was missing. Therefore, Testimony 5 contradicts Evidence 14. 

Wait, but Testimony 4 states that the lottery ticket was found on Maggey during the search. So if the lottery ticket was supposed to be on the victim, then its absence from the crime scene would mean something was missing, but Testimony 5 says nothing was missing. Therefore, Testimony 5 ("nothing else missing") is contradicted by the fact that the lottery ticket was found on Maggey, implying it was taken from the scene. Therefore, the lottery ticket's absence from the crime scene (since it's on Maggey) would mean something was missing, contradicting Testimony 5. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Gumshoe's statement that nothing was missing) and Evidence 14 (the lottery ticket found on Maggey, which should have been at the scene if the victim had it). 

Alternatively, the victim's autopsy report (Evidence 10) says time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. The crime was reported at 2:25 PM (Testimony 0). The victim had a lottery ticket (Evidence 14), which is a winning ticket for half a million. If the victim had it on him, and then it's found on Maggey, that suggests it was taken from the victim. Therefore, the ticket was missing from the crime scene, but Testimony 5 says nothing was missing. Hence, contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 14.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 16 (Potassium Cyanide found in Maggey's apron) and Testimony 5. If the poison was in her apron, which is part of the crime scene, then maybe not missing. But the poison was in her pocket, so it was there, so not missing. Hmm. 

Another angle: Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup) has Maggey's fingerprints. Evidence 16 (Poison in her apron). Testimony 4 says they found the poison and the lottery ticket on Maggey. So that's consistent. 

Wait, the key contradiction is Testimony 5: "nothing else missing from the crime scene." But the lottery ticket was found on Maggey, implying it was taken from the victim, so the crime scene is missing the ticket. Therefore, Testimony 5 is contradicted by Evidence 14. That's a valid contradiction. So the answer would be {"evidence": 14, "testimony":5}

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 5 states that "there was nothing else missing from the crime scene." However, Evidence 14 (Victim's Lottery Ticket) was found on Maggey during her search. Since the ticket belonged to the victim, its absence from the crime scene implies something was missing, contradicting Testimony 5.
{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. They provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. My task is to analyze these and find one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, I'll start by reviewing the testimonies given. The testimonies are from Kudo (Victor Kudo), and they all seem to relate to the incident at Trés Bien. Let me list out the testimonies again to get a clear picture:

Testimony 0: "The young man was reading the sports paper."
Testimony 1: "The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!"
Testimony 2: "There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there."
Testimony 3: "The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed."
Testimony 4: Points out Maggey as the serving girl.
Testimony 5: Mentions a ribbon in her hair and loose apron straps.
Testimony 6: Says nothing caught his interest when he saw her from the front.

Now, looking at the evidences, especially those related to the murder. The victim, Glen Elg, died of potassium cyanide poisoning (Evidence 10: Autopsy Report). The poison was in the coffee cup (Evidence 13), which has Maggey's fingerprints. Additionally, the potassium cyanide was found in Maggey's apron pocket (Evidence 16). Also, there's the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) showing the scene with two tables separated by a folding screen, and the victim's coffee cup with a lip stain on the front and a floral handle to the right.

Now, let's cross-reference the testimonies with the evidences. Testimony 2 claims that Kudo saw the serving girl (Maggey) put white powder into the javaccino. However, Evidence 13 describes the coffee cup as having a lip stain on the front and a floral handle to the right. If the handle is on the right, that suggests the cup was designed for a right-handed person. But if the server (Maggey) was adding something to the cup, she might have had to hold it in a certain way. Also, Evidence 12's crime photo shows the coffee cup was on the victim's table, which was behind a folding screen. Testimony 0 says the young man (victim) was reading the sports paper. The sports paper (Evidence 3) has a doodle mentioning 'MC Bomber' and a date of December 3rd, which is the day of the incident. 

Wait, but the key contradiction here might be regarding the visibility of the act. Testimony 2 states that Kudo saw Maggey "very conspicuously" put white powder into the drink. However, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows that the two tables are separated by a folding screen. The victim's table is the one where he collapsed, and the other table (closer to the camera) is empty. If Kudo was sitting at a different table, perhaps behind the folding screen, could he actually see the serving girl adding the powder? The photo shows that the tables are separated by a screen, which might block the view from Kudo's position. Therefore, if Kudo claims to have seen her put the powder in, but the screen would obstruct that view, that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at the coffee cup's description: Evidence 13 says the cup has a lip stain on the front and a floral handle to the right. If the handle is on the right, the cup is oriented for a right-handed person. The lip stain on the front would mean the drink was sipped from the front. However, if the server (Maggey) added the poison, she might have had to rotate the cup to access it, potentially altering the handle's position relative to the victim. But this might be a stretch.

Another angle: Evidence 16 states that the potassium cyanide was found in Maggey's apron pocket with her fingerprints. However, Testimony 2 claims she conspicuously added the powder. If she used the cyanide from her apron, her fingerprints would be on the bottle, which they are. But maybe the contradiction is in the visibility. If the folding screen was present, as per Evidence 12's photo, then Kudo's testimony about seeing her add the powder might not be possible if the screen blocked his view.

Yes, that seems more solid. The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the two tables separated by a folding screen. The victim's table is the one where he collapsed, which is behind the screen. If Kudo was at the other table (the empty one closer to the camera), then the screen would block his view of the victim's table. Therefore, Testimony 2, where Kudo claims to have seen Maggey put the powder in the drink, contradicts the physical layout shown in Evidence 12. He couldn't have seen it if the screen was in the way.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 2 states Victor Kudo saw Maggey "conspicuously" put white powder into the victim's drink. However, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows the victim's table and the witness's table were separated by a folding screen. The screen would obstruct Kudo's view of the victim's table, making it impossible to witness the act as described. This creates a contradiction between the testimony and the physical layout evidence.
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 2}
Alright, let's dive into this. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. There's a lot here, so I need to go step by step.

First, let's look at the testimonies. Testimony 0 to 4 are all from Kudo. Let's summarize them:

Testimony 0: The victim (Glen Elg) was a young type with broken glasses.
Testimony 1: He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling it.
Testimony 2: The young man was listening to the wireless (radio).
Testimony 3: The serving girl (Maggey) brought over the javaccino.
Testimony 4: The victim picked up the cup with his free hand (since the other had the newspaper) and took a sip.

Now, looking at the evidence. Let's check each one for contradictions with these testimonies.

Evidence 13: Coffee Cup. It contains cyanide, has the victim and Maggey's prints. The description mentions a lip stain on the front and a floral handle on the right. If the victim picked up the cup with his free hand (which would be the left hand if the right was holding the newspaper), then drinking from it would leave a lip stain on the side he sipped from. But the cup's lip stain is on the front. Wait, maybe the handle's position matters. If the handle is on the right, and he used his left hand to pick it up, the handle would be on his right, but he'd have to turn the cup to sip, which might align the lip stain to the front. Hmm, not sure if that's a contradiction yet.

Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony. He says he broke the vase at his seat. But in the Crime Photo (Evidence 12), there are intact vases on both tables. That's a contradiction. If Victor broke his vase, the photo should show a broken one. But the photo says both vases are intact. So Testimony 18 (Victor's own testimony) contradicts Evidence 12. Wait, but Testimony 18 is labeled as an evidence, not a testimony. Wait, looking back: Testimony 18 is part of the evidence list. Wait, the user listed Testimonies 0-4, and the Evidences go up to 27. So Evidence 18 is "Victor's Testimony" which says he broke the vase. But Evidence 12, the Crime Photo, shows both vases intact. That's a direct contradiction. So Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) contradicts Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony). But wait, the question asks for a pair where evidence and testimony contradict. Testimony 18 is actually an evidence, not a testimony. Wait, no. Let me check again.

Looking at the Testimonies section: Testimony 0 to Testimony 4 are under Testimonies. Then, in the Evidences, Evidence 18 is named "Victor's Testimony" which is a description: "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." So Evidence 18 is Victor's testimony, but presented as evidence. The user's question asks for contradictions between evidence and testimony. So perhaps one of the testimonies (0-4) contradicts an evidence. Let me check again.

Testimonies 0-4 are all from Kudo, describing the victim's actions. Let's see if any of those testimonies contradict any evidence.

Looking at Testimony 4: The victim picked up the cup with his free hand (left, if right was holding the newspaper) and took a sip. The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has a lip stain on the front and a handle on the right. If he used his left hand, the handle would be on the right side of the cup from his perspective. To drink, he might turn the cup so the handle is on his left, causing the lip stain to be on the opposite side. But the description says the lip stain is on the front. Maybe the handle's position implies the cup was placed in a certain orientation. If the handle is to the right, and the lip stain is on the front, perhaps the cup was placed with the handle facing right, and the victim sipped from the front. But if he used his left hand, maybe he rotated it. Not sure if that's a contradiction.

Another angle: Evidence 10 (Glen's Autopsy Report) says time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. Evidence 19 (Millionaire Radio Flyer) mentions the radio show at 1:30 PM every Monday. Testimony 2 says the victim was listening to the wireless (radio). If the incident happened on Dec 3rd, which is a Monday (from Evidence 3: Sports Paper dated Dec 3rd), then the radio show was at 1:30 PM. If the victim was listening to it, that aligns with the time of death. Not a contradiction here.

Looking at Testimony 18 (as part of Evidence) saying he broke the vase, but the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows intact vases. So Evidence 12 contradicts Evidence 18, but the user is asking for a contradiction between evidence and testimony. Since Testimony 18 is actually categorized as Evidence, maybe we need to find a testimony (0-4) that contradicts an evidence.

Wait, Testimony 3 from Kudo says Maggey brought the javaccino. Evidence 13: Coffee Cup is described as containing potassium cyanide, but Maggey's fingerprints are on it. That's consistent because she served it. But Evidence 16 (Potassium Cyanide) has Maggey's prints on the poison found in her apron. That might suggest she handled the poison, which could be consistent with her being the killer. But how does that contradict testimony?

Alternatively, Testimony 4 says the victim took a sip with his free hand. Evidence 13's Coffee Cup has lip stain on the front. If he sipped from the front, that's okay, but maybe the handle's position. If the handle is on the right, and he used his left hand, he might have to turn the cup, making the lip stain not on the front. Wait, maybe the handle's position relative to the lip stain indicates which hand was used. If the handle is on the right, a right-handed person would hold it with the right hand, bringing the cup to their mouth with the handle on their right, causing the lip stain to be on the left side. But the cup's lip stain is on the front. Hmm. This might not be a direct contradiction, but maybe there's something here.

Alternatively, Evidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket found on Maggey. Testimonies don't mention that, but that's not a direct contradiction.

Wait, maybe Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony, listed as Evidence 18) says he broke the vase. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows both vases intact. So Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) contradicts Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony). However, the user's question is asking for a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony (from the testimonies list, which are 0-4). So maybe I need to check if any of the testimonies 0-4 contradict an evidence.

Looking at Testimony 2: Kudo says the young man was listening to the wireless (radio). Evidence 19: Millionaire Radio Flyer is a show at 1:30 PM. If the time of death is between 1:30-2:30 PM, and the victim was listening to the radio at the time, which started at 1:30, that's consistent. Not a contradiction.

Testimony 1: The victim had a newspaper in his right hand. Evidence 3: Sports Paper from Dec 3rd (day of incident) has a doodle. If the victim was holding the newspaper, that's consistent. Evidence 3 is the same newspaper, so no contradiction.

Testimony 0: Victim had broken glasses. But looking through evidences, no mention of broken glasses. So no contradiction here.

Wait, Evidence 17: Victim's Prescription Bag is empty. If he needed ear medicine (Evidence 6: Small Bottle is ear medicine), maybe that's related. But not a contradiction with testimonies.

Another angle: Testimony 4 says the victim used his free hand (left) to pick up the cup. Evidence 13's Coffee Cup has a floral handle on the right. If the handle is on the right, a right-handed person would typically hold it with the right hand, but the victim's right hand was holding the newspaper (Testimony 1), so he used his left. But the handle is on the right side of the cup. If he picks it up with his left hand, the handle would be on his right, making it awkward to drink. The lip stain is on the front. Maybe this setup is possible, but is there a contradiction? If the handle's position is such that the cup is designed to be held with the right hand, but he used his left, maybe the lip stain would be on the opposite side. But the evidence says the lip stain is on the front. If he turned the cup to drink with his left hand, the front (as per the cup's orientation when placed) might still have the lip stain. Not sure. This might be a stretch, but maybe this is the contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 13 says the coffee cup has Maggey's fingerprints. If she served it, that's expected. But Evidence 16 says the poison was in her apron with her prints, implying she handled it. But Testimony 3 says she brought the drink, which would explain her prints on the cup. No contradiction there.

Wait, another thought: The autopsy report (Evidence 10) says death by potassium cyanide poisoning. The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has the poison. Testimony 4 says the victim sipped from the cup, which would mean he ingested the poison. That's consistent.

Wait, going back to the vase. Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows both tables have intact vases. But Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony as an evidence) says he broke the vase. This is a contradiction. However, Evidence 18 is part of the evidence list, not the testimonies list. The user's question asks for a pair where evidence and testimony contradict. So if a testimony (from 0-4) contradicts an evidence, that's the answer.

Wait, the Testimonies are from Kudo (Victor Kudo?), but looking at the characters, Victor Kudo is Character 7. Testimonies 0-4 are all from Kudo. Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony (as an evidence), which is from Victor Kudo. So in the testimonies section, Kudo's testimonies are 0-4, but Evidence 18 is his testimony presented as evidence. Wait, maybe this is a mistake. Let me check:

Testimonies section lists Testimony 0-4, each with a Person. For example, Testimony 0's person is Kudo. Similarly for 1-4. Then in Evidences, Evidence 18 is "Victor's Testimony" which is his statement about breaking the vase. So the user might be considering Testimony 18 as part of the evidence, but the actual testimonies from Kudo are 0-4. So the contradiction is between Evidence 12 (Crime Photo showing intact vases) and Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony saying he broke a vase). But since the user's question is about testimonies (0-4) and evidences, perhaps the answer is that Evidence 12 contradicts Testimony 18, but Testimony 18 is part of the evidence, not the testimonies list. Therefore, the actual contradiction must be between one of the testimonies (0-4) and an evidence.

Wait, let me check again. The user lists Testimonies as Testimony 0 to Testimony 4, each with a Person. Then, the Evidences list includes Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony. So in this case, the testimony in Evidence 18 is separate from the Testimonies list. Therefore, the user wants us to compare the Testimonies (0-4) with the Evidences (0-27) to find a contradiction.

So, re-examizing:

Testimony 4: The victim picked up the cup with his free hand (left) and took a sip.

Evidence 13: Coffee Cup has a lip stain on the front and a handle on the right. If the handle is on the right, and he used his left hand, perhaps the cup's orientation would be different. When holding with the left hand, the handle would be on the right side of the cup, so to drink, he might turn the cup towards his mouth, causing the lip stain to be on the side opposite the handle. But the evidence says the lip stain is on the front. If the front is relative to the cup's position on the table, then maybe the handle is on the right, and the lip stain is on the front, meaning the victim drank from the front without rotating the cup. But if he used his left hand, that's possible. Not sure if this is a contradiction.

Alternatively, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the victim's table with a coffee cup knocked over. The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) is described as having the coffee spilled (knocked over) and the table cloth stained. Testimony 4 says the victim took a sip, implying he drank from it, which would mean the cup was upright when he drank, then knocked over. But the Crime Photo shows the cup knocked over. That seems consistent—he drank, then the cup was knocked over when he collapsed. So no contradiction here.

Wait, Evidence 12's Crime Photo description: "A coffee cup is knocked over and the table cloth is stained by coffee." Testimony 4 says he took a sip, which could be before the cup was knocked over. That's plausible.

Another angle: Evidence 16 (Potassium Cyanide in Maggey's apron) has her fingerprints. Testimony 3 says she brought the javaccino, which would explain her prints on the cup. But if the poison was in her apron, that suggests she had access to it. However, no direct contradiction here.

Wait, let's think about the vase again. Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) says he broke the vase. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) taken at the scene shows both vases intact. So if Victor broke his vase, the photo should show a broken vase. Therefore, Evidence 12 contradicts Evidence 18. However, the user's question is about contradictions between evidence and testimony, where testimonies are Testimony 0-4. But Evidence 18 is categorized as an evidence, not a testimony. Therefore, maybe the answer is between Evidence 12 (intact vases) and Testimony 18 (Victor's testimony), but since Testimony 18 is evidence, not part of the testimonies list, perhaps there's another contradiction.

Wait, looking back at the Testimonies list, all are from Kudo (Person: Kudo). Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony, which is Victor Kudo's own statement. But in the Testimonies list, Kudo's testimonies are 0-4. So is Evidence 18 a separate testimony from Victor Kudo, outside of 0-4? That's possible. If so, then the contradiction is between Evidence 12 (intact vases) and Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony about breaking the vase). But the user is asking for a testimony (from the Testimonies list 0-4) and evidence contradiction. Therefore, I need to check if any of the Testimonies 0-4 contradict any evidence.

Wait, Testimony 18 is not part of the Testimonies list; it's an Evidence. Therefore, perhaps the answer is Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 18 (which is actually Evidence 18). But since the user wants a testimony from the Testimonies list (0-4), this might not be the correct pair.

Alternatively, maybe Testimony 4 (victim sipping with free hand) and Evidence 13's description of the cup's handle and lip stain. If the victim used his left hand (free hand) to pick up the cup with the handle on the right, the lip stain's position might not match. For example, if the handle is on the right side of the cup, when held with the left hand, the drinker would have to rotate the cup, causing the lip stain to be on the left side from the cup's perspective, but the evidence says it's on the front. This could be a contradiction if the front is defined relative to the table's orientation. If the handle is on the right (from the perspective of someone facing the cup), and the lip stain is on the front (the side facing away from the handle), then if the victim used his left hand, he'd have to turn the cup towards him, making the lip stain on the back. But Evidence 13 says the lip stain is on the front. That would be a contradiction. So the testimony that he used his free hand (left) contradicts the evidence that the lip stain is on the front (suggesting he used his right hand). 

Therefore, Testimony 4 (using free hand, left) and Evidence 13 (lip stain front, handle right) contradict each other. Because if he used his left hand, the handle is on his right, so to drink, he'd turn the cup so the front (as per the cup's original position) would now be facing his mouth, leaving the lip stain on the opposite side. But the evidence says the lip stain is on the front, implying he used his right hand. But according to Testimony 1, the victim was holding a newspaper in his right hand, so he had to use his left. Hence, contradiction between Testimony 4 and Evidence 13.

That's a possible answer. Let me confirm:

Testimony 4: Victim picked up the cup with his free hand (left) and sipped.

Evidence 13: Cup has handle on the right and lip stain on the front. If the handle is on the right, using the left hand would require turning the cup, causing the lip stain to be on the left side (from the cup's original position). But the evidence says front, so contradiction.

{"evidence": 13, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's tackle this. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to look through all the evidence and testimonies provided and see where there's a direct conflict.

First, let me list out the key points from the evidence and testimonies. The testimonies are given by Kudo (Victor Kudo) as per the person listed. The evidences are various items from the crime scene and related locations.

Looking at the testimonies from Kudo:

Testimony 0: He's unsure about something, but not specific.
Testimony 1: He says the victim slumped over after sipping javaccino.
Testimony 2: He mentions a clumsy idiot (maybe himself?) upsetting a vase.
Testimony 3: The vase broke, soaking the table cloth.
Testimony 4: He's challenging someone, maybe about the overturned vase.

Now, looking at the evidences. Let's check for anything related to the vase or the coffee cup.

Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony: "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." Wait, that's interesting. Wait, but in the testimonies provided here, Testimony 2 and 3 from Kudo mention the vase being knocked over and broken, leading to a soaked tablecloth. However, Evidence 18 is a written testimony from Victor Kudo where he admits to breaking the vase at his seat. But in the testimonies listed under Testimonies (Testimony 2 and 3), Kudo says that "the clumsy idiot" (maybe referring to himself?) knocked over the vase. But if Victor Kudo is the one who broke the vase, then in the testimonies he might be referring to himself as the clumsy one. However, perhaps there's a contradiction in the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) which shows the crime scene with two dining tables separated by a folding screen. The photo description says there's an intact vase on each table. Wait, that's a problem. If Victor broke the vase during the incident, then in the Crime Photo taken at the scene, one of the vases should be broken. But according to Evidence 12's description, both vases are intact. That contradicts Testimony 2 and 3 (and Evidence 18) where the vase was broken. So the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows intact vases, but the testimonies and Evidence 18 say that a vase was broken. Therefore, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) contradicts Testimony 2 (where Kudo says the vase was knocked over and broken) and Evidence 18. But since the question asks for one pair, which evidence and testimony contradict each other.

Wait, Evidence 18 is actually a testimony itself, labeled as Victor's Testimony. But in the Testimonies section, Testimony 2 and 3 are given as statements by Kudo. So Evidence 18 is a separate testimony, perhaps presented as physical evidence. But the user's instruction says to compare the testimonies (Testimony 0-4) with the evidences (Evidence 0-27). Therefore, if in the testimonies, Kudo says he broke the vase (as in Testimony 2 and 3), but the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows both vases intact, that's a contradiction. So the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (or 3) and Evidence 12. Let me confirm.

Testimony 2: "Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over."
Testimony 3: "It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!"
So according to Kudo's testimonies, a vase was knocked over and broke, leading to the tablecloth being soaked. However, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) description says "There is an intact vase on each table." This directly contradicts the testimonies. Therefore, the evidence (12) and testimony (2 or 3) conflict. The user asks to output one pair. Since Testimony 2 mentions the vase being knocked over, which would result in it being broken, but the photo shows both intact, the contradiction is between Evidence 12 and Testimony 2.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 2 from Kudo states that the vase was knocked over and broken, which would result in a broken vase at the crime scene. However, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) describes both vases as intact. This directly contradicts the testimony, as the photo shows no broken vases.
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 2}

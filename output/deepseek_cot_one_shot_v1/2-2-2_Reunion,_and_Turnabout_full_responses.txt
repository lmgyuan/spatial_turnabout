Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So first, I need to go through all the evidence and testimonies provided and look for inconsistencies.

Looking at the characters, the main ones involved in the testimonies here are Detective Gumshoe. The testimonies are from him, specifically Testimony 0 to 3. Let's check each one against the evidence.

Testimony 1: Gumshoe states, "This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime." The defendant here is Maya Fey, right? The evidence related to Maya's costume is Evidence 11: Maya's Costume. The description says there are blood splatters and a bullet hole in the sleeve. But wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 8) says Dr. Grey was stabbed first, then shot. The pistol (Evidence 9) is the murder weapon with Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. The knife (Evidence 10) has Maya's fingerprints too. 

Now, Testimony 3 from Gumshoe claims, "The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back." But according to the autopsy, Dr. Grey was stabbed and then shot. If he was stabbed first, maybe he could have fought back after being stabbed but before being shot. However, the testimony says the victim wasn't fighting back. But I'm not sure if that's a direct contradiction here.

Wait, let's look at the blood on Maya's costume. Evidence 11 mentions blood splatters and a bullet hole in the sleeve. If Maya was wearing the costume during the murder, the blood could be from the stabbing. But the pistol (Evidence 9) has two shots fired and has Maya's fingerprints. But wait, the autopsy says he was shot once in the forehead. The pistol had two shots fired. Maybe that's a discrepancy? But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says the victim wasn't fighting back. If Dr. Grey was stabbed first, he might have been incapacitated, hence not fighting back when shot. That might not contradict. 

Wait, let's check Evidence 8 again. The autopsy says he was stabbed in the chest first, then shot. The presence of gunpowder residue around the bullet hole suggests the shot was at point-blank range. So the stabbing would have come first. If Maya did both, then maybe she stabbed him (incapacitating him) and then shot him while he couldn't fight back. But the testimony says the victim wasn't fighting back. That might align. So maybe not a contradiction there.

Another angle: Testimony 1 from Gumshoe says Maya was wearing the costume during the crime, and the costume has a bullet hole in the sleeve (Evidence 11). But the pistol (Evidence 9) was used to shoot Dr. Grey. If Maya was holding the gun, the bullet hole in her sleeve might suggest she was shot at. But according to the scenario, Maya is the defendant, accused of murder. If the bullet hole is in her sleeve, maybe she was shot at, which could imply someone else fired the gun. But the pistol has Maya's fingerprints. Hmm.

Wait, the pistol's description says it's the murder weapon, two shots fired, and bears Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. But the autopsy says he was shot once. So two shots were fired, but only one hit him. The other shot could have gone into Maya's sleeve. That would explain the bullet hole in her costume. But if Maya was holding the gun, how did the bullet hole get in her own sleeve? Maybe she was struggling with someone else. But if her fingerprints are on the gun, she could have fired it. But if there's a bullet hole in her sleeve, perhaps she was shot at, which would imply another person fired. But then, the gun has her prints, so maybe she fired it. This could be a contradiction between the testimony that she was wearing the costume with a bullet hole (implying she was shot at) and the evidence that the gun with her prints was used. Alternatively, maybe the presence of her fingerprints on the gun supports her involvement, but the bullet hole in her sleeve suggests she was a victim of a shot, which could mean someone else fired. But I'm not sure if that's a direct contradiction.

Wait, let's look at Evidence 11 again: the robe has a bullet hole in the sleeve. If Maya was wearing it when the shot was fired, and the pistol was used by her, then the bullet hole could be from the second shot (since two were fired). But why would there be a bullet hole in her own sleeve? Maybe she was shot by someone else. But the gun has her fingerprints. Alternatively, if she fired the gun and the bullet went through her own sleeve, that's possible but unlikely. This could be a contradiction between the testimony that she was wearing the costume (which has a bullet hole) and the evidence that the gun with her prints was used. But maybe the key contradiction is elsewhere.

Looking at Testimony 3 again: "The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back." If the victim was stabbed first, then shot, he might have been unable to fight back after the stabbing. But the presence of two shots fired (Evidence 9) but only one bullet wound (Evidence 8) suggests another shot was fired. Maybe that shot hit Maya's sleeve. If the defendant (Maya) was the one who fired both shots, but the victim was already incapacitated by the stabbing, then the testimony could be accurate. However, the bullet hole in her sleeve might suggest that she was in the line of fire, implying someone else shot at her, which would contradict her being the sole perpetrator. But how does this relate to the testimonies?

Alternatively, let's check Evidence 18: Ini's driver's license photo, which is Director Hotti's treasured possession. But Ini's sister Mimi was supposed to have died in the car accident. Wait, Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2) states that Mimi Miney died in the car accident, but the article quotes Ini as saying she was the driver. Wait, no: the article says, "If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney." But Mimi died in the crash. However, the testimony from Ini in the article (quoted in Evidence 6) says, "I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash, and like, I woke up in a huge sea of flames. I was like, still half-asleep, but I opened the right door and like, got out." So Ini claims she was the passenger, and Mimi was driving. But Mimi died. However, Evidence 18 shows a driver's license photo of Ini, which is in Director Hotti's possession. Maybe this suggests that Ini was actually the driver, which contradicts the newspaper article's claim that Mimi was driving. But how does this relate to the testimonies?

Wait, the testimonies in question here are from Gumshoe, not Ini. So maybe that's a separate issue. Since the question asks for a contradiction between evidence and testimony, and the testimonies here are from Gumshoe, I need to focus on those.

Let me re-examine the testimonies:

Testimony 1: Gumshoe presents the costume as evidence Maya was wearing during the crime.

Testimony 3: Gumshoe claims Maya attacked someone not fighting back.

Looking at Evidence 8 (Autopsy): Dr. Grey was stabbed then shot. The order suggests he might have been incapacitated by the stab, then shot. So the attack could have been on someone not fighting back after the stab. So that could align with Testimony 3.

But perhaps the key contradiction is elsewhere. Let's check Testimony 0: "Sorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence." Not sure what that refers to.

Evidence 9: Pistol with two shots fired, Maya's and Grey's prints. The autopsy says he was shot once. So two shots were fired, one hit Grey, the other perhaps went into Maya's sleeve (Evidence 11's bullet hole). But if Maya's fingerprints are on the gun, that suggests she fired it. But if the bullet hole in her sleeve is from the same gun, that would mean she was shot at by someone else, but the gun has her prints. Contradiction? Hmm.

Alternatively, the contradiction could be between Testimony 3 (victim wasn't fighting back) and the fact that there's a bullet hole in Maya's sleeve, implying a struggle where someone else shot at her. But that's a bit indirect.

Wait, another angle: Evidence 10 is the knife with Maya's fingerprints. Testimony 3 says she attacked someone not fighting back. If she used the knife to stab him first, then he couldn't fight back when she shot him. That fits. So maybe no contradiction there.

Wait, but the blood on Maya's costume (Evidence 11) would be from the stabbing. The bullet hole in the sleeve could be from the shot that killed Grey, but how? If she fired the gun, the bullet hole would be on the victim, not her sleeve. Unless the second shot went through her sleeve. But why would she fire a second shot into her own sleeve? That seems odd. Alternatively, if someone else fired the gun, the second shot hit her sleeve. But then, how come her fingerprints are on the gun? Maybe she struggled with Grey over the gun, leading to two shots: one hitting Grey, one hitting her sleeve. But the autopsy says he was shot at point-blank, so maybe that's possible. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 1 and another evidence. Testimony 1 says Maya was wearing the costume at the time of the crime. Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume) says it has a bullet hole in the sleeve. If the bullet hole was from the crime, then during the crime, the shot that caused the hole must have happened. But if the pistol (Evidence 9) was used by Maya, then the bullet hole in her own sleeve suggests she was shot at, which would imply another person fired. However, the pistol has her fingerprints, implying she used it. That's a contradiction: if she fired the gun, the bullet hole in her sleeve would have to be from her own shot, which is unlikely. Therefore, Testimony 1 (she was wearing the costume with the bullet hole) and Evidence 9 (pistol with her prints, two shots fired) might contradict each other because the presence of her prints on the gun suggests she fired it, but the bullet hole in her sleeve suggests she was shot at, implying another shooter.

But wait, the testimony itself (Testimony 1) is just stating that the costume was worn during the crime. The contradiction would be between that testimony and the evidence about the gun. Alternatively, the bullet hole in the costume (Evidence 11) and the gun's evidence (Evidence 9) having her prints. But the testimony itself is just presenting the costume as evidence. The actual contradiction would be between the presence of the bullet hole and the fact that the gun used was in her possession. So perhaps the testimony (Testimony 1) that she was wearing the costume with the bullet hole, combined with the gun's evidence, implies she was shot at, contradicting her being the shooter. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (victim wasn't fighting back) and the fact that the victim was stabbed first. If he was stabbed, maybe he could have fought back before being shot. But the testimony says he wasn't fighting back at all. However, the autopsy says he was stabbed then shot. So if the stabbing incapacitated him, then he couldn't fight back during the shooting. So maybe that's consistent.

Another possibility: Evidence 14 (Sacred Urn) was broken by Pearl before the murder and under repair. If the urn was broken, maybe it relates to the channeling, but not sure how that ties to the testimonies.

Wait, Evidence 15: Cloth Scrap with blood found in the incinerator. If this cloth has blood, maybe it's from the real culprit. But how does that tie to the testimonies?

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 2 from Gumshoe: "As you can see, it's covered in blood." Referring to the costume (Testimony 1). The costume (Evidence 11) does have blood splatters, which aligns. No contradiction there.

Wait, perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 8. Testimony 3 says the victim wasn't fighting back, but Evidence 8 says he was stabbed first. If the stabbing happened first, maybe he did fight back initially, then was shot when he couldn't. But the testimony says "without a doubt, was not fighting back," implying the victim didn't resist at all during the attack. However, if he was stabbed first, he might have tried to resist before being incapacitated. So there's a possible contradiction here: the autopsy suggests two separate attacks (stab then shot), which might imply a struggle, while the testimony claims the victim didn't fight back at all.

But the testimony says "attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back." So the entire attack sequence (stab and shot) happened without the victim fighting back. If the victim was stabbed first and then shot, maybe he couldn't fight back after the stab, but during the stabbing, he might have. However, if the stab was immediately incapacitating, then perhaps he couldn't fight back. The contradiction would depend on whether the stab allowed for any resistance.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is elsewhere. Let me think again.

Evidence 9: Pistol has Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. If Maya used the gun, her prints would be there. But the autopsy says the gunshot was at point-blank. If Grey was shot after being stabbed, maybe he was already dead or unconscious, so his fingerprints on the gun would be postmortem, which is impossible. Wait, if Grey was dead when the gun was fired, his fingerprints couldn't be on the gun. But Evidence 9 says the pistol bears both Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. That would imply that Grey handled the gun before he died. But if he was stabbed first, then shot, how could he have touched the gun after being stabbed? Unless he grabbed the gun during the struggle after being stabbed but before being shot. But if the stab was in the chest, maybe he couldn't. This could be a contradiction: Grey's fingerprints on the gun suggest he handled it before death, but according to the autopsy, he was stabbed first, which might have incapacitated him, making it impossible for him to touch the gun afterward. Therefore, the presence of Grey's prints on the gun (Evidence 9) contradicts the autopsy report (Evidence 8) which states he was stabbed first, then shot. But this is a contradiction between two pieces of evidence, not between evidence and testimony.

But the question asks for a contradiction between evidence and testimony. So maybe not this.

Alternatively, the testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 3) states that the defendant killed someone who wasn't fighting back. If the victim was able to handle the gun (leaving his prints), that suggests he was fighting back, contradicting the testimony. So the presence of Grey's prints on the gun (Evidence 9) would contradict Testimony 3, which claims he wasn't fighting back. Because if Grey touched the gun, he might have been trying to defend himself, hence fighting back.

So Evidence 9 (Grey's fingerprints on the pistol) contradicts Testimony 3 (victim wasn't fighting back). That would be the contradiction. Because if Grey's prints are on the gun, he must have handled it, implying he was trying to use it to defend himself, thus fighting back, which contradicts the testimony that he wasn't.

Yes, that makes sense. So the testimony says the victim didn't fight back, but the evidence shows the victim's fingerprints on the gun, indicating he did interact with it, suggesting he tried to fight back.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 3 by Gumshoe states that the victim, Dr. Grey, "was not fighting back." However, Evidence 9 (the Pistol) indicates the pistol bears both Maya's and **Dr. Grey's fingerprints**. If Grey's fingerprints are on the gun, this implies he handled it during the altercation, contradicting the claim that he did not fight back. This inconsistency points to a contradiction between Testimony 3 and Evidence 9.
{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through each testimony and checking the evidence.

First, the testimonies are all from Detective Gumshoe, right? So Testimony 0 to 4. Let's read them one by one.

Testimony 0: During the channeling, the defendant (Maya, I assume) saw her chance to stab the victim (Dr. Grey) in the chest. So they're saying Maya stabbed him first.

Testimony 1: The victim used his last strength to fight back. That follows Testimony 0.

Testimony 2: While fighting, the victim took out his gun. So after being stabbed, he pulled out a gun.

Testimony 3: The victim shot but missed because they were too close.

Testimony 4: The defendant took the gun and finished him off.

Now, looking at the evidence related to the cause of death. Evidence 8 is Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report. It says he was stabbed in the chest first, then shot in the forehead at point-blank. The gunshot has gunpowder residue, which makes sense for a close shot. The pistol (Evidence 9) is the murder weapon, which was Grey's own gun. Two shots were fired, and it has Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. Also, the knife (Evidence 10) has Maya's prints.

But wait, Testimony 4 says Maya took the gun from Grey after he missed and shot him. However, the autopsy report says he was shot after being stabbed. The testimonies suggest the order was stab, then struggle, then Grey takes out the gun, misses, and Maya takes it to shoot him. That aligns with the autopsy's order of stab first, then shot. So maybe that's consistent.

Wait, but Testimony 0 says Maya stabbed him during the channeling. Then the fight back, then the gun. But the autopsy says he was shot at point-blank. The gunshot residue on the forehead would indicate the gun was very close, which matches the scenario where Maya took the gun and shot him point-blank. So that seems to fit.

But wait, looking at the pistol (Evidence 9) says two shots were fired. Testimony 3 says the victim took a shot and missed. Then Testimony 4 says Maya took the gun and ended it. So that would be two shots: one missed by Grey, one by Maya? But the autopsy says he was shot once in the forehead. So if two shots were fired, one missed (from Grey) and one hit (from Maya). That would match. But then why does the autopsy mention the shot to the forehead but not another shot? Wait, the autopsy says he was stabbed and then shot. The gunshot is once. The pistol's evidence says two shots fired. So there's a discrepancy here. The autopsy only mentions one shot (the fatal one), but the gun was fired twice. Where's the other bullet?

Looking at Evidence 4 (Folding Screen) and Evidence 17 (Clothing Box), both have bullet holes. Evidence 4: a bullet hole 8 inches off the ground. Evidence 17: same. So maybe the first shot from Grey hit the folding screen or clothing box, and the second shot from Maya killed him. That would explain two shots. But the autopsy report mentions only the shot to the forehead. So maybe the two shots are the one that missed (Grey's) and the one that hit (Maya's). But the autopsy would note only the fatal shot, so that's okay.

Wait, but Testimony 3 says the victim took a shot but missed because they were too close. How do you miss at close range? Maybe he was disoriented from being stabbed. But the gunshot residue on the forehead indicates the gun was very close when fired. So if Maya shot him after taking the gun, that shot would be point-blank, leaving residue. That's consistent. So Testimony 4 and Evidence 8 (autopsy) agree.

Hmm. Maybe another angle. The knife (Evidence 10) has Maya's fingerprints, which supports Testimony 0 that she stabbed him. The pistol has both Maya and Grey's prints, which would make sense if he handled it and she took it. So maybe the testimonies are consistent with evidence.

Wait, but looking at Testimony 4: "the defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun, and ended it..." So Maya took the gun and shot him. The autopsy says he was shot in the forehead after being stabbed, which matches. The pistol had two shots fired. So one shot by Grey (missed) and one by Maya (hit). That's two shots. The autopsy mentions the shot to the forehead (the fatal one) but the other shot is accounted for by the bullet holes in the screen or box. So that's consistent.

Wait, but maybe there's a contradiction elsewhere. Let's check other evidence. Evidence 11 is Maya's Costume. It has blood splatters and a bullet hole in the sleeve. The robe is otherwise clean. So if Maya was shot at, maybe Grey's missed shot hit her sleeve? But Testimony 3 says Grey missed because they were too close. If they were too close, the bullet hole in her sleeve would make sense. So the bullet hole in her robe could be from Grey's missed shot. Then the second shot from Maya's gun killed him. So Evidence 11 (bullet hole in sleeve) and Testimony 3 (Grey missed due to proximity) would align. But how does that contradict?

Wait, maybe the bullet hole in the robe is from when Maya took the gun and shot him. But the autopsy says the shot was to the forehead. So the bullet hole in her sleeve would be from a different shot. If the gun was fired twice, once by Grey (missed, hitting the robe) and once by Maya (killed him), then the two shots make sense. So that's consistent.

Hmm. Maybe I need to look for another contradiction. Let's check other evidence. Evidence 15 is a cloth scrap with blood found in the incinerator. Maybe that's related to someone else, but not sure.

Wait, looking at Testimony 0: During the channeling, Maya stabbed him. But if the channeling was happening, maybe there's evidence about the Sacred Urn (Evidence 14), which was broken by Pearl before the murder. But not sure how that ties in.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 18: Ini's driver's license photo. And the newspaper clipping (Evidence 6) says that Mimi Miney died in a car crash a year ago, but the article quotes Ini as the survivor. But there's a character, Mimi Miney (Character 7), listed as dead, and Ini Miney (Character 6) as alive. However, the testimony from Ini (if any) isn't here. The testimonies in question are all from Gumshoe about the murder sequence.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between the order of events in the testimony and the evidence. Let me re-examine. The testimonies suggest that Maya stabbed Grey, then during the struggle, Grey pulled out the gun, fired a shot (missed), then Maya took the gun and shot him. But according to the autopsy (Evidence 8), the victim was first stabbed in the chest, then shot in the forehead. The gunshot has gunpowder residue, which supports a close shot. So the order in the testimony matches the autopsy. So maybe that's not the contradiction.

Wait, but the pistol (Evidence 9) has two shots fired. The autopsy mentions only one gunshot wound. So where's the second shot? The folding screen (Evidence 4) and clothing box (Evidence 17) have bullet holes. So the two shots would be one hitting the screen/box (Grey's missed shot) and one killing him (Maya's). That's consistent. So no contradiction here.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let's check Testimony 4 again: "the defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun, and ended it..." So Maya took the gun and shot him. The pistol (Evidence 9) has Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. That makes sense. But the knife (Evidence 10) has Maya's fingerprints. So all that is consistent.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and some evidence. Testimony 0 says Maya stabbed him during the channeling. The knife (Evidence 10) is a fruit knife belonging to the Feys with Maya's prints. That's consistent. But the autopsy says he was stabbed first, then shot, which matches the testimonies.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the timeline. The murder happens during the channeling. The Sacred Urn (Evidence 14) was broken by Pearl before the murder. The channeling chamber's layout is in Evidence 7. The photos (12 and 13) show Maya at the scene with Grey dead. The blood on Maya's costume (11) could be from the stabbing. The bullet hole in her sleeve could be from Grey's missed shot. 

Wait, the problem asks for a contradiction between evidence and testimony. Let me check again.

Wait, Testimony 0 says Maya stabbed him during the channeling. The autopsy confirms the stab was first. Testimony 2 says during the fight, Grey took out his gun. Then he shot and missed (Testimony 3). Then Maya took the gun and shot him (Testimony 4). The pistol has two shots fired. The autopsy confirms he was shot once. The other shot is accounted for by the bullet holes in the screen or box, and the bullet hole in Maya's sleeve. So that's consistent.

Is there a testimony that contradicts an evidence?

Wait, looking at Evidence 8: Autopsy says he was shot at point-blank. Testimony 3 says the victim missed because they were too close. But how can you miss at point-blank? That seems contradictory. If they were too close, maybe the gun was pressed against the forehead, so he couldn't miss. But Testimony 3 says he missed. However, the autopsy says he was shot in the forehead, which would be a hit, not a miss. Wait, no. Testimony 3 says the victim (Grey) took a shot but missed because they were too close. Then Maya took the gun and shot him. So the missed shot is from Grey, and the hit is from Maya. But the autopsy says the shot that killed him was at point-blank, which would be Maya's shot. That's okay. So Testimony 3 is about Grey's shot missing, and the autopsy is about Maya's shot hitting. So no contradiction there.

Wait, but the autopsy says he was shot after being stabbed. So the order is stab -> shot. The testimonies also follow that order. So no contradiction.

Wait, maybe another angle. The knife (Evidence 10) is a fruit knife belonging to the Fey's with Maya's prints. That supports Testimony 0. The gun (Evidence 9) has Maya's prints, supporting Testimony 4. 

Hmm. Maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let's check the other evidence. Evidence 11: Maya's Costume has a bullet hole in the sleeve. If Testimony 3 says Grey shot and missed, perhaps the bullet hole in the sleeve is from that missed shot. But if they were too close, how did the bullet hit the sleeve? Maybe it's possible. Alternatively, maybe the bullet hole in the sleeve is from when Maya fired the gun, but that's less likely. But this is possible, not necessarily a contradiction.

Wait, the testimony says Grey missed because they were too close, but the bullet hole in the sleeve suggests the shot did hit her robe. So maybe that's a contradiction. If the shot missed, then the bullet hole in her sleeve would mean it didn't miss. But Testimony 3 says the shot missed. However, the bullet hole in the sleeve could be from the shot. So that's a contradiction between Testimony 3 and Evidence 11.

Wait, Testimony 3: "The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed." If the victim (Grey) fired and missed, but Maya's robe has a bullet hole, that suggests the shot hit her robe, meaning it didn't miss. That's a contradiction. So Testimony 3 claims the shot missed, but Evidence 11 shows a bullet hole in Maya's sleeve, implying the shot actually hit her robe. Therefore, the testimony and evidence contradict each other.

Yes, that seems like a contradiction. So Testimony 3 says Grey's shot missed, but Evidence 11's bullet hole in the sleeve suggests the shot hit her, meaning it didn't miss. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 11.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 3 states that Dr. Grey fired a shot but missed due to proximity. However, Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume) describes a bullet hole in the robe's sleeve. A bullet hole in the garment implies the shot did **not** miss, contradicting the testimony's claim of a missed shot. The presence of the bullet hole suggests the shot hit Maya's sleeve, directly conflicting with the assertion that Grey "missed."
{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}

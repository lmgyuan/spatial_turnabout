Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look through the given evidence and testimonies to find contradictions. The characters involved are numerous, but the testimonies are all from Larry Butz (Character 4). The evidences are a mix of various items, reports, and photos related to the case.

Looking at the testimonies by Butz:

Testimony 0: He was out in a boat on the lake that night.
Testimony 2: He quietly slipped the boat back into the rental dock.
Testimony 3: He heard a "bang" just as he was thinking about going home.
Testimony 4: He looked out over the lake but didn't notice the boat.
Testimony 5: He went home after hearing a single gunshot.

Now, the key point here is the timing of the gunshot and the presence of the boat. Let's check the evidence related to this.

Evidence 11: Lotta's Deposition states that she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. But Butz in Testimony 5 mentions hearing a single gunshot. That's a discrepancy in the number of shots heard.

Additionally, Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) and Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) might be relevant. Evidence 4 is taken on 12/25 at 12:15 AM, which is just after midnight. Evidence 16 is taken on 12/24 at 11:50 PM. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) might show something that contradicts Butz's testimony about not seeing the boat. If the photo taken at 12:15 AM shows a boat, then Butz's Testimony 4 (not noticing the boat) would be contradicted. But the description of Evidence 4 says "taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Click here for details." Without more info, maybe the content of the photo is key. However, Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) is taken on 12/24 at 11:50 PM and shows an empty lake. If Butz was on the boat that night (Testimony 0), and the Second Lake Photo at 11:50 PM shows an empty lake, that would contradict his presence there. But he mentioned being out that night, which could be the 24th or 25th. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) states time of death as 24th or 25th. So if Butz was in a boat on the 24th, and the photo at 11:50 PM on 24th shows empty lake, that's a contradiction. But the testimony says "that night," which might refer to the night of the murder, which is the 24th leading into 25th. So if the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) is taken at 11:50 PM on 24th and shows no boat, but Butz claims to have been in a boat that night, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 16 and Testimony 0 would contradict each other.

Wait, but Testimony 0 is "That night, I was out in a boat on the lake." If "that night" refers to the night of the murder, which is the 24th/25th, then the photo taken on 24th at 11:50 PM showing an empty lake would contradict Butz's presence in a boat at that time. Therefore, Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) contradicts Testimony 0 (Butz being in a boat that night).

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says he heard a "bang" just as he was thinking about going home, and Testimony 5 says after a single gunshot he went home. But Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) mentions two gunshots. So Testimony 5 (single gunshot) contradicts Evidence 11 (two gunshots). That's another contradiction.

So which one is it? The user asks for only one pair.

The user's previous answer example contradicted a testimony directly with evidence about the same point. Here, Testimony 5 vs Evidence 11 is a clear contradiction: Butz says he heard one gunshot, but Lotta's testimony (Evidence 11) says two. So the pair would be Evidence 11 and Testimony 5. But wait, Evidence 11 is "Lotta's Deposition" which is her testimony, but in this setup, Evidence 11 is considered evidence, not testimony. The testimonies listed are only those from the characters, which in this case, all are from Butz. So Evidence 11 is a deposition (testimony from Lotta Hart), but in the provided data, Testimonies are only those listed (Testimony 0-5 by Butz). Therefore, Evidence 11's statement is from Lotta, which is considered evidence here, not part of the testimonies section. Therefore, Testimony 5 (Butz's claim of a single gunshot) contradicts Evidence 11 (Lotta's statement of two gunshots).

Yes, that's a contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11. But according to the problem's structure, the user wants the answer in the format {"evidence": X, "testimony": Y}, where X is the evidence number and Y the testimony number. Therefore, in this case, Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) contradicts Testimony 5 (Butz's single gunshot). So the correct pair would be evidence 11 and testimony 5.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 5 states that Larry Butz heard a single gunshot and went home. However, Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) states that Lotta Hart heard two gunshot-like sounds just after midnight on 12/25. This directly contradicts the number of gunshots reported, indicating a discrepancy between Butz's testimony and the evidence provided by Lotta's deposition.
{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair, and the answer must be in JSON at the end. 

First, I'll list out the testimonies and the evidences to see where there's a conflict. 

Looking at the testimonies, Testimony 5 from Larry Butz says: "Just when she said 'Hey! It's almost Christmas!' I heard the gunshot!" So he claims to have heard a gunshot when the DJ mentioned Christmas approaching. That would place the gunshot around midnight, maybe a bit before, since "almost Christmas" could be like 11:50 PM on the 24th.

Now, looking at the evidences, Evidence 4 is the Lake Photo, taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Then Evidence 16 is the Second Lake Photo, taken on 12/24 at 11:50 PM. These photos might show the state of the lake at those times. 

But more importantly, Evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition: "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25." So Lotta heard the shots after midnight, which is on the 25th. However, Larry Butz's Testimony 5 says he heard the gunshot when the DJ said "It's almost Christmas," which would be before midnight on the 24th. 

But wait, there's also Evidence 3, the Autopsy Report for Robert, which states the time of death as "sometime on the 24th or 25th." But the exact timing is conflicting between the testimonies. Larry says he heard the shot before midnight (24th), Lotta's deposition says after midnight (25th). But how does that tie into evidence?

Wait, the Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times and has Edgeworth's prints. The ballistic markings match the bullet in the victim (Evidence 9). The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) at 12:15 AM on 25th might show something related, but the Second Lake Photo (16) at 11:50 PM on 24th shows an empty lake. If the murder happened after midnight (as per Lotta's testimony), but Larry's testimony says before midnight, that's a contradiction. However, the user is asking for a contradiction between evidence and testimony, not between two testimonies.

Looking at Testimony 5 (Butz) stating the gunshot when the DJ said "almost Christmas," which would be around 11:50 PM on 24th. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) says time of death is 24th or 25th. However, if the gunshot was at 11:50 PM on 24th, but the murder weapon (Pistol) was fired three times. Maybe the photos can help. The Second Lake Photo (16) is taken at 11:50 PM on 24th and shows an empty lake. If the murder happened then, but the photo shows nothing? Or perhaps the photo at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) shows the body? If the body wasn't present in the 11:50 PM photo, but was there at 12:15 AM, then the murder happened between those times. But Larry's testimony about hearing the shot at 11:50 PM would conflict if the actual murder was after midnight. However, the Autopsy Report allows for both dates. 

Alternatively, maybe the gunshots in the testimonies. Larry says he heard a gunshot around 11:50 PM (when the DJ said "almost Christmas"), while Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) says two sounds like gunshots just after midnight. So if the actual murder occurred after midnight, but Larry claims to have heard it before, that's a contradiction. But again, that's between testimonies. 

But the question asks for evidence and testimony contradiction. Let's see: The Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. If Larry's Testimony 5 says he heard one gunshot, but the Pistol was fired three times, but that's not necessarily a contradiction because Larry might have heard one of the shots. Alternatively, maybe the photos. If the Second Lake Photo (16) at 11:50 PM shows the lake empty, and the murder happened then, but the photo doesn't show any disturbance, that could be a contradiction. But Testimony 5 says the gunshot at that time, which would mean the murder happened then. If the photo taken at 11:50 PM doesn't show the body, but the murder was at that time, that's a contradiction. However, the Autopsy Report says the time of death is 24th or 25th, so the time is not precise. 

Wait, Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) is taken at 12:15 AM on the 25th. If that photo shows the body, then the murder happened between 11:50 PM (when the second photo was empty) and 12:15 AM. So Larry's Testimony 5 says he heard the shot at around 11:50 PM (when the DJ said "It's almost Christmas"), but the murder actually happened after midnight, which would contradict his testimony. But that's a conflict between Testimony 5 and Evidence 4 (if Evidence 4 shows the body wasn't there at 12:15 AM, but that's not stated. Wait, Evidence 4's description just says "Taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Click here for details." If clicking details would show the body, then the murder happened before 12:15. But the Second Lake Photo (16) at 11:50 PM shows empty. So the murder happened between 11:50 PM and 12:15 AM. So if Larry heard the shot at 11:50 PM, maybe that's possible. But if the actual shot was at 12:15 AM, then contradiction. However, the problem is that we need to find a direct contradiction between one evidence and one testimony. 

Alternatively, let's look at Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition): she heard two gunshots after midnight on 12/25. Testimony 5 from Larry Butz says he heard a gunshot when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!", which would be just before midnight. So if the shots were after midnight according to Lotta's evidence, but Larry says before, that's a contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11. But the user wants an evidence-testimony pair, so if Evidence 11 is considered, then Testimony 5 contradicts it. But Evidence 11 is Lotta's testimony, so the contradiction would be between two testimonies. The user is asking for evidence and testimony. So perhaps another angle.

Looking at Testimony 5: "Just when she said 'Hey! It's almost Christmas!' I heard the gunshot!" Assuming that the DJ's comment would be at a specific time, say 11:55 PM on the 24th. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) states the time of death as 24th or 25th, which is broad. However, maybe the Lake Photos. The Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) taken at 11:50 PM on the 24th shows an empty lake. If the murder occurred at 11:50 PM, then the photo taken at that time would show the crime scene. But if the photo shows no body, then Larry's testimony about hearing the shot then would be contradicted by the photo. So if the photo (Evidence 16) shows the lake is empty at 11:50 PM, but Larry says he heard the shot then, that would mean the murder hadn't happened yet, which contradicts the time of death. Wait, the Autopsy says time of death is 24th or 25th, but the photo at 11:50 PM on 24th shows no body, so the murder must have occurred after that. But Testimony 5 claims the shot was heard around 11:50 PM. So if the photo at 11:50 PM shows no body, the murder happened after that, meaning the shot Larry heard wasn't the murder shot. That would contradict his testimony. Thus, Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) contradicts Testimony 5. So the JSON would be {"evidence": 16, "testimony":5}.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 5 by Larry Butz claims he heard a gunshot when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!", which likely occurred just before midnight on 12/24. However, Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) shows the lake empty at 11:50 PM on 12/24. If the murder occurred at that time, the photo would likely capture evidence of the crime (e.g., the body or disturbance), but it shows nothing. This contradicts Larry's testimony about hearing the gunshot before midnight, suggesting the murder happened later, after the photo was taken.
{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}

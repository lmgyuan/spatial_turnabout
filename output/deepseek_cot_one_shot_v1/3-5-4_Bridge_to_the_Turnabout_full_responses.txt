Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to look through the evidence and testimonies to find contradictions. The user wants one pair where a testimony contradicts evidence.

Starting with the testimonies from Iris. Testimony 0 says she went to the Inner Temple and saw everything happen in the garden. Let me check the evidences. Evidence 12 is Iris's Testimony stating she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and was in her room until the murder was discovered. Wait, that's conflicting. If according to her own testimony (Testimony 0), she was in the Inner Temple, but Evidence 12 says she was in her room. That directly contradicts. 

Wait, but Evidence 12 is labeled as "Iris's Testimony" but in the description, it says she was in her room until the murder was discovered. So maybe that's a written testimony, and the Testimony 0 is her verbal account. So if in Evidence 12 she claims to be in her room, but in Testimony 0 she says she was at the Inner Temple, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) contradicts Testimony 0 (her statement during the trial). 

Alternatively, looking at other testimonies. Testimony 1-5 from Iris describe Mystic Elise attacking Maya with a staff, then pulling a dagger, and Maya defending herself. Now, looking at the evidence: Evidence 10 says the Shichishito had the victim's blood and suspect's prints but is not the murder weapon. The actual murder weapon might be the dagger (Evidence 19), but the autopsy report (Evidence 11) states cause of death was a stab in the back. However, the dagger's blood doesn't match the victim's. Wait, that's confusing. 

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says Elise pulled a dagger from her robe. But Evidence 9 mentions the victim's staff has a hidden sword, and Evidence 10 is a Shichishito (a type of sword) which is not the murder weapon. Maybe the real weapon was the dagger, but Evidence 19 says the dagger's blood doesn't match the victim. So perhaps Testimony 3's claim about the dagger contradicts Evidence 19. But the autopsy report says death was from a stab in the back. If the dagger (Evidence 19) isn't the murder weapon, but the Shichishito (Evidence 10) is not the murder weapon either, perhaps the actual weapon is the staff's hidden sword. But the autopsy report says stab wound. Hmm, maybe that's another angle. 

Wait, the key contradiction I first thought is between Iris's Testimony 0 and Evidence 12. Because if Evidence 12 is her official statement that she was in her room, but in Testimony 0 she claims to have been at the Inner Temple, that's a direct contradiction. So the answer would be Evidence 12 and Testimony 0. Let me check again. Evidence 12: "Iris's Testimony: Rang lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered." So her own testimony (as evidence) says she was in her room. But in Testimony 0 (her in-court statement), she says she was at the Inner Temple. That's a clear contradiction. So the correct pair is Evidence 12 and Testimony 0.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 0 by Iris claims she witnessed the crime in the garden of the Inner Temple. However, Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) states she was in her room until the murder was discovered. This directly contradicts her presence at the crime scene.
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 0}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony. Let's start by going through all the given evidence and testimonies carefully.

First, the characters. There's a lot here, but maybe the key ones are Iris, Maya, Elise, and others involved in the murder at Hazakura Temple. The evidences and testimonies likely relate to Elise's murder.

Looking at the testimonies provided (Testimonies 0-4), all are given by Iris. She's describing the events leading up to Elise's death. Let's summarize her account:

Testimony 0: Maya was hit over the head with the staff but stumbled briefly.
Testimony 1: Maya dodged Elise's next attack and stole her weapon.
Testimony 2: Elise was on the defensive, back to the stone lantern.
Testimony 3: Maya stabbed Elise.
Testimony 4: Elise flung the knife away and collapsed.

Now, the key points here are that Maya is the attacker, using a knife (since Testimony 4 mentions a knife being flung away). The murder weapon according to Iris's testimony is the knife (dagger?), which Maya used to stab Elise.

Now, let's check the evidences related to the murder weapon and cause of death.

Evidence 10: Shichishito - described as the apparent murder weapon, with victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, but it's noted that it's "not the murder weapon." Wait, that's confusing. So even though it has the blood and prints, it's not the actual weapon. So the real murder weapon is something else.

Evidence 11: Elise's Autopsy Report. Cause of death is loss of blood from a stab in the back. The body fell 10 ft after death. So the fatal wound is a stab in the back.

Evidence 19: Dagger. Found behind a tree in the Inner Temple garden. The blood doesn't match the victim's. So the dagger found there isn't the murder weapon either, since the blood isn't the victim's.

But according to Iris's Testimony 3, Maya stabbed Elise, and Testimony 4 mentions a knife being flung away. However, the autopsy says the cause was a stab in the back. But Iris's testimony describes Elise being on the defensive with her back to the stone lantern when Maya stabbed her. If Elise's back was to the lantern, then Maya would have stabbed her in the front, not the back. Wait, that's a possible contradiction. Let me check again.

In Testimony 2: Elise was on the defensive with her back to the stone lantern. Then Testimony 3 says Maya stabbed her. If Elise's back was to the lantern, then Maya would be facing her, so the stab would be to the front. But the autopsy says the stab was in the back. That's a contradiction. But wait, maybe the movement... Or perhaps the stab was from behind. Let's think: If Elise is facing Maya, and Maya stabs her in the front, then the wound would be in the chest, not the back. But the autopsy says the stab was in the back. Therefore, Iris's testimony claims Maya stabbed Elise from the front, but the autopsy says the wound was in the back. That's a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe there's another angle. But according to the testimony sequence, Elise is with her back to the stone lantern when Maya stabs her. So the direction of the stab would be towards the front of Elise. But the autopsy states the stab was in the back. Therefore, this is a contradiction between Iris's Testimony 3 (and the sequence leading up to it) and the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11).

But let's check other possibilities. Evidence 10 says the Shichishito had the victim's blood but isn't the murder weapon. The actual murder weapon might be the dagger (Evidence 19), but its blood doesn't match. Wait, the autopsy says the cause was a stab in the back. The Shichishito is a sword, perhaps, but it's not the weapon. The real murder weapon must be something else. However, the dagger (Evidence 19) has blood that's not the victim's. So maybe the murder weapon is another knife, not found yet. But according to Iris's testimony, the knife used was flung away (Testimony 4). If that's the dagger (Evidence 19), but its blood isn't the victim's, then that's another contradiction. But the main contradiction here is between the location of the stab (back vs front) according to testimony and autopsy.

So the key contradiction is between Iris's Testimony 3 (Maya stabbing Elise while Elise's back is to the lantern) and Evidence 11 (stab wound in the back). If Elise was stabbed in the back, then the attacker would have to be behind her, but according to the testimony, Maya was in front of her. Therefore, the testimony's account of the stabbing direction contradicts the autopsy's finding on the wound's location.

Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 11 (Elise's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 3 (Iris stating Maya stabbed Elise when Elise's back was to the lantern, implying a front stab).

Let's analyze the testimonies and evidence step by step. Iris's Testimony 3 claims Maya stabbed Elise while Elise's back was to the stone lantern, implying a frontal stab. However, Evidence 11 (Autopsy Report) states the fatal wound was a stab in the back. This contradiction arises because the testimony suggests a front-facing attack, while the evidence confirms the injury was from behind.  
{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's dive into this. The user wants me to find a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony from the given list. Let me start by listing out all the testimonies and then check each against the evidence.

First, looking at the Testimonies provided by Iris:

Testimony 0: She called out to Mystic Maya after Mystic Elise died. Not sure if there's evidence contradicting this yet.

Testimony 1: Iris felt it was her duty to protect the future Master of Kurain Tradition. That seems more motive-related, maybe not a direct contradiction.

Testimony 2: She removed the body from the Inner Temple by herself.

Testimony 3: She dragged the body across Dusky Bridge.

Testimony 4: Used a snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple.

Testimony 5: Used the Shichishito to alter the wound's appearance.

Testimony 6: She states that by the time of the murder, the snow had already stopped.

Now, let's check the Evidence. The key might be in the timings or physical evidence related to the murder.

Looking at Evidence 7: Weather Data. It says snow was from 7 PM to about 10:50 PM. The murder's time of death is in Evidence 11: Elise's Autopsy Report, which states time of death between 10-11 PM. So the murder occurred during the snow period. But Iris's Testimony 6 claims that when the murder took place, the snow had already stopped. Wait, the autopsy says death was between 10-11 PM, and the snow stopped at 10:50. So if the murder happened at 10 PM, snow was still ongoing until 10:50. But Iris says the snow had already stopped when the murder took place. That's a contradiction because the snow stopped at 10:50, but the time of death could be as early as 10 PM. Wait, but the murder's time is 10-11 PM. So if the murder occurred after 10:50 PM, then the snow had stopped, but if it happened before, then snow was still falling. However, Testimony 6 says "By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped." So according to Iris, the murder happened after 10:50. However, the weather data says snow stopped around 10:50 PM. But the autopsy report allows for death up to 11 PM. So if the murder happened at, say, 10:55, the snow had already stopped. But the contradiction here would depend on whether the murder's exact time can be pinned. However, the weather data also mentions lightning strikes from 10 to approx. 11 PM, and lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. The fire started and went out after 30 minutes, so maybe that's related. But focusing on Testimony 6 and Evidence 7: If Iris claims the snow had already stopped when the murder occurred, but according to the weather data, the snow stopped at 10:50. If the murder happened before 10:50, then the snow was still ongoing, contradicting her testimony. However, the autopsy time is 10-11 PM, so the murder could have happened any time in that window. So unless there's another piece of evidence that pins the murder time more precisely. Alternatively, maybe another contradiction.

Looking at Testimony 3: Iris dragged the body across Dusky Bridge. But according to Evidence 15: Larry's Sketch, which shows the bridge on fire. Evidence 7 says lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM, which probably started the fire. So if the bridge was on fire, how could Iris drag the body across it after the murder? The murder happened between 10-11 PM. The bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45, causing a fire. So if Iris dragged the body across the bridge after the murder, which was after 10:45, the bridge would be on fire. That seems impossible. So Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 15 (the sketch of the burning bridge) and Evidence 7's lightning strike time. However, the user wants only one pair. Let me check the exact details.

Testimony 3: "I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge." If the bridge was on fire from 10:45 PM, and the murder happened between 10-11 PM, then if the murder was after 10:45, the bridge was on fire. So dragging the body across a burning bridge would be impossible. Alternatively, maybe the murder happened before 10:45, but then the bridge wasn't on fire yet, so dragging across would be possible. However, the problem arises if the murder's time is after the bridge caught fire. But the autopsy gives a window. So perhaps the contradiction is that Iris claims to have crossed the bridge after the murder, but the bridge was already on fire. Therefore, Testimony 3 (dragging across Dusky Bridge) contradicts with Evidence 7 (lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 causing fire) and Evidence 15 (sketch shows bridge on fire). Alternatively, Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) which shows tracks from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge, but maybe that's not directly contradicting.

Alternatively, Testimony 6: Iris says snow had stopped when the murder took place. But according to Evidence 7, snow stopped at 10:50. So if the murder was at 10:50 or later, snow had stopped. But if the murder was at 10:45 (when lightning struck), then snow was still ongoing. But the autopsy allows death up to 11 PM. So unless there's a specific time mentioned elsewhere. Let me check the autopsy report again. Evidence 11: Elise's Autopsy Report. Time of death between 10-11 PM. So the murder could have been anytime in that hour. But Iris's Testimony 6 says that when the murder took place, snow had already stopped. But the snow stopped at 10:50. So if the murder occurred between 10:50 and 11 PM, then her statement is correct. But the problem is that the murder could have been before 10:50, making her statement false. However, there's no direct evidence that the murder was before 10:50. So maybe that's not a solid contradiction.

Another angle: Testimony 5: Iris used the Shichishito to alter the wound. But Evidence 10 states that the Shichishito had the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints but is not the murder weapon. Wait, the actual murder weapon was a different object. So if the Shichishito was used to alter the wound, but it's not the murder weapon, maybe that's a contradiction. But how? The autopsy says cause of death was a stab in the back. The Shichishito is a different weapon. Wait, but the murder weapon is the dagger or something else? Let me check Evidence 10: Shichishito is the apparent murder weapon but is not the actual one. The real murder weapon is the dagger (Evidence 19?), which has blood not matching the victim. Wait, no. Evidence 10: Shichishito had victim's blood and suspect's prints but is not the murder weapon. So the murder was done with another weapon, but the Shichishito was used to alter the wound. So if Iris used the Shichishito to alter the wound, which is not the murder weapon, maybe there's a contradiction here. But she could have used it post-mortem. So perhaps that's not a contradiction. The Shichishito was used to change the wound, but it's not the murder weapon. That's possible. So maybe no contradiction there.

Back to Testimony 3 and the bridge. If the bridge was on fire when she dragged the body across, but Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15) shows the bridge on fire. The bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM (Evidence 7). So if the murder happened after 10:45, the bridge was on fire. If Iris dragged the body across after that, it's impossible. But if the murder happened before 10:45, she could have dragged it across before the fire. However, the autopsy time is 10-11 PM. So the murder could have been before 10:45. But how does that interact with Testimony 6? If the murder happened before 10:50, then snow was still falling (Testimony 6 says snow had stopped). So if the murder was at, say, 10:30, then snow was still ongoing, contradicting Testimony 6. But if the murder was at 10:55, then snow had stopped, and the bridge was on fire (since lightning struck at 10:45). So in that case, Testimony 6 would be correct (snow stopped), but dragging the body across a burning bridge (Testimony 3) would be impossible. Therefore, if the murder occurred after 10:50, Testimony 6 is correct, but Testimony 3 is impossible. If the murder occurred before 10:45, then Testimony 3 is possible, but Testimony 6 is false. So the contradiction is between Testimony 6 (snow had stopped during the murder) and the Weather Data (Evidence 7) which shows snow stopped at 10:50. So if the murder happened at 10:50 or later, snow had stopped, which aligns with Testimony 6. But the murder time is 10-11 PM. So there's a possibility, but it's not a direct contradiction unless we can tie the murder time to when the snow was still falling.

Wait, but Testimony 6 says "By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped." So Iris is claiming that when the murder occurred, snow had already ceased. However, according to the weather data, snow stopped at 10:50. So if the murder happened at 10:50 or later, her statement is true. If it happened before 10:50, her statement is false. But the autopsy gives a window of 10-11 PM. So unless there's evidence that the murder occurred before 10:50, there's no direct contradiction. However, maybe another piece of evidence pins the time. Let me check Evidence 16: Crystal Sphere found near Dusky Bridge, half-covered in snow. If the snow stopped at 10:50, and the sphere was found half-covered, maybe implying it was there during snowfall. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, Evidence 15: Larry's Sketch shows the bridge on fire with a silhouette gliding over it. If the bridge was on fire when the murder occurred, then the timing would be after 10:45. So if the murder was after 10:45, then snow was still falling until 10:50. So if Iris says the snow had stopped (Testimony 6), but the murder happened between 10:45 and 10:50, then snow was still falling, contradicting her. However, the exact time of the murder isn't established beyond the 10-11 PM window. Therefore, it's possible that the murder occurred after 10:50, making her testimony correct. So maybe the contradiction isn't here.

Looking again at Testimony 3: She dragged the body across Dusky Bridge. But if the bridge was on fire (Evidence 15), how could she do that? The bridge caught fire at 10:45 PM. If the murder was after that, dragging the body across a burning bridge seems impossible. However, if the murder was before 10:45, then the bridge wasn't on fire yet. But the autopsy time is 10-11 PM. So the murder could have been at 10:30, she dragged the body across before the bridge caught fire. Then the bridge fire at 10:45. So no contradiction. However, the problem arises if the murder occurred after 10:45, making the bridge already on fire. But the autopsy allows for that. So unless there's another evidence that the body was moved after the bridge caught fire. Wait, Evidence 16: Crystal Sphere found near Dusky Bridge, which came from the victim's staff (Evidence 16 description). If the victim's staff (Evidence 9) had a crystal sphere, which was found near the bridge, perhaps implying that the body was moved after the sphere was lost. If the sphere was lost during the movement, and the sphere was half-covered in snow, then if the snow stopped at 10:50, the sphere would have been deposited before 10:50 to be half-covered. But this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, Testimony 4: Iris used the snowmobile to carry the body back. If the snow had stopped, maybe the snowmobile tracks would be different. But without evidence on that, it's hard to say.

Wait, the key contradiction is likely between Testimony 6 and Evidence 7. Testimony 6 says snow had stopped when the murder took place. Evidence 7 states that snow stopped at 10:50 PM. So if the murder was before 10:50, the snow was still ongoing, contradicting Testimony 6. But the murder could have been after 10:50. However, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) states the time of death was between 10-11 PM. So the murder could be anytime in that hour. Therefore, Testimony 6 is only contradicting if the murder was before 10:50. But how do we know the exact time?

Wait, Evidence 11 also says the body fell 10 ft after death. Maybe there's a correlation with the bridge fire. If the body fell after death, perhaps from the bridge. If the bridge was on fire, maybe that's connected. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, Testimony 3: dragging the body across the bridge, which was on fire (Evidence 15). If the bridge was on fire, as per the sketch, then dragging the body across would be impossible. So Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 15. But the sketch is from Larry's perspective. If the bridge was on fire when Larry saw it, which was during the crime night. If the murder happened before the bridge caught fire, then Testimony 3 is possible. But if the murder happened after the bridge caught fire, then dragging the body across is impossible. However, the exact timing isn't clear. The lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 (Evidence 7), causing the fire. If Iris dragged the body across after that, which would be after 10:45, then the bridge was on fire. But Larry's sketch shows the bridge on fire with a silhouette gliding over. So maybe the silhouette is Iris moving the body. But if the bridge was on fire, how could she drag the body across? Therefore, Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 15 and 7. But which one to pick? The user wants one pair. So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (dragged across the bridge) and Evidence 15 (bridge on fire). But how do we know the timing? The murder could have been before 10:45, allowing her to cross before the fire. But if the murder was after 10:45, then it's impossible. But the autopsy allows for both.

Alternatively, Testimony 6 (snow had stopped) vs Evidence 7 (snow stopped at 10:50). If Iris claims the snow had stopped when the murder occurred, but if the murder was before 10:50, then this is a lie. But how to confirm the murder time. However, Evidence 11's autopsy report says the body fell 10 ft after death. If the body fell from the bridge after it was on fire, then the murder happened after 10:45. But without more info, this is speculative.

Perhaps the most direct contradiction is between Testimony 3 (dragging the body across Dusky Bridge) and Evidence 7 (lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 causing fire), making the bridge impassable after that time. If the murder occurred after 10:45, then Testimony 3 is impossible. But the murder time is 10-11 PM, so it's possible the murder was after 10:45. Therefore, if Iris dragged the body across the bridge after the murder (which was after 10:45), the bridge was on fire, making it impossible. Therefore, Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 7 and 15. But the user wants one pair. The strongest contradiction would be between Testimony 6 and Evidence 7. Let's check:

Testimony 6: "By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped." Evidence 7: Snow stopped at 10:50 PM. If the murder happened at 10:50 or later, then the statement is true. If before, it's false. But the murder could have been any time between 10-11. So unless there's evidence that the murder occurred before 10:50, but how?

Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the body fell 10 ft after death. If the fall was from the bridge, which was struck by lightning at 10:45, then the murder must have occurred after 10:45. Because the bridge was intact before the lightning strike. If the body fell from the bridge after it was damaged, then the murder happened after 10:45. So if the murder was after 10:45, then according to Evidence 7, snow stopped at 10:50. Therefore, if the murder was between 10:45 and 10:50, snow was still falling, contradicting Testimony 6. If the murder was after 10:50, snow had stopped. Therefore, if the murder was between 10:45-10:50, Testimony 6 is false. If after 10:50, it's true. But how to determine the murder's exact time?

If the body fell from the bridge after death, and the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45, then the murder must have occurred after 10:45. Therefore, the murder time is between 10:45 and 11 PM. Therefore, the snow stopped at 10:50. So if the murder was between 10:45 and 10:50, snow was still falling, contradicting Testimony 6. If between 10:50-11, snow had stopped, so Testimony 6 is correct. So unless there's a way to pinpoint the murder time within that window.

But how? The fire started at 10:45 (lightning strike) and took 30 minutes to go out, ending around 11:15 PM. But the murder's time of death is up to 11 PM. So the murder could have been at 10:45-11 PM. So if the murder was between 10:45-10:50, snow was still falling, contradicting Testimony 6. If between 10:50-11 PM, snow had stopped. Therefore, Iris's Testimony 6 is only true if the murder occurred after 10:50. However, she says the snow had already stopped when the murder took place. If the murder was at 10:50 or later, it's true. But if before, it's false. But unless there's evidence that the murder happened before 10:50, there's no contradiction. However, the body was moved across the bridge which was on fire. If the murder happened after 10:45, the bridge was on fire, making Testimony 3 impossible. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (dragged across the bridge) and Evidence 15 (bridge on fire) and 7 (bridge struck at 10:45). But which evidence to pair with the testimony? The bridge being on fire is in Evidence 15 (Larry's Sketch). So Testimony 3 says she dragged the body across the bridge, but Larry's Sketch shows the bridge was on fire during the time. Therefore, Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 15. Alternatively, Evidence 7's lightning strike timing.

But the user wants only one pair. The most direct contradiction is Testimony 6 (snow stopped at murder time) vs Evidence 7 (snow stopped at 10:50). However, the murder could have been after 10:50. So unless there's evidence that the murder happened before 10:50, this isn't a contradiction. But if the murder happened after the snow stopped, then Testimony 6 is true. So this depends on the murder time. Without knowing the exact time, it's hard. 

Wait, another angle: Evidence 16 (Crystal Sphere) was found half-covered in snow. If the snow stopped at 10:50, and the sphere was deposited after the snow stopped, it wouldn't be covered. But it's half-covered, implying it was there while snow was falling. Therefore, the sphere was placed before 10:50. If the sphere is from the victim's staff (Evidence 16), then the staff was there before 10:50, implying the murder occurred before 10:50. Therefore, the murder happened before the snow stopped, contradicting Testimony 6. 

Ah, that's a solid contradiction. If the Crystal Sphere from the victim's staff was half-covered in snow, which stopped at 10:50, then the sphere must have been there during snowfall, i.e., before 10:50. Therefore, the murder occurred before 10:50, making Testimony 6 (snow had stopped) false. Therefore, Evidence 16 contradicts Testimony 6.

But Evidence 16 says the sphere was found half-covered in snow near Dusky Bridge. If the snow stopped at 10:50, then any snow accumulated after that would not cover it. So if the sphere was placed during snowfall (before 10:50), it would be partially covered. Therefore, the murder must have happened before 10:50, making Testimony 6 incorrect. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 6 and Evidence 16.

Wait, but Evidence 16 says the sphere came from the victim's staff (Evidence 9: the staff had a sword hidden, but also the sphere came from the staff). If the victim was killed and her staff lost the sphere, then the sphere was left at the bridge during the murder. If the sphere was half-covered, it means it was there during the snowfall (before 10:50), so the murder happened before 10:50. Therefore, Testimony 6, which claims snow had stopped during the murder, is false. Therefore, the contradiction is Testimony 6 and Evidence 16.

Alternatively, Evidence 16 and Testimony 6. Let me verify:

Testimony 6: "By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped."

Evidence 16: Crystal Sphere found half-covered in snow. If the murder occurred when snow had stopped (after 10:50), then the sphere would have been placed after the snow stopped, so it wouldn't be covered. But it's half-covered, meaning it was there while snow was falling (before 10:50). Therefore, the murder must have occurred before 10:50, making Testimony 6 false.

Thus, the contradiction is between Testimony 6 and Evidence 16. But Evidence 16's description says it was found half-covered in snow near Dusky Bridge the night of the crime. The snow stopped at 10:50, so if the sphere was placed there before 10:50, it would be partially covered. If the murder happened after 10:50, the sphere would have been placed after the snow stopped, so no coverage. Therefore, Testimony 6 is contradicted by Evidence 16.

But how does the sphere relate to the murder time? If the sphere came from the victim's staff (Evidence 16), and the victim was murdered, then the sphere was likely dropped during the murder or when the body was moved. If the murder happened after 10:50, the sphere wouldn't be covered, but it's half-covered. Therefore, the murder must have happened before 10:50, contradicting Testimony 6.

Yes, this seems like a solid contradiction. Therefore, the answer is {"evidence": 16, "testimony": 6}.

Let's analyze the provided information to find a contradiction between evidence and testimony. 

Testimony 6 by Iris states, "By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped." However, Evidence 16 (Crystal Sphere) was found half-covered in snow near Dusky Bridge. The Weather Data (Evidence 7) indicates snow stopped at 10:50 PM. For the sphere to be half-covered, it must have been deposited during snowfall, implying the murder occurred before 10:50 PM. This directly contradicts Testimony 6, which claims the snow had stopped when the murder happened. 

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 6}
Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. They want just one pair, ending with a JSON line.

First, I need to go through all the testimonies and evidences provided. Let's start by listing out the testimonies and the key points in each. The testimonies are from Maya, so all six (Testimony 0 to 6) are her account of the incident.

Testimony 0: She was passing through the garden to a prep room when it happened.
Testimony 1: Someone struck her over the head.
Testimony 2: She stumbled against the stone lantern.
Testimony 3: She screamed "Help me!"
Testimony 4: She saw a man behind her attacker by the light of the stone lantern.
Testimony 5: Something warm splashed over her.
Testimony 6: Then she lost consciousness.

Now, looking at the evidences, I need to find one that directly contradicts any of these testimonies. Let's go through each evidence:

Evidence 20: Stone Lantern - states it was not lit the night of the crime. 

Wait, Testimony 4 says Maya saw a man by the light of the stone lantern. But Evidence 20 says the stone lantern wasn't lit. That's a contradiction. If the lantern wasn't lit, she couldn't have seen the man by its light. So the testimony claims the lantern was providing light, but the evidence says it wasn't lit. That seems like a clear contradiction.

Let me check other possibilities to be thorough. For example, Testimony 2 says she stumbled against the stone lantern. Evidence 20 just says it wasn't lit, which doesn't contradict her stumbling against it. The contradiction is specifically about the light source.

Another possible angle: Testimony 5 mentions something warm splashing over her. Could that be related to any evidence? Maybe the blood on the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) or Dagger (Evidence 19), but the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says cause was blood loss from a stab in the back. But I don't see a direct contradiction here.

Testimony 4's mention of the stone lantern's light conflicting with Evidence 20 is the strongest contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be Evidence 20 and Testimony 4.

Let's analyze the testimonies and evidences provided.
Testimony 4 states, "I could see a man behind my attacker by the light of the stone lantern." However, Evidence 20 (Stone Lantern) explicitly states, "Was not lit the night of the crime." If the stone lantern was unlit, Maya could not have seen anything by its light, directly contradicting her testimony.
{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's take a look at this. The user provided a bunch of characters, evidence, and testimonies. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other, then output the pair in JSON.

First, I need to go through each testimony and see if any of them conflict with the evidence listed.

Looking at the testimonies from Maya:

Testimony 0: She came to lying on the Training Hall floor. Not sure what contradicts that yet.

Testimony 1: When she got back to the garden, it had changed. Maybe related to the crime scene?

Testimony 2: The killer cleaned up evidence for her sake. Maybe conflicts with something about the cleanup?

Testimony 3: The torches were lit and the body was gone. Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the time of death was between 10-11 PM. But the body fell 10 ft after death. If the body was moved, but the torches were lit and the body gone, maybe that's connected. But not sure.

Testimony 4: All the snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up. Evidence 20 is the stone lantern, which wasn't lit that night. Wait, the stone lantern wasn't lit, but the snow around it was cleaned up. If the lantern wasn't lit, maybe the snow wouldn't have melted, so cleaning it up would leave traces. But how does that contradict?

Wait, Evidence 7 (Weather Data) says there was snow from 7 PM to around 10:50 PM, and lightning until 11 PM. So snow was falling until almost 11. If the snow around the lantern was cleaned up, but after 10:50 PM, maybe the snow had stopped, so any new snow would not cover the cleaned area. But maybe if the cleanup happened during the snow, the cleaned area would get covered again. Hmm, maybe that's a contradiction. If Maya says the snow was cleaned up (Testimony 4), but the snow was falling until 10:50, then after that, if the cleanup happened after 10:50, there wouldn't be new snow to cover it. But if the cleanup happened before 10:50, then the snow would cover it again. So if the snow was cleaned up and remained clean, that suggests the cleanup happened after the snow stopped. But does the testimony mention when the cleanup happened?

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 3: "The torches were lit... And the body was gone." But according to Evidence 20 (Stone Lantern), the lantern wasn't lit. Wait, the Stone Lantern is in the garden (Evidence 20: "A lantern from the Inner Temple garden. Was not lit the night of the crime.") If the torches were lit (Testimony 3), but the stone lantern wasn't, maybe that's a contradiction? But the torches and the stone lantern might be different things. Maybe the torches refer to other light sources. Not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 5: Maya assumed the killer was a man because they did the work alone. But perhaps some evidence suggests the killer's gender isn't male? Not sure.

Wait, Evidence 10: Shichishito. It says "Had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon." Wait, the actual murder weapon is the dagger (Evidence 19?), but no. Wait, the murder weapon is the Shichishito, but according to Evidence 10, it's "not the murder weapon." Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says cause of death was a stab in the back. So if the Shichishito is the murder weapon, but Evidence 10 says it's not, but it has the victim's blood. Hmm, maybe that's conflicting. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Wait, maybe Testimony 2: "I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence..." But if the Shichishito (Evidence 10) was found with fingerprints and blood, that's evidence that wasn't cleaned up. So if the killer cleaned up, why is the Shichishito there? But maybe the Shichishito wasn't part of the cleaned evidence. Not sure.

Looking back, perhaps Testimony 4: "all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up" and Evidence 20: the stone lantern wasn't lit. If the lantern wasn't lit, perhaps there's no reason to clean the snow around it, unless the killer wanted to hide something. But maybe the contradiction is between the cleaned snow and the weather. Evidence 7 says snow stopped around 10:50 PM. If the snow was cleaned up after that, there's no new snow to cover the cleaned area. But if the murder happened around 10-11 PM (Evidence 11), and the cleanup happened after the snow stopped, then the cleaned area would remain. However, if the cleanup was done before the snow stopped, the snow would cover the area again. So if the snow around the lantern was cleaned up and stayed clean, that implies the cleanup was after 10:50 PM. But Maya's testimony doesn't specify the time of the cleanup. Maybe this isn't the contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 3: "The torches were lit... And the body was gone." If the body was moved after death, but the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the body fell 10 ft after death. So the body was moved after death. But if the body was gone from the crime scene (as per Testimony 3), but the autopsy says the body fell 10 ft after death, maybe there's a contradiction. Wait, maybe the body was found in a different location. If the body fell 10 ft, that suggests it was moved, but Testimony 3 says the body was gone. Hmm, perhaps not directly contradictory.

Wait, Evidence 16: Crystal Sphere found near Dusky Bridge with blood, came from the victim's staff (Evidence 9). The victim's staff (Evidence 9) has a sword hidden, which only Gumshoe and the protagonist know. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) has the victim's blood but is not the murder weapon. The actual murder weapon must be the dagger (Evidence 19), but it has blood that doesn't match the victim. So the murder weapon is unclear. But how does this relate to testimonies?

Maybe Testimony 5: Maya assumed the killer was a man because they did the work alone. But if the killer was, say, a woman, that contradicts. But which evidence points to the killer's gender? Not sure. Unless a female character's involvement is proven, but the evidence doesn't directly state that.

Alternatively, Testimony 4 (snow cleaned around the stone lantern) and Evidence 20 (stone lantern not lit). If the snow was cleaned, maybe the killer needed to access the lantern, but if it wasn't lit, perhaps there's no reason. But not sure if contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 3 says the torches were lit. If the stone lantern (Evidence 20) wasn't lit, but other torches were, that's not a contradiction. Unless the stone lantern is considered a torch. But the lantern is separate.

Wait, Evidence 7 mentions lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15) shows a bridge on fire with two drawstrings and a silhouette. The bridge fire could be from the lightning. The Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was found near Dusky Bridge with blood. Maybe Larry's sketch contradicts something, but not directly a testimony.

Hmm. Let's re-examine the testimonies and evidence again.

Testimony 4: Snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up. Evidence 20: Stone lantern wasn't lit. If the lantern wasn't lit, perhaps the snow around it wouldn't have melted. If the snow was cleaned up manually, maybe that's possible. But where's the contradiction?

Wait, the Weather Data (Evidence 7) says snow stopped around 10:50 PM. If the cleanup of the snow happened after 10:50, then the area would remain clean. But if the murder happened around 10 PM (Elise's death time is between 10-11 PM), the killer could have cleaned the snow after the snow stopped. So maybe no contradiction here.

Alternatively, Testimony 5: Maya assumes the killer is male because they worked alone. But if the real killer is female (like Iris or Morgan Fey), then this assumption is incorrect. However, the testimony is Maya's opinion, not a statement of fact. So contradiction would require evidence that the killer is female, but there's no direct evidence stating the killer's gender. So maybe not.

Wait, Evidence 12: Iris's Testimony says she rang the bell at 10 PM and was in her room until the murder was discovered. But the murder happened between 10-11 PM. If Iris was in her room, but maybe there's evidence she left. For example, the Note to Iris (Evidence 8) found in the Main Hall. If Iris was supposed to be in her room, but the note was found elsewhere, perhaps contradiction. But not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 3: The body was gone, but Evidence 11 says the body fell 10 ft after death. If the body was moved, but the autopsy says it fell, maybe a contradiction. Wait, the autopsy report says the body fell 10 ft after death. So after death, the body fell (perhaps pushed or fell from a height). But Testimony 3 says the body was gone from the scene. Maybe the body was moved again after the fall. But this might not be a direct contradiction.

Wait, let's look at Evidence 10: Shichishito is not the murder weapon but has victim's blood. The actual murder weapon is the dagger (Evidence 19), but its blood doesn't match. Wait, the autopsy says cause was a stab in the back. If the Shichishito is a sword, maybe the dagger was the weapon, but the blood doesn't match. So there's a contradiction here about the murder weapon. But how does this relate to testimonies?

Maya's testimonies don't mention the murder weapon directly. Maybe Testimony 2: Killer cleaned up evidence, but the Shichishito and dagger are still present. So if the killer cleaned up, why are those items there? But maybe they missed them. Not a direct contradiction.

Another angle: Testimony 0 says Maya was lying on the Training Hall floor when she came to. If there's evidence about the Training Hall's state, but not sure.

Wait, Evidence 16: Crystal Sphere from the victim's staff, found near Dusky Bridge. The staff (Evidence 9) has a hidden sword. If the sphere came from the staff, which was carried by Elise, then maybe the sphere was part of the staff. If the staff was at the crime scene, but the sphere was found near the bridge, that suggests the staff was moved. But how does this contradict testimony?

Alternatively, Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15) shows a bridge on fire with a silhouette gliding over. The fire could be from the lightning strike (Evidence 7). But if the bridge was on fire, maybe that's connected to the crime. But not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the autopsy report again. Evidence 11: Elise's Autopsy Report says time of death 10-11 PM, cause is stab in the back, and the body fell 10 ft after death. So after being stabbed, the body fell. If the body was found in a location that's 10 ft lower, but Testimony 3 says the body was gone, maybe the body was moved from where it fell. But that's not necessarily a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 3 says "the body was gone" when Maya returned to the garden. But the autopsy report indicates the body fell 10 ft after death, implying the original crime scene was elevated. If the body was moved from that spot, then Testimony 3's statement that the body was gone aligns with the autopsy. So maybe no contradiction here.

Let me look for clearer contradictions. For example, if a testimony claims someone was in a place at a certain time, but evidence shows otherwise.

Testimony 12: Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. The murder happened between 10-11 PM. If there's evidence placing Iris elsewhere during that time, that would contradict. Evidence 8: Note to Iris found in the Main Hall. If Iris was supposed to be in her room, but the note is in the Main Hall, maybe she went there. But that's circumstantial.

Alternatively, Evidence 18: Burnt Letter from Morgan Fey. Maybe incriminating her, but not directly contradicting testimony.

Wait, let's go back to Testimony 4: "all the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up." Evidence 20: Stone Lantern wasn't lit. If the lantern wasn't lit, perhaps the area around it wouldn't be a focal point, but the killer cleaned it. Maybe the killer wanted to hide something there. But how is that a contradiction with evidence?

Alternatively, the Weather Data (Evidence 7) shows snow stopped at 10:50 PM. If the snow was cleaned up after that, the area would stay clean. But if the murder occurred around 10 PM, and the cleanup happened before 10:50, then new snow would cover the cleaned area. Therefore, if the snow around the lantern was clean, the cleanup must have been after 10:50. But does any testimony indicate the time of the cleanup? Maya's Testimony 1 says when she got back to the garden, the place had changed. If she returned after the snow stopped, the cleaned area would be visible. But how does this contradict evidence?

Alternatively, the Stone Lantern (Evidence 20) wasn't lit, but if the torches were lit (Testimony 3), maybe the killer needed light, so they lit torches but not the lantern. Not a contradiction.

Wait, maybe Testimony 3 and Evidence 13 (Crime Photo). The Crime Photo (13) is of the courtyard where the murder happened. If the body was gone when Maya returned (Testimony 3), but the Crime Photo shows the courtyard with the body, that would contradict. But the description of Evidence 13 just says it's a photo of the courtyard; maybe the body is present in the photo. If so, then Testimony 3 (body gone) contradicts the photo (body present). But the user didn't provide the photo's details beyond "Click here for details", so we can't be sure. But the problem states we have to use given info. So if the Crime Photo is of the murder scene, and the body is there, but Testimony 3 says the body was gone, that's a contradiction. But since the user didn't specify the photo's content, maybe we can't assume that.

Alternatively, Testimony 2: Killer cleaned up evidence. But Evidence 10 (Shichishito) has fingerprints and blood. If the killer cleaned up, why is that evidence still there? But Testimony 2 is Maya's assumption, not a fact. So it's possible the killer didn't clean everything. Not a direct contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 10 says the Shichishito is not the murder weapon, but it has the victim's blood. The real murder weapon is the dagger (Evidence 19) but its blood doesn't match. So there's a contradiction between Evidence 10 and 19, but that's between evidence, not testimony.

Hmm. I'm struggling to find a direct contradiction between a testimony and evidence. Let's check again.

Testimony 5: Maya assumed the killer was a man because they worked alone. If the killer was a woman, this assumption is wrong. But unless there's evidence showing the killer's gender, this isn't a contradiction. For example, if Evidence 19's dagger has a woman's fingerprints, but the testimony says man. But the dagger's blood doesn't match the victim, so maybe the killer's blood is there. If the blood is from a woman, that contradicts Testimony 5. But the problem states Evidence 19 says the blood doesn't match the victim's, but doesn't say whose it is. So we can't assume.

Wait, Evidence 12: Iris's Testimony states she was in her room from 10 PM. If the murder happened at 10:45 PM (lightning strike time in Evidence 7), and the body fell 10 ft after death (Evidence 11), maybe Iris couldn't have done it if she was in her room. But unless there's evidence she left, this is possible but not a contradiction. For example, the Note to Iris (Evidence 8) found in the Main Hall suggests she might have been there, but it's not definitive.

Alternatively, Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15) shows a silhouette gliding over the bridge. If Iris was in her room, but the silhouette is her, that contradicts. But Larry's sketch is a drawing, not concrete evidence.

Wait, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) has blood and came from the victim's staff. The staff (Evidence 9) was carried by Elise. If the sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, that suggests the staff was there. But Elise was murdered in the courtyard (Evidence 13). So the staff being at the bridge implies movement, but how does that contradict testimony?

Perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 4 (snow cleaned around the stone lantern) and Evidence 20 (stone lantern not lit). If the lantern wasn't lit, there's no reason to clean the snow around it unless to hide something. But without more info, it's hard to see the contradiction.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 3 says the torches were lit. If the torches were lit, but the stone lantern (Evidence 20) wasn't, maybe that's a contradiction. But torches and lanterns are different. The stone lantern being unlit doesn't affect the torches.

Alternatively, the Weather Data (Evidence 7) mentions lightning at 10:45 PM. Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15) shows the bridge on fire. If the bridge caught fire due to lightning, then the fire would be natural. But the sketch shows a silhouette, implying someone was there. If Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room, but the silhouette is her, that contradicts. But this is speculative.

I think I need to focus on a clear contradiction. The most obvious one seems to be between Testimony 4 and Evidence 7. Testimony 4 says the snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up. Evidence 7 says snow fell until 10:50 PM. If the cleanup happened before 10:50, the snow would have covered the area again. Therefore, if the area was clean, the cleanup must have been after 10:50. But the murder occurred between 10-11 PM (Evidence 11). If the killer cleaned up after 10:50, which is possible, but if the murder happened around 10 PM, the cleanup timing is possible. So maybe no contradiction.

Wait, but Maya's Testimony 1 says when she got back to the garden, it had changed. If she returned after the snow stopped (after 10:50), then the cleaned area would remain. If she returned before, the snow would cover it. The timing is important here. But without knowing when Maya returned, we can't say.

Alternatively, let's consider Testimony 2: The killer cleaned up evidence. But Evidence 16 (Crystal Sphere) was found near the bridge. If the killer cleaned up, why leave the sphere? Maybe contradiction, but the sphere's presence isn't directly tied to the testimony.

I'm stuck. Let me try another approach. Look for testimony that directly states something opposite to what evidence says.

For example, if a testimony says "I did not touch the weapon," but evidence shows their prints on it. Like in the previous example, which was between Testimony 2 and Evidence 1.

In this case, is there any testimony that claims something contradicted by evidence?

Looking at the testimonies:

Maya's Testimonies 0-5 don't directly claim to have done anything, but describe the scene.

Wait, Testimony 2: "I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence..." If the killer did clean up, but there's evidence left (like the Shichishito, dagger, etc.), does that contradict? But the testimony says "cleaned up the evidence of what had happened," not necessarily all evidence. So maybe they cleaned some evidence but missed others. Not a direct contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 10 says the Shichishito had the suspect's fingerprints but isn't the murder weapon. So the suspect touched it, but it's not the weapon. If the real murder weapon is the dagger (Evidence 19), which has someone else's blood, perhaps the killer used the dagger but left the Shichishito as a red herring. But how does this relate to testimony?

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says the body was gone, but the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the body fell 10 ft after death. If the body was moved after falling, then the initial crime scene would be different. But this doesn't necessarily contradict.

Wait, Evidence 11 says the body fell 10 ft after death. So the murder occurred, then the body fell (maybe pushed off a ledge). Then, according to Testimony 3, when Maya returned, the body was gone. So after the body fell 10 ft, someone moved it again? That's possible, but not a contradiction.

I think I'm missing the obvious. Let's look for direct contradictions. For example, a testimony saying something happened at a certain time, but evidence shows a different time.

Testimony 12 (Iris's Testimony in Evidence 12) says she was in her room from 10 PM. But if there's evidence she was elsewhere, like the Note to Iris (Evidence 8) found in the Main Hall, implying she was there. But the note could have been dropped earlier.

Alternatively, the Burnt Letter (Evidence 18) from Morgan Fey might implicate her, but not directly contradict testimony.

Wait, Evidence 15 (Larry's Sketch) shows a silhouette on the bridge during the fire (which was at 10:45 PM). If Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room from 10 PM, but the silhouette is her, that's a contradiction. But how do we know the silhouette is her? It's just a sketch. Maybe not definitive.

Another possibility: Testimony 3 says the body was gone, but the autopsy report (Evidence 11) places the body at the crime scene (since the autopsy would be done on the body found there). If the body was moved but later found, then no contradiction. But if the body was gone and not found, that contradicts. But the autopsy report exists, meaning the body was found.

Wait, the autopsy report is for Elise Deauxnim, so the body was found. Testimony 3 says when Maya returned, the body was gone. But the body was later found, so perhaps someone moved it back? That's possible but not a direct contradiction.

I think I need to pick the most likely pair. The most obvious contradiction I can think of is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 7. Testimony 4 states that the snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up. Evidence 7 says snow stopped at 10:50 PM. If the killer cleaned the snow after 10:50, there's no new snow to cover it, so the cleanup would be visible. However, if the cleanup happened before 10:50, the snow would cover it again. Therefore, if Testimony 4 says the snow was cleaned up, implying it remained clean, that suggests the cleanup happened after the snow stopped. But the murder occurred between 10-11 PM (Evidence 11), so cleanup after 10:50 is possible. No direct contradiction here.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 5 says Maya assumed the killer was a man because they did the work alone. But the actual killer could be a woman, which would make her assumption wrong. However, unless there's evidence proving the killer is a woman, this is just an assumption. For example, if the Dagger (Evidence 19) has female DNA, but the problem doesn't state that. So not a contradiction based on given evidence.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for a testimony that directly states something opposite to evidence.

Wait, Testimony 0: Maya came to on the Training Hall floor. Is there evidence about the Training Hall's state? Not directly. Evidence 0-21 don't mention the Training Hall's condition.

Testimony 1: When she got back to the garden, it had changed. Evidence 13 (Crime Photo) shows the courtyard. If the photo shows the garden unchanged, but the testimony says it changed, that's a contradiction. But we don't know the photo's content.

Wait, Evidence 4: Hanging Scroll with Misty Fey's image obscured by gravy. Godot's description mentions her being in Japanese garb with Western tastes. Not related directly to testimonies.

Perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 3 (body gone) and Evidence 11 (body fell 10 ft after death). If the body fell 10 ft, perhaps into a different area, but Testimony 3 says it was gone. If the body fell but was still in the crime scene area, then Testimony 3 is contradicting. But without knowing the layout, hard to say.

Alternatively, Evidence 10 (Shichishito not the murder weapon but has prints) and Testimony 2 (killer cleaned up evidence). If the Shichishito was left behind, it contradicts the killer cleaning up. But Testimony 2 is Maya's assumption, not a fact. So maybe not.

Wait, the only concrete contradiction I can see is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 7. Testimony 4 says the snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up. Evidence 7 says snow fell until 10:50. If the cleanup was done before 10:50, the area would be covered in snow again. Therefore, for the cleaned area to remain visible, the cleanup must have occurred after 10:50 PM. But the murder's time of death is between 10-11 PM. If the killer committed the murder at, say, 10:30, then cleaned up after 10:50, that's possible. But if the murder occurred after 10:50, the cleanup could be done then. However, the autopsy report says time of death is 10-11 PM. So the cleanup timing is possible. Thus, no direct contradiction.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe the intended answer is Testimony 4 (snow cleaned around stone lantern) and Evidence 20 (stone lantern not lit). But how?

Wait, if the stone lantern wasn't lit, there's no reason for the snow around it to melt. Therefore, if the snow was cleaned manually, but the area would have been covered in snow again if cleaned before 10:50. So if the snow was cleaned after 10:50, it's possible. But the contradiction would be if the snow was cleaned before 10:50, leading to it being covered again, but Testimony 4 says it was cleaned. So if Maya observed cleaned snow, that implies the cleanup was after 10:50. But the murder happened at 10-11 PM. So maybe no contradiction. 

Alternatively, the cleaned snow around the stone lantern (Testimony 4) and the Weather Data (Evidence 7) showing snow stopped at 10:50. If the murder happened at 10 PM, and the cleanup was done before 10:50, then new snow would cover the cleaned area. But if the cleaned area was visible (as per Testimony 4), the cleanup must have been after 10:50. But the murder's time of death is up to 11 PM. So the killer could have committed the murder, then cleaned up after 10:50. So no contradiction.

I think I'm missing the correct pair. Let me try to look for another angle.

Evidence 10: Shichishito has the suspect's fingerprints but isn't the murder weapon. If the suspect's prints are on it, but the real weapon is the dagger, which has someone else's blood, then maybe the suspect handled the Shichishito but didn't use it to kill. But this relates to evidence, not testimony.

Wait, Testimony 2: Killer cleaned up evidence. If the Shichishito and dagger are still present, that contradicts the testimony. But the testimony says "evidence of what had happened," which could mean specific evidence. Maybe the killer cleaned up some evidence but not others. Not a contradiction.

Maybe the answer is Testimony 4 and Evidence 7. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, Testimony 3 (body gone) and Evidence 11 (body fell 10 ft after death). If the body fell 10 ft but was still at the crime scene, then Testimony 3's statement that the body was gone would contradict. For example, if the body fell into a lower area but was still present, but Maya says it was gone, that's a contradiction. But without knowing the layout, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the body fell 10 ft after death, implying the body was moved post-mortem. If Testimony 3 says the body was gone, that could mean it was moved again. But that's possible without contradiction.

I'm really not sure. The most likely answer I can think of is Testimony 4 (snow cleaned) and Evidence 7 (snow stopped at 10:50). If the cleanup was done before 10:50, the snow would cover it, making Testimony 4's statement impossible. Therefore, if the snow was cleaned and remained clean, cleanup must have been after 10:50. But the murder occurred up to 11 PM. So possible.

But unless there's a direct contradiction in timing, I'm not certain. The user's previous example had a direct contradiction between a testimony denying touching the weapon and evidence showing prints. Similarly, maybe here, a testimony denies something that evidence confirms.

Looking back, the testimonies are all from Maya. None of them directly deny actions but describe the scene.

Wait, Testimony 0: Maya was on the Training Hall floor. If there's evidence about her being elsewhere, but there's no such evidence listed.

Hmm. Perhaps the answer is Testimony 3 (body gone) and Evidence 11 (body fell 10 ft after death). If the body fell 10 ft but was still present at the crime scene, then Testimony 3's statement that it was gone contradicts. But if the body fell into another area (like a lower level), then being gone from the original spot makes sense. So maybe not a contradiction.

I think I've exhausted possibilities. The most plausible answer is Testimony 4 (snow cleaned around stone lantern) and Evidence 20 (stone lantern not lit). The contradiction being that if the lantern wasn't lit, there's no reason to clean the snow around it, implying the cleaned snow is evidence that contradicts the unlit lantern. But I'm not certain. However, given the previous example, the answer likely is a testimony directly conflicting with physical evidence. The only possible one I can see is Testimony 4 and Evidence 7, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says the torches were lit, but the Stone Lantern (Evidence 20) wasn't. If torches and lantern are different, no contradiction. But if the torches include the stone lantern, then it's a contradiction. But that's speculative.

I think the intended answer is Testimony 4 (snow cleaned around stone lantern) and Evidence 7 (snow stopped at 10:50). The contradiction being that if the snow was cleaned before 10:50, it would have been covered again, so the clean-up must have been after 10:50, which is during the murder timeline. But I'm not sure. Maybe the real answer is Testimony 3 and Evidence 13 (Crime Photo shows the body present). If the photo shows the body in the courtyard, but Testimony 3 says it was gone, that's a contradiction. But since the user didn't provide the photo's content, we can't use that.

Given the provided information, the most concrete contradiction I can find is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 10. Testimony 2 says the killer cleaned up evidence, but Evidence 10 (Shichishito) and 19 (Dagger) are still present. However, Testimony 2 is an assumption, not a fact. So that's not a direct contradiction.

Wait, another angle: Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she was in her room from 10 PM. The murder happened between 10-11 PM. If there's evidence she was elsewhere, like Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15) showing someone on the bridge at 10:45, that could contradict. But Larry's sketch is a silhouette, not identifiable. So not direct.

I think I'll have to go with Testimony 4 and Evidence 7. If the snow around the lantern was cleaned, but snow fell until 10:50, the cleanup must have occurred after that. The murder's time of death is up to 11 PM. So possible. Therefore, no contradiction. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 (body gone) and Evidence 11 (body fell 10 ft). If the body fell but was still present, then Testimony 3 is wrong. But without knowing the layout, can't confirm.

I'm stuck, but I'll choose Testimony 4 (snow cleaned) and Evidence 20 (lantern not lit), assuming that cleaning the snow around an unlit lantern is pointless, hence contradiction. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, the answer might be Testimony 3 (body gone) and Evidence 13 (Crime Photo shows body), but the photo's description is vague.

Wait, looking back at Evidence 10: "Had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon." So the suspect's prints are on the Shichishito, which isn't the murder weapon. The murder weapon is the dagger (Evidence 19), but it has someone else's blood. If a testimony says the suspect didn't touch any weapon, but Evidence 10 shows their prints on the Shichishito, that's a contradiction. But in the testimonies provided, none of Maya's testimonies say that the suspect didn't touch a weapon. The only testimony related to not touching a weapon is in the previous question's Phoenix's Testimony 2.

In this case, the testimonies are from Maya, not the suspect. So no direct contradiction there.

I think the intended answer is Testimony 4 and Evidence 7. The contradiction is that if snow stopped at 10:50 PM, any cleanup before that would be covered by snow, so the cleaned area must have been after 10:50. But the murder happened between 10-11 PM. If the cleanup was after 10:50, then the killer would have done it post-murder, which is possible. So no contradiction. Therefore, maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (killer assumed male) and Evidence 19 (dagger with non-victim blood, possibly female). But since the blood isn't matched, we can't confirm.

I'm really not sure. But given the previous example, the answer is likely a testimony that directly contradicts evidence. The only one I can think of is Testimony 4 and Evidence 7, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the answer is Testimony 3 (body gone) and Evidence 11 (body fell 10 ft), implying the body should be there but it's gone. 

Wait, Evidence 11 says the body fell 10 ft after death, meaning the body was moved from the original position. If Maya returned and the body was gone from its original place (where it was killed), but fell 10 ft into another location, that's possible. So Testimony 3 says the body was gone from the original spot, which aligns with Evidence 11. No contradiction.

I think I have to pick Testimony 4 and Evidence 7. The user's previous example was a testimony denying touching the murder weapon conflicting with evidence of fingerprints. Here, the only similar contradiction would be if a testimony denied something that evidence shows. But none of Maya's testimonies do that. The closest is Testimony 4 (snow cleaned) and Evidence 7 (snow timeline), but unsure.

After extensive analysis, I think the correct answer is Testimony 4 (snow cleaned around stone lantern) and Evidence 20 (stone lantern not lit). The contradiction is that if the lantern wasn't lit, there's no reason to clean the snow around it, implying the cleanup was unnecessary, thus contradicting the testimony. However, this is a stretch. Alternatively, the stone lantern being unlit means the area wasn't used, so cleaning it is suspicious. But without more info, this is speculative.

Alternatively, the real answer is Testimony 2 and Evidence 10. Testimony 2 says the killer cleaned up evidence, but Evidence 10 (Shichishito) is present with prints. But Testimony 2 is Maya's assumption, not a fact. So maybe not.

Given the time I've spent and not finding a clear answer, I'll go with Testimony 4 (snow cleaned) and Evidence 7 (snow stopped at 10:50). The contradiction is that if the cleanup happened before 10:50, the snow would cover it, making Testimony 4 impossible. Therefore, the cleanup must have been after 10:50, but the murder happened between 10-11 PM. However, this is possible, so no contradiction. Hence, I'm wrong.

Wait, the correct answer is likely Testimony 3 (body gone) and Evidence 11 (autopsy report stating the body fell 10 ft after death). If the body fell 10 ft but was still in the area, Testimony 3's claim that it's gone contradicts. But without knowing the layout, I can't confirm. 

Perhaps the intended answer is Testimony 5 (killer assumed male) and Evidence 19 (dagger with blood not matching victim, implying female killer). But this is speculative.

Given the options, I think the intended answer is Testimony 4 and Evidence 20. The contradiction is that the stone lantern wasn't lit, so cleaning the snow around it is unnecessary. Therefore, Maya's testimony about the cleaned snow contradicts the evidence that the lantern wasn't lit. This suggests the snow shouldn't have been cleaned if the lantern wasn't in use. So, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 20.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies from a legal case scenario, likely from the Ace Attorney series. My job is to analyze these elements and identify a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony.

First, I need to go through all the testimonies and cross-reference them with the evidence to spot inconsistencies. Let's start by listing out the testimonies and evidences that might be relevant.

Testimonies provided are Testimony 0 to Testimony 4, all given by Maya. Let's look at each:

- **Testimony 0**: "Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!" (Maya)
- **Testimony 1**: "The next morning, she looked around, but couldn't find anyone." (Maya)
- **Testimony 2**: "The next day, when the bridge was finally fixed, she was in the spare prep room." (Maya)
- **Testimony 3**: "That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!" (Maya)
- **Testimony 4**: "He found Pearly first, and cheered her right up!" (Maya)

Now, looking at the evidences. There's a lot here, so I need to focus on those that might relate to the testimonies. Let me scan through each evidence:

- **Evidence 7 (Weather Data)**: Mentions that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. The bridge was probably damaged, making it impassable. The snow lasted until around 10:50 PM, and lightning occurred until 11 PM. This might be relevant to the bridge's condition.

- **Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony)**: States that Iris rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and was in her room until the murder was discovered. This might be a timeline point.

- **Evidence 15 (Larry's Sketch)**: Depicts the bridge on fire with someone gliding over it. Could relate to the bridge's state that night.

- **Evidence 16 (Crystal Sphere)**: Found near Dusky Bridge with blood; came from the victim's staff.

- **Evidence 21 (Dusky Bridge Photo)**: Taken the morning after, which might show the bridge's condition.

Now, let's think about contradictions. Testimonies from Maya mention Pearly (Pearl Fey) being stuck on the Inner Temple side the night of the crime. Let's check if any evidence contradicts this.

Testimony 0 says Pearly was stuck on the Inner Temple side. However, if the bridge was damaged due to lightning at 10:45 PM (Evidence 7), then perhaps Pearly couldn't cross back. But other elements might contradict this.

Wait, Evidence 16 mentions the Crystal Sphere was found near Dusky Bridge, which is on the Inner Temple side. If Pearly was stuck there, maybe there's a connection. But I need to see if there's a direct contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 2 says that the next day, when the bridge was fixed, she (Pearly) was in the spare prep room. If the bridge was fixed the next day, that aligns with being stuck until then. So maybe no contradiction there.

Looking at Testimony 3: Godot arrived at Inner Temple for the first time when the bridge was fixed. If the bridge was out due to lightning, how did Godot arrive there? Wait, maybe that's a point. If the bridge was destroyed until the next day, then how did Godot get to the Inner Temple on the night of the crime? But Testimony 3 says "That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!" which could be the next day when the bridge was fixed. But maybe there's a contradiction here.

Wait, Evidence 7 says lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM, which would have damaged it. The murder occurred between 10-11 PM (Evidence 11: Elise's Autopsy Report). So if the bridge was damaged by lightning at 10:45, and the murder happened around that time, then anyone on the Inner Temple side (like Pearly) would be stuck there until the bridge was fixed the next day (Testimony 2). 

But what about Godot's arrival? Testimony 3 says he arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time when the bridge was fixed. If the bridge was only fixed the next day, then Godot couldn't have been there earlier. But maybe other evidence contradicts this.

Wait, maybe another angle. Let's look at Testimony 0: Pearly was stuck on the Inner Temple side. If someone else was also there, like Godot, but according to Testimony 3, Godot arrived there for the first time when the bridge was fixed (the next day). But if the bridge was out, how did he get there earlier? Unless he was already there. Wait, no, Testimony 3 says "That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!" implying that he only arrived after the bridge was fixed. So if Pearly was stuck there, and Godot wasn't there until the bridge was fixed, how did he find Pearly first (Testimony 4)? If the bridge wasn't fixed until the next day, then Godot couldn't have arrived until then. So Testimony 4 says he found Pearly first when he arrived. But if Pearly was stuck there all night, then when Godot arrives the next day (after the bridge is fixed), he finds her. That seems plausible. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a contradiction in someone's location. Let me check other evidence. For example, Evidence 16: Crystal Sphere found near Dusky Bridge with blood. If Pearly was stuck on the Inner Temple side, maybe she was there, but the Crystal Sphere is part of the victim's staff (Evidence 9). Wait, Evidence 16 says the Crystal Sphere came from the victim's staff. If the victim (Elise Deauxnim) was murdered in the courtyard (Evidence 13), then the staff's sphere being near the bridge might indicate the staff was moved. But how does that tie to the testimonies?

Alternatively, let's look at Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12): She was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. But if the murder happened between 10-11 PM, and Iris was in her room, then she couldn't have been near the bridge. But how does that relate to Maya's testimonies?

Wait, another angle: The autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the victim's body fell 10 feet after death. If the crime occurred in the courtyard (Crime Photo 13), how did the body fall 10 feet? Maybe from a height. The bridge? Dusky Bridge's photo (Evidence 21) might show that. If the victim was stabbed on the bridge and fell, but the bridge was damaged by lightning. However, the autopsy time is between 10-11 PM, and the lightning struck at 10:45. So maybe the murder happened around the time the bridge was struck.

Wait, but let's go back to the main task: find a contradiction between evidence and testimony. Let me think again.

Testimony 0 says Pearly was stuck on the Inner Temple side that night. But maybe there's evidence that Pearly was elsewhere. For example, Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) says Iris was in her room from 10 PM. But that's Iris, not Pearly. 

Alternatively, Testimony 2 states that the next day when the bridge was fixed, she (Pearly) was in the spare prep room. If the bridge was fixed the next day, that's consistent. But perhaps another evidence contradicts Pearly's location.

Wait, Evidence 18 (Burnt Letter) mentions orders from Morgan Fey. If Morgan is in solitary confinement (Character 12), maybe she orchestrated something. But how does that tie to testimonies?

Alternatively, Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) says it was received before the lights out bell the night of the crime. The hood is supposed to protect from evil spirits. If Iris rang the bell at 10 PM (Evidence 12), then the hood was received before that. But how does that contradict a testimony?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look at the murder weapon. Evidence 10 (Shichishito) is the apparent murder weapon with the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, but it's stated that it's not the actual murder weapon. The real weapon might be the dagger (Evidence 19), but the blood doesn't match the victim. Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says cause of death was a stab in the back. The dagger (Evidence 19) has blood that doesn't match the victim, so maybe the real weapon is elsewhere. But how does this relate to testimonies?

Alternatively, let's consider Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15). It shows the bridge on fire with someone gliding over. The weather data (Evidence 7) mentions lightning causing a fire. If the bridge was on fire, then maybe someone used the drawstrings to glide over, as per the sketch. But Testimony 0 says Pearly was stuck on the Inner Temple side. If someone glided over the bridge (like the silhouette in the sketch), maybe that person could have gotten to the other side, contradicting the idea that Pearly was stuck. But how does that tie in?

Alternatively, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was found near the bridge, which came from the victim's staff (Evidence 9). If the staff was at the bridge, maybe the victim was there, but the autopsy says the body was in the courtyard. Contradiction here? The victim's staff (Evidence 9) was carried by Elise when she was alive, but the Crystal Sphere from the staff is found near the bridge. So maybe the victim was at the bridge, but the body was found in the courtyard. The autopsy says the body fell 10 feet after death. If she was stabbed on the bridge (which collapsed or was damaged by lightning), then her body fell into the courtyard? That might make sense, but I'm not sure if that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 0: Pearly was stuck on the Inner Temple side. If the bridge was destroyed, how did she get there in the first place? Maybe she was already there before the bridge was damaged. The lightning struck at 10:45 PM (Evidence 7). If she was on the Inner Temple side before that, she'd be stuck. But if there's evidence that she was elsewhere, that would contradict. However, I don't see such evidence.

Wait, Testimony 2 says the next day when the bridge was fixed, she was in the spare prep room. The spare prep room is likely on the main temple side. So after the bridge was fixed, she crossed back. That's consistent. So maybe no contradiction there.

Wait, let's check the timeline again. The murder happened between 10-11 PM. The bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM, causing it to be impassable. So if Pearly was on the Inner Temple side after 10:45, she couldn't leave. Testimony 0 says she was stuck there that night, which aligns with the bridge being out. So that's consistent.

But maybe there's a contradiction with another testimony. Let's see Testimony 3: "That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!" This would be when the bridge was fixed the next day. But if Godot arrived then, how did he find Pearly (Testimony 4)? If Pearly was stuck there until the bridge was fixed, then when Godot arrived via the fixed bridge, he found her there. That makes sense.

Hmm. I'm not seeing a clear contradiction yet. Let me check other evidences.

Evidence 10 (Shichishito) says it's not the murder weapon, but it has the victim's blood and suspect's prints. So the real weapon is elsewhere. The dagger (Evidence 19) has blood not matching the victim, so maybe another weapon. But how does this relate to testimonies?

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere. Let's check Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12): She was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. But if the murder happened in the courtyard (Evidence 13), and Iris was in her room, which is presumably in the temple, maybe she couldn't have witnessed anything. But how does this contradict Maya's testimonies?

Alternatively, consider Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15): The bridge on fire with someone gliding over. If the bridge was on fire at the time of the murder, but the weather data says the snow stopped around 10:50 PM, and lightning until 11 PM. The fire from the lightning could have started the bridge fire. If Larry's sketch is accurate, then someone was on the bridge, but if the bridge was destroyed, maybe that's impossible. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the key contradiction is between Testimony 0 (Pearly stuck on Inner Temple) and some evidence that suggests she was elsewhere. But I don't see such evidence. Alternatively, maybe the fact that the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) from the victim's staff was found near Dusky Bridge implies that the victim was there, but the autopsy says the body was in the courtyard. If the victim was killed on the bridge, but the body was moved, that could be a point. But how does that contradict a testimony?

Alternatively, maybe the victim's staff (Evidence 9) has a hidden sword, but the murder weapon was a stab in the back (Evidence 11). The Shichishito (Evidence 10) is not the murder weapon. The dagger (Evidence 19) has non-matching blood. So the real murder weapon is the sword inside the staff (Evidence 9). But if the staff's sword was used, then the Shichishito's prints are a red herring. But how does this relate to a testimony?

Wait, perhaps Testimony 0: Pearly was on the Inner Temple side. If the staff's Crystal Sphere was found near the bridge (Evidence 16), and the staff was with the victim, then maybe the victim was on the bridge. But the body was found in the courtyard. So if the victim was killed on the bridge (leading to the sphere falling there), and the body fell 10 ft into the courtyard (per autopsy), that's possible. But does that contradict any testimony?

Alternatively, the contradiction could be between Testimony 3 and some evidence. Testimony 3 says Godot arrived at Inner Temple for the first time when the bridge was fixed. But perhaps there's evidence that Godot was there earlier. For example, if the Magatama (Evidence 1) shows he had a secret, but that's not direct. Or maybe the burnt letter (Evidence 18) from Morgan Fey could implicate him. Not sure.

Wait, Evidence 4 (Hanging Scroll) mentions Misty Fey's image obscured by gravy, and Godot described her in a certain way. If Godot had prior knowledge of Misty Fey, maybe he had been to the temple before, contradicting Testimony 3's claim that he arrived for the first time after the bridge was fixed. But this is speculative. The Hanging Scroll's description is about Misty Fey, but unless there's evidence that Godot was there before, this might not hold.

Alternatively, the weather data (Evidence 7) mentions lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM. The autopsy (Evidence 11) says time of death between 10-11 PM. If the victim was killed after the bridge was struck, then the murderer couldn't have escaped via the bridge unless they used another method, like the drawstrings in Larry's sketch. But how does that relate to a testimony?

Wait, Testimony 0 states Pearly was stuck on the Inner Temple side. If the bridge was destroyed, the only way to leave would be via the drawstrings or another route. But if Pearly was there, and the murderer used the drawstrings to glide over (as per Larry's sketch), maybe Pearly saw something. But Maya's testimony says Pearly was stuck there, but maybe evidence shows she wasn't. However, I don't see evidence directly contradicting that.

Alternatively, Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she was in her room from 10 PM. If Iris is a nun at the temple, maybe her room is on the main temple side. If the murder happened on the Inner Temple side, then the killer had to be someone who was there. But Pearly was stuck there, so maybe she's a suspect. But the Shichishito has the suspect's fingerprints, but it's not the murder weapon. The real weapon is the staff's sword. If the staff was with the victim, then maybe the prints on the Shichishito are irrelevant.

Hmm. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 12. Wait, Testimony 0 is about Pearly, Evidence 12 is about Iris. No direct link.

Wait, let me think again. The user's previous example had a testimony denying touching the murder weapon, but evidence showing prints. That's a direct contradiction. So perhaps here, there's a testimony that claims something, but evidence directly contradicts it.

Looking at the testimonies again:

Testimony 0: Pearly was stuck on Inner Temple side.

Is there any evidence that Pearly was elsewhere? For example, if there's evidence that she was on the main temple side. Evidence 2 is the temple map, but not sure. Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) was received before 10 PM. If Pearly was on the Inner Temple side, maybe she couldn't have received the hood if it was given on the main side. But no, the hood is Iris's, and she's a nun on the main side. So if Pearly was stuck on Inner Temple, she wouldn't have access to the hood. But Evidence 6 says the hood was received before the lights out bell (10 PM). If Pearly was on the Inner Temple side after 10:45 PM when the bridge was struck, but before that, she could have been on the main side. Wait, the timeline: the bridge was struck at 10:45 PM. So if Pearly was on the Inner Temple side before 10:45, she could have gotten stuck there after the bridge was damaged. But how does that relate to the hood? Unless the hood was given to her after she was stuck, which would be impossible if the bridge was out. But Evidence 6 says the hood was received before the lights out bell at 10 PM. So if Pearly received the hood before 10 PM, she could have been on the main side, then crossed to the Inner Temple side before the bridge was destroyed at 10:45. That's possible. So no contradiction here.

Alternatively, Testimony 1: "The next morning, she looked around, but couldn't find anyone." If Pearly was on the Inner Temple side, and the bridge was out, then in the morning after the bridge was fixed, she looked around but found no one. But maybe evidence shows someone was there. For example, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) found near the bridge implies someone was there. But that's circumstantial.

Alternatively, Testimony 4: "He found Pearly first, and cheered her right up!" If Godot arrived after the bridge was fixed and found Pearly, that's consistent. No contradiction.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (Pearly stuck on Inner Temple) and Evidence 15 (Larry's Sketch). The sketch shows a silhouette gliding over the bridge, which was on fire. If Pearly was stuck on the Inner Temple side, maybe she is the silhouette, implying she escaped, contradicting Testimony 0. But the sketch is from the night of the crime, and the bridge was on fire then. If Pearly was stuck, she couldn't leave, but the sketch shows someone gliding over, perhaps escaping. If that someone is Pearly, that would contradict Testimony 0. But the sketch is from Larry's perspective, and it's a silhouette. So maybe Larry's Sketch contradicts Maya's Testimony 0 by suggesting someone left the Inner Temple side via the drawstrings, implying Pearly wasn't stuck. But this is a stretch. The sketch might depict the murderer escaping, not Pearly.

Alternatively, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the body fell 10 feet after death. If the murder happened in the courtyard (Crime Photo 13), which is ground level, how did the body fall 10 feet? Maybe from the bridge. If the bridge is elevated, and the body fell from there into the courtyard, then the murder happened on the bridge. But the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45, which could have caused the fire and collapse. So the victim was on the bridge when it was struck, leading to her falling into the courtyard. This aligns with the autopsy. But how does this contradict a testimony?

Perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (Pearly stuck on Inner Temple) and the fact that the bridge was only destroyed at 10:45 PM. If Pearly was on the Inner Temple side before 10:45, she could have left before the bridge was destroyed. But Testimony 0 says she was stuck "that night," which could mean after the bridge was destroyed. So if she was there after 10:45, she was stuck. No contradiction.

Wait, maybe another angle. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) has the suspect's fingerprints but isn't the murder weapon. The real weapon is the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9). If the suspect's prints are on the Shichishito, which wasn't used, then maybe the testimony denying involvement is contradicted. But the testimonies here are from Maya, not the suspect. The suspect's identity isn't clear here. The previous example had Phoenix's testimony contradicted by evidence with his prints.

Alternatively, looking at the testimonies, maybe one of Maya's testimonies contradicts an evidence. For instance, Testimony 3 says Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time when the bridge was fixed. If there's evidence that Godot was there earlier, like the Magatama (Evidence 1) indicating he has a secret, but that's not direct. Or perhaps the Hanging Scroll (Evidence 4) described by Godot implies he had prior knowledge, suggesting he was there before. If Godot had been to the Inner Temple before the bridge was fixed, that would contradict Testimony 3. But the Hanging Scroll's description says Godot described Misty Fey's image, which he could have done without being there, maybe through prior knowledge.

Alternatively, the burnt letter (Evidence 18) from Morgan Fey, who is in solitary confinement, orders something. If the letter was sent to someone at the temple, perhaps Godot, implying he was involved earlier, contradicting Testimony 3. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, the Dagger (Evidence 19) has blood that doesn't match the victim. If the real murder weapon is the staff's sword, and the Shichishito is a red herring, maybe a testimony about the weapon contradicts this. But the testimonies here don't mention the weapon.

I'm struggling to find a direct contradiction. Let me recap the key points:

- The bridge was damaged by lightning at 10:45 PM, making it impassable.
- Pearly was stuck on the Inner Temple side that night (Testimony 0).
- The next day, when the bridge was fixed, she was in the spare prep room (Testimony 2).
- Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time when the bridge was fixed (Testimony 3) and found Pearly (Testimony 4).
- The victim's staff's Crystal Sphere was found near the bridge (Evidence 16), implying the staff was there.
- The autopsy says the victim was stabbed in the back and fell 10 ft after death, which could align with falling from the bridge into the courtyard.

Perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (Pearly stuck on Inner Temple) and the Crystal Sphere's location. If Pearly was stuck there, and the Crystal Sphere from the victim's staff is there, maybe Pearly moved the staff, implying she wasn't stuck. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, if the staff was in the Inner Temple, and the victim was killed there, but the body was found in the courtyard, indicating movement, which Pearly could have done if she was stuck there. No direct contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she was in her room from 10 PM. If the murder happened in the courtyard, which is outside, Iris couldn't have witnessed it. But that's not a contradiction with Maya's testimonies.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the timeline. The murder occurred between 10-11 PM. The bridge was struck at 10:45 PM. If Pearly was on the Inner Temple side after 10:45, she was stuck. But if the murder occurred there, and the bridge was the only way out, then the murderer must have been someone who was there before the bridge was destroyed. Pearly being stuck there would make her a potential suspect, but the Shichishito has someone else's prints. However, the Shichishito isn't the murder weapon.

Wait, Evidence 10 says the Shichishito had the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints but is not the murder weapon. The real murder weapon is the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9), which only the detective and the protagonist know about. So the prints on the Shichishito are irrelevant. If the real weapon is the staff's sword, then the murderer had access to the staff. The staff was carried by the victim (Evidence 9), so the murderer took it from her and used it. If Pearly was stuck there, maybe she's the one who took the staff, but there's no direct evidence of that.

Alternatively, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) from the staff was found near the bridge, indicating the staff was there. If the victim was killed on the bridge (leading to the sphere falling off), then the body fell into the courtyard. This aligns with the autopsy. But how does this contradict a testimony?

Perhaps the contradiction is that Testimony 0 says Pearly was stuck on the Inner Temple side, but if the bridge was destroyed at 10:45 PM, and the murder happened around the same time, Pearly would have been there during the murder. But the real murderer would also have been there, implying Pearly might have seen something. However, Testimony 1 says she looked around the next morning and found no one. If the murderer was also stuck there, they should have been present, but she didn't find anyone, which might suggest the murderer escaped another way, contradicting the bridge being the only access. But if the murderer used the drawstrings (as per Larry's sketch) to glide over, they could have left before the bridge was destroyed. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, the burnt letter (Evidence 18) from Morgan Fey might implicate someone, but without knowing its contents, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 4. Testimony 3 says Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time when the bridge was fixed. However, Evidence 4's description mentions Godot describing Misty Fey's image on the Hanging Scroll, which was obscured by gravy. If Godot had never been to the Inner Temple before, how could he describe the scroll in detail? This implies he had prior knowledge or had seen it before, contradicting Testimony 3. So Evidence 4 contradicts Testimony 3 because Godot's description of the Hanging Scroll suggests he had seen it before arriving for the first time as per Testimony 3.

Yes, this seems like a valid contradiction. If Godot described the Hanging Scroll's appearance (clad in Japanese garb with Western elements) despite Testimony 3 stating he arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time after the bridge was fixed, then he must have seen the scroll before, which would mean he was there earlier, contradicting the testimony.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 3 states that Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time when the bridge was fixed. However, Evidence 4 describes Godot commenting on the Hanging Scroll of Misty Fey, which is located in the Inner Temple. For Godot to describe the scroll's details, he must have seen it prior to his supposed first arrival, contradicting the testimony.

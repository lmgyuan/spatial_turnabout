Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, the task is to find a contradiction between one of the evidences and one of the testimonies provided. The user wants only one pair, with the answer in JSON at the end.

First, let's list out the testimonies. All the testimonies here are from Gumshoe (Character 2, Detective). Let's go through each one:

Testimony 0: Gumshoe says he examined the crime scene. Not immediately contradictory, but maybe a detail here could clash with evidence.

Testimony 1: He found a memo next to the victim's body. Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo, but that's a memo on her cell phone. Wait, the memo in Testimony 1 is written on paper. Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood writing, which might be the memo mentioned here. Hmm.

Testimony 2: The memo had "Maya" written in blood. So the victim wrote "Maya" in her own blood (Testimony 3 says the blood was the victim's). But Evidence 3 is a receipt with letters in blood on the back. The receipt is for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder. Wait, if the receipt is the memo, then the word "Maya" is written on a receipt. But the receipt's description doesn't mention "Maya" specifically, just letters in blood. However, Testimony 2 says the word "Maya" was clearly written. So maybe the receipt (Evidence 3) is that memo. Then, the receipt's purchase date is the day before the murder. But if the victim wrote "Maya" in her own blood on the receipt, that would mean the receipt was present at the murder, which was on 9/5 at 9 PM. But the receipt was purchased the day before (9/4?), so that's possible. But where's the contradiction?

Wait, looking at Evidence 5: Mia's Autopsy Report says the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, death instantaneous, but then also says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." So there's a contradiction within the autopsy report itself? But that's not between evidence and testimony. 

Wait, Testimony 5: Gumshoe claims that "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!" But according to the autopsy report (Evidence 5), Mia's death was instantaneous, meaning she wouldn't have had time to write anything after being hit. If she was killed instantly, then writing "Maya" in blood after the fatal blow would be impossible. So Testimony 5 (which says the victim wrote the killer's name before dying) contradicts Evidence 5 (which says death was instantaneous, but also mentions she may have lived a few minutes). Wait, the autopsy report has conflicting info: "Death was instantaneous. Death caused by a single blow. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." That's a contradiction within the evidence. But maybe the key point here is that if the death was instantaneous, the victim couldn't have written anything post-injury. But the testimony says she wrote the name before dying, which if the death was instantaneous, she wouldn't have had time. However, the autopsy report says two things: death was instantaneous, but may have lived a few minutes. That's conflicting. But if we take the first part, that death was instantaneous, then Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name before dying) is contradicted because she couldn't have done that. However, the autopsy report also says she may have lived a few minutes, which would allow time. So maybe this is not the contradiction. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at Testimonies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. If the memo was written in the victim's blood (Testimony 3), but the receipt (Evidence 3) is a receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before, then the receipt was already present at the scene. But the receipt has blood on it, written by the victim. If the receipt was purchased the day before, then the blood writing would have to be done on the day of the murder. But how does that contradict? Maybe not.

Wait, Evidence 2 is Glass Shards from a broken light stand. Evidence 3 is a receipt for a glass light stand bought the day before. So the light stand was purchased the day before, then broken into shards (Evidence 2). If the receipt was used to write "Maya" in blood, then the receipt's purchase date being the day before is okay. But maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Let's look at Testimony 5 again: "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!" If the victim's death was instantaneous (from the autopsy report's first line), then she couldn't have written anything. But the autopsy report also says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." So the report itself is conflicting. However, the testimony says the victim wrote the name before dying. If the cause of death was a single blow leading to instantaneous death, then the victim wouldn't have time to write. But if she lived a few minutes, maybe she could. But the presence of both statements in the autopsy report complicates things. However, maybe the key contradiction is between Testimony 5 and the first part of Evidence 5 (death was instantaneous). If the testimony says she wrote the name before dying, but the autopsy says death was instantaneous, then there's a contradiction. Because if death was instantaneous, she couldn't have written anything after the blow. Therefore, Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name) contradicts Evidence 5 (death instantaneous). But wait, the testimony says "before she died", so maybe she wrote it before the fatal blow? But that wouldn't make sense. The scenario is that the victim was attacked, then wrote the name as she was dying. But if the death was instantaneous, she couldn't have done that. So Testimony 5 and Evidence 5's initial statement conflict. 

Therefore, the contradiction would be between Testimony 5 and Evidence 5. But let's check again. Evidence 5: "Time of death: 9/5 at 9:00PM. Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Wait, the last line says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." So the report is conflicting. The first part says death was instantaneous, the second part says may have lived a few minutes. That's conflicting in the evidence itself. But how does that relate to the testimony? Testimony 5 claims that she wrote the name before dying, which requires her to have survived the initial blow long enough to write. If the autopsy says death was instantaneous, then that's impossible. But the autopsy also suggests she might have lived a few minutes. However, the testimony is from Gumshoe, who is asserting that the victim wrote the name, which would require her to have survived for a bit. The contradiction here could be between Testimony 5 (victim wrote the name) and the first part of Evidence 5 (death was instantaneous). Even though the autopsy report has conflicting info, the testimony states that the victim wrote the name before dying, which would be impossible if death was instantaneous.

So the pair would be Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 5 (Gumshoe's statement that the victim wrote the killer's name before dying). But wait, the autopsy report says both things. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and the first part of the autopsy report (instantaneous death). Alternatively, maybe another contradiction exists.

Looking elsewhere: Evidence 1 is The Thinker, the murder weapon, a clock statue with gears removed. Testimony 0: Gumshoe examined the scene. Not sure. Testimony 4: Blood on the victim's finger. Which would make sense if she wrote in blood. But not a contradiction.

Alternatively, the memo mentioned in Testimony 1 and 2 is written in blood on a receipt (Evidence 3). The receipt is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken light stand. So the receipt's existence (purchased the day before) and the broken glass might align. Not a contradiction here.

Wait, Testimony 1 says the memo was found next to the victim's body. Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood writing. So if the receipt is the memo, then that's consistent. The receipt's purchase date is the day before, which is okay. The blood on it is the victim's (Testimony 3). So no contradiction here.

Another angle: Evidence 9 is May Testimony: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." If the victim dodged and ran, but the autopsy says death was instantaneous from a single blow. But that's a possible contradiction between Evidence 9 and the autopsy report. However, Evidence 9 is testimony from April May (Character 4), not part of the provided testimonies here. The testimonies to consider are only Testimonies 0-5 from Gumshoe.

Wait, the user provided a list of testimonies (Testimony 0-5) all from Gumshoe. So we must find a contradiction between one of those testimonies and one of the evidences (0-14).

So circling back, Testimony 5: "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!" If the autopsy (Evidence 5) states that death was instantaneous, then writing after the fatal blow would be impossible. But the autopsy also says she may have lived a few minutes. So the evidence itself is contradictory. However, the testimony's claim (she wrote the name) is contradicted by the first part of the evidence (instantaneous death), but supported by the second part (lived a few minutes). So the contradiction is within the evidence, but we need a contradiction between evidence and testimony. Since the testimony is making a definitive statement that she wrote the name before dying, and the autopsy's first part says death was instantaneous, there's a contradiction. Even though the autopsy has conflicting info, the testimony's assertion contradicts the first part of the autopsy.

Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 5 states that "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!" However, Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) initially claims "Death was instantaneous" from a single blunt force trauma. If death were instantaneous, Mia could not have physically written anything after the fatal blow. This directly contradicts Testimony 5's assertion that she wrote the name before dying, as there would be no time for such an action if death occurred instantly. While the autopsy report later mentions she "may have lived for a few minutes," the primary contradiction lies between the testimony and the initial determination of instantaneous death.
{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to look through the provided evidence and testimonies to find contradictions. The goal is to find one pair where a testimony conflicts with evidence.

Starting with the testimonies. Testimony 4 by April May mentions "The Thinker" statue clock as the murder weapon. She says, "That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?" So she's identifying the statue as the weapon used to hit the victim.

Now looking at Evidence 1: "The Thinker" is described as the murder weapon, a statue clock made by Larry Butz. However, the evidence also states that "the clock's gears have been removed." If the gears were removed, the statue might not function as a clock anymore, but does that affect its use as a weapon? Maybe not directly. However, another angle is the autopsy report. 

Evidence 5 is Mia's Autopsy Report, which says the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, and death was instantaneous. But then in the description, it adds, "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." That seems contradictory on its own, but maybe that's not related to the testimony. 

Wait, Testimony 1 and 3 from April May: She says the victim dodged the first attack, ran to the right, then was chased and hit. However, if the murder weapon is The Thinker with gears removed, maybe there's an issue with the time of death. But the autopsy report says time of death was 9:00 PM. Let me check the receipt. Evidence 3 is a receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken light stand. If the receipt is for that light stand, and the glass is broken, perhaps the real murder weapon was the glass stand, not the statue? But April says it was The Thinker.

Wait, but Evidence 1 says The Thinker was the murder weapon. However, the receipt and glass shards might suggest that the light stand was involved. If the Thinker's gears were removed, maybe it couldn't have been the actual weapon? Or perhaps the fact that the light stand was purchased the day before and then broken implies it was used. But the testimony says the statue was the weapon. If the evidence shows that the glass shards are from the light stand, and the receipt shows it was purchased, but the autopsy says the cause was a single blow from a blunt object. The Thinker is a blunt object, but the glass stand might have been broken and used as a sharp object? Maybe not. Alternatively, if the Thinker's gears were removed, perhaps it was too light to cause the blunt force trauma, but that's speculative. 

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 1 by April: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." However, the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) might show the layout of the office. If the victim ran to the right, maybe there's a contradiction in the physical layout versus the testimony. But I don't have details on the floor plans. 

Another angle: Testimony 3 says "she hit her with that weapon! I saw it!" referring to The Thinker. But if the gears were removed, maybe the statue was not in a position to be used as a weapon. Or perhaps the autopsy's mention that death was instantaneous vs. living a few minutes. Wait, the autopsy report itself seems conflicting. The first line says death was instantaneous, then adds "may have lived a few minutes after being hit." That's a contradiction in the evidence, but the question asks for a contradiction between evidence and testimony. 

Alternatively, Testimony 4 where April identifies The Thinker as the weapon. However, the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) and Receipt (Evidence 3) might suggest the light stand was the actual weapon. If the receipt is for the light stand purchased the day before, and it's broken (shards), maybe the real weapon was the light stand, but April testifies it was the statue. That would contradict. So Evidence 3 (receipt) and Testimony 4? But the receipt's description says "letters written in blood on the back," which might not directly relate. Wait, the receipt's main point is that it's for a glass light stand bought the day before. The glass shards are from a broken light stand. So if the murder weapon was the light stand (shards), but April testifies it was The Thinker statue, then that's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 4 (April saying The Thinker was the weapon) contradicts Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Evidence 3 (Receipt for light stand), implying the light stand was the actual weapon. 

Alternatively, maybe the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says death was from a single blow, but if the Thinker's gears were removed, maybe the statue was hollow or lighter, making it less likely to cause such trauma. However, that's speculative. 

Another point: The Thinker is described as the murder weapon in Evidence 1. So if April's testimony says it's The Thinker, and Evidence 1 confirms it's the weapon, then there's no contradiction. But the contradiction might be elsewhere. Let me check other testimonies. 

Testimony 1 and 3 by April: She says the victim dodged the first attack, ran to the right, then was struck. The autopsy says death was instantaneous. If the victim was hit once and died instantly, then running after being hit contradicts that. Wait, the autopsy says "Death was instantaneous. Death caused by a single blow... May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Wait, that's conflicting within the evidence. But in the problem statement, maybe the contradiction is between the testimony and the autopsy. Testimony 1 says the victim dodged, ran, then was struck. Autopsy says death was instantaneous from a single blow, but also may have lived a few minutes. If the testimony describes the victim being hit after running, but the autopsy says the blow was immediately fatal, but then again, the description says "may have lived a few minutes," which is confusing. 

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says "she hit her with that weapon! I saw it!" referring to Maya. But Evidence 4 is Maya's memo about a cell phone conversation with her sister, which might have an alibi. But not sure. 

Wait, the Thinker's gears being removed. If the gears were removed, maybe the statue couldn't have been used as a clock, but that's not directly related to being a weapon. Unless the removal of gears made it lighter, but that's again speculative. 

Alternatively, looking at the Receipt (Evidence 3) which is for a glass light stand bought the day before. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken light stand. If the murder weapon was the light stand (thus the shards), but April testifies it was The Thinker statue, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 4 (April saying The Thinker was the weapon) contradicts Evidence 2 and 3 (which suggest the light stand was involved). But since we can only pick one pair, perhaps Evidence 3 (Receipt) and Testimony 4. But the user might expect Evidence 1 (The Thinker as murder weapon) vs Testimony from April, but no. Wait, the Thinker is listed as the murder weapon in Evidence 1. So if the testimony says it's the murder weapon, that's not a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 1 and the Autopsy Report. Testimony 1 says the victim dodged, ran, then was struck. Autopsy says death was instantaneous. If the victim was hit once and died instantly, they couldn't have run after being struck. But the autopsy also says "may have lived for a few minutes," which complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the initial attack was dodged, then the second attack killed her. But the autopsy says single blow. So if the testimony says the victim was hit after running, but the autopsy says death was from a single blow, then maybe the testimony is implying multiple blows, which contradicts the autopsy. But the testimony says "she hit her with that weapon! I saw it!" (Testimony 3), indicating a single strike. Hmm, this is getting complicated. 

Wait, Testimony 1: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right." Testimony 2: "Then the girl... ran after her." Testimony 3: "And she hit her with that weapon." So the sequence is: first attack (dodged), victim runs, chased, then struck once. Autopsy says single blow causing death. So that matches. So perhaps no contradiction there. 

Back to the glass shards and receipt. If the receipt shows the light stand was purchased, and the glass shards are from it, but the testimony says the weapon was The Thinker, then that's a contradiction. So Testimony 4 (April says Thinker is the weapon) vs Evidence 3 (Receipt for light stand) and Evidence 2 (glass shards). Since the question asks for one pair, perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 4 (April's identification of The Thinker) and Evidence 3 (Receipt for light stand bought day before, implying it was broken and used as weapon). But how does that directly contradict? The receipt's description says the back has letters in blood. Maybe the receipt's blood writing indicates something else. Alternatively, the fact that the light stand was purchased the day before and broken suggests it was at the scene, but the testimony says the murder weapon was The Thinker. Therefore, if the real weapon was the light stand, the testimony is wrong. But Evidence 1 states that The Thinker was the murder weapon. So there's inconsistency between the evidence and testimony? Wait, no. Evidence 1 says The Thinker was the murder weapon. So if April's testimony says the same, that's consistent. Then why the receipt and glass shards? Maybe those are red herrings. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. 

Wait, let's read the evidence again. Evidence 1: "The Thinker" is the murder weapon. A clock in the form of a statue, gears removed. So the prosecution's evidence is that this statue was the weapon. But the defense might argue that the glass light stand was the real weapon. Therefore, the contradiction could be between Testimony 4 (April says The Thinker) and Evidence 2/3 (glass shards and receipt), implying the real weapon was the light stand. However, the problem states that we must select one evidence and one testimony that contradict each other. So if the receipt (Evidence 3) shows purchase of the light stand, and the glass shards (Evidence 2) are from it, but the testimony says the weapon was The Thinker, then the testimony contradicts the evidence suggesting the light stand was the weapon. But since Evidence 1 explicitly states The Thinker is the murder weapon, perhaps there's a contradiction between Evidence 1 and Testimony 4. Wait, no. Testimony 4 agrees with Evidence 1. Unless... maybe the Thinker's gears being removed means it wasn't functional as a clock, but that doesn't affect it being a weapon. Alternatively, if the gears' removal made it too light to cause the fatal injury, but that's speculative. 

Alternatively, looking at the autopsy report (Evidence 5): "Death was instantaneous. May have lived a few minutes." That's a contradiction within the evidence itself, but the question is about evidence vs testimony. 

Alternatively, Testimony 1 by April: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right." If the floor plans (Evidence 8) show that there's no space to the right, but since I don't have details on the floor plans, this is hard to confirm. 

Another angle: The Thinker's description says it's a clock made by Larry Butz with gears removed. The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. If the murder happened on 9/5 (as per the autopsy), and the light stand was bought the day before (9/4), then it's in the vicinity. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are broken beyond recognition, but if they were part of the light stand, maybe the real weapon was a piece of glass, implying a sharp object, but the autopsy says blunt force trauma. So if the light stand's glass was used as a sharp object, but the autopsy says blunt, then the real weapon must be a blunt object like The Thinker. Therefore, Testimony 4 (April) correctly identifies The Thinker, and the glass shards are a red herring. 

This is tricky. Maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let's check other testimonies. Testimony 0: April says "I did see everything! I did!" But maybe the wiretap (Evidence 7) found in her hotel room suggests she was being monitored, implying she's lying. But that's more about credibility than direct contradiction. 

Alternatively, Bellboy's Affidavit (Evidence 12) describes the man with April at the hotel. If that man is someone else, but April's testimony doesn't mention him, that's a contradiction. But I don't have info on the affidavit's content. 

Wait, the Wiretap (Evidence 7) is in April's hotel room. If she was being monitored, maybe her testimony is coerced or she's lying. But how does that contradict evidence? 

Another thought: The Thinker's gears being removed. If the statue was supposed to be a clock but couldn't function, maybe the time of death is related. The autopsy says 9:00 PM. If the gears were removed, maybe the clock's time was stuck, but that's a stretch. 

Alternatively, the receipt (Evidence 3) has blood letters. If those letters incriminate someone else, contradicting April's testimony. But without knowing what the letters say, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, the Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) says death was at 9:00 PM. If April's testimony places events leading up to that time, but other evidence like the receipt's date is the day before, that's not a contradiction. 

Hmm. I'm circling here. Let's try to summarize. The most likely contradiction is between April's Testimony 4 (identifying The Thinker as the weapon) and the combination of Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Evidence 3 (Receipt for light stand), suggesting the light stand was the real weapon. However, since the problem asks for one evidence-testimony pair, the best fit might be Testimony 4 and Evidence 3. The receipt shows purchase of a glass light stand the day before, which could imply it was present and broken (Evidence 2), but April testifies the weapon was The Thinker. So the contradiction is between her testimony and the evidence suggesting the light stand was the weapon. However, Evidence 1 explicitly states The Thinker is the murder weapon, so that's conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the contradiction is within the evidence itself. But the question wants evidence vs testimony. 

Alternatively, the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says death was from a single blow, but if the glass shards indicate multiple strikes, but they're broken beyond recognition. Not sure. 

Wait, the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a light stand broken beyond recognition. If the murder weapon was the light stand, which shattered upon impact, that could produce a single blow with the stand breaking into shards. But the autopsy says single blow. So that's consistent. 

Another angle: The Thinker statue's gears being removed. If the gears were part of the clock mechanism, their removal would mean the statue is lighter, but still could be a weapon. However, if the gears were heavy metal parts, removing them makes the statue less likely to cause a fatal blow. If the autopsy says the blow required significant force, and the statue without gears couldn't provide that, then Testimony 4's claim that The Thinker was the weapon contradicts Evidence 1's implication that it's too light. But this is speculative. 

Alternatively, the Receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from that stand. If the murder weapon was the light stand, then April's Testimony 4 is false because she claims it was The Thinker. Thus, Testimony 4 contradicts Evidence 3. Because the receipt shows the light stand was available, and if it's broken, maybe it was used as the weapon, but April says it was the statue. Therefore, {"evidence": 3, "testimony": 4}?

But Evidence 1 states The Thinker is the murder weapon, so this would mean the evidence contradicts itself. But the user might expect the contradiction between Testimony 4 and Evidence 3. Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and the combination of Evidence 2 and 3. But since we can only choose one evidence, maybe Evidence 3 (Receipt) and Testimony 4. 

Alternatively, maybe the autopsy report's initial statement of instantaneous death contradicts Testimony 1 where the victim ran after being attacked. If the victim was struck and died instantly, they couldn't have run. But the autopsy also says "may have lived a few minutes," which allows for some movement. So that's not a direct contradiction. 

I think the best answer here is that Testimony 4 (April stating the weapon was The Thinker) contradicts Evidence 3 (Receipt for the light stand) because the receipt suggests the light stand was purchased and present, potentially used as the weapon, while the testimony points to The Thinker. But since Evidence 1 says The Thinker is the weapon, this might not be a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps another angle. 

Wait, Evidence 1: The Thinker's gears have been removed. If the gears were part of the weapon's structure, their removal might mean it couldn't have caused the blunt force trauma described. But this is speculative. However, the autopsy says the cause was a single blow by a blunt object. If The Thinker, even without gears, is a solid statue, it could still be a blunt object. So no contradiction there. 

Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (April saying she saw Maya hit Mia with the weapon) and Maya's Memo (Evidence 4) which has a recorded conversation with her sister. If the memo's conversation occurred after the time of death, that would provide an alibi. But without the conversation's timestamp, hard to confirm. 

Alternatively, the Wiretap (Evidence 7) in April's room suggests she was being monitored, which might imply her testimony is unreliable. But again, not a direct contradiction. 

Given all this, the most plausible contradiction is between Testimony 4 (April identifying The Thinker as the weapon) and Evidence 3 (Receipt for the light stand purchased the day before, implying it was present and possibly the real weapon). Therefore, the JSON answer should be {"evidence": 3, "testimony": 4}. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe Testimony 4 contradicts Evidence 1 if The Thinker couldn't be the weapon. But Evidence 1 says it's the weapon. Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is in Testimony 4 where April says the weapon was The Thinker, but the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says "may have lived a few minutes after being hit," implying the victim was alive after the strike, which conflicts with the Testimony's account of events. But that's not a direct contradiction. 

I think I need to settle on the initial thought: April's Testimony 4 says the weapon was The Thinker, but the receipt (Evidence 3) and glass shards suggest the light stand was the weapon. So the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 3.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 4 by April May states that the murder weapon was "The Thinker" statue. However, Evidence 3 is a receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder, and Evidence 2 describes glass shards from a broken light stand. This suggests the light stand was present and possibly used as the weapon, contradicting April's testimony identifying "The Thinker."
{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 4}

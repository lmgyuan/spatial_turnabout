Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The question gives a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. My job is to find one pair where the evidence and testimony don't match up.

First, I'll look through the testimonies. The testimonies here are all from Armstrong (Jean Armstrong), Testimonies 0 to 4. Let's go through each one.

Testimony 0: "La mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves." So he's talking about a mirror dividing the restaurant into two halves. Looking at the evidences, maybe the Tres Bien Floor Plans (Evidence 11) or the Crime Photo (12) could relate. The Floor Plans say the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. The Crime Photo shows two tables separated by a folding screen. Wait, but Armstrong mentions a mirror, while the photo mentions a folding screen. That might be a contradiction. Because if there's a mirror in the middle according to Testimony 0, but the Crime Photo shows a folding screen separating the tables, that's conflicting. So Evidence 12 (Crime Photo 1) and Testimony 0 could contradict.

Wait, Testimony 0 says the mirror was in the middle, but Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) describes the scene with a folding screen separating the tables. So if the mirror was there, the photo should show a mirror, not a folding screen. Therefore, Armstrong's testimony about the mirror contradicts the evidence of the Crime Photo which shows a folding screen. That's one possible contradiction.

Testimony 1: "Z'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim." If the mirror was placed in the middle, maybe that seat would be the one where the witness could see via the mirror. But the Floor Plans (Evidence 11) say the view from the entrance was obstructed and could only see the patio. Not sure if that directly contradicts, but maybe.

Testimony 2: "Z'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting." Not sure which evidence contradicts that yet.

Testimony 3: "After la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way." So he moved the mirror after the incident. The Crime Photo (12) was taken at the scene. If the photo shows a folding screen instead of a mirror, then Armstrong's claim that there was a mirror which he moved after would conflict with the photo taken at the time of the crime showing a folding screen. So Testimony 0 (mirror in the middle) vs Evidence 12 (folding screen in the crime photo). So that's the contradiction.

Therefore, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 0 from Armstrong. Because the testimony says there was a mirror dividing the restaurant, but the photo shows a folding screen separating the tables. So the mirror vs folding screen discrepancy.

Let's analyze the provided materials:
Testimony 0 by Armstrong claims there was a mirror dividing the restaurant. However, **Evidence 12 (Crime Photo)** describes the scene with two tables separated by a **folding screen**, not a mirror. This directly contradicts the testimony about the mirror's presence at the time of the crime.  
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 0}
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair, and the answer must end with a JSON object in the specified format.

First, I'll go through the list of testimonies and evidences to see where there might be inconsistencies.

Looking at the Testimonies:

Testimony 2 from Armstrong says, "I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM." So the old man arrived just after 2 PM. Now, checking the Evidence related to the time of death. 

Evidence 10 is Glen's Autopsy Report, which states the time of death was between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. Wait, but Testimony 2 says the old man arrived just after 2 PM. Let's see how that interacts with other testimonies. 

Testimony 5 says, "It was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred." If the old man arrived just after 2 PM, and 5 minutes later the poisoning happened, that would place the incident around 2:05 PM. But the autopsy report allows death up to 2:30 PM. However, maybe there's another contradiction here.

Wait, maybe I should check the timeline more carefully. The victim died of potassium cyanide poisoning (Evidence 10). The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has the poison, and the poisoning incident occurred 5 minutes after the victim found out he won the lottery (Testimony 4 and 5). 

But according to Testimony 2, the old man arrived just after 2 PM. Then, the poisoning was 5 minutes later, around 2:05 PM. However, the time of death is between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. Wait, but if the poisoning happened at 2:05 PM, the time of death would be within that window. That seems okay. So maybe not the contradiction here.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: "Z'ere were no other customers." But let's check the Crime Photo (Evidence 12). The photo shows two dining tables, one empty and the other where the victim collapsed. There's a vase on each table, and Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) says he broke the vase at his seat. Wait, if Victor was present, then Testimony 3's claim that there were no other customers contradicts Victor's presence. Because Victor Kudo (Character 7) was in Tres Bien at the time (according to his description). Also, Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony mentions breaking a vase, implying he was there. So Armstrong's Testimony 3 ("no other customers") contradicts Victor's presence as per his own testimony. But the user wants a contradiction between evidence and testimony. Wait, Victor's Testimony is Evidence 18. So Testimony 3 (Armstrong) says no other customers, but Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) implies he was there as a customer. So that's a contradiction between Testimony 3 and Evidence 18. However, the user asks for evidence and testimony, so that would be Evidence 18 and Testimony 3. But let me confirm.

Wait, Testimony 3 is by Armstrong stating there were no other customers. Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony where he says he broke a vase at his seat. That would mean Victor was a customer present, contradicting Armstrong's statement. So Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) contradicts Testimony 3 (Armstrong's claim of no other customers). That's one possible pair.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 2, which says the old man arrived just after 2 PM. The Millionaire Radio Flyer (Evidence 19) is an event that happens every Monday at 1:30 PM. The incident happened on Dec 3rd. Let me check what day Dec 3rd was in the year of the case. Wait, the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) is from Dec 3rd, the day of the incident. The Millionaire Radio Flyer event is at 1:30 PM every Monday. If Dec 3rd was a Monday, then the event would be at 1:30 PM. But if the victim died between 1:30 and 2:30 PM, maybe there's a connection. However, the exact day of the week isn't provided. Maybe not directly contradictory.

Another angle: The victim's Calendar (Evidence 20) mentions a meeting with "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre) on Dec 3rd. If the meeting was supposed to be around the time of death, but Testimony 2 says the old man arrived after 2 PM. Not sure.

Looking back at the contradiction between Testimony 3 (no other customers) and Evidence 18 (Victor's presence). Since Victor is a customer, that's a contradiction. So the testimony in question is Testimony 3, and the contradicting evidence is Evidence 18. But the user wants the answer in the format {"evidence": X, "testimony": Y}. So in this case, Evidence 18 contradicts Testimony 3. Therefore, the answer would be evidence 18 and testimony 3.

Wait, but the user might expect another contradiction. Let me check again.

Another possible point: Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup) has fingerprints of Maggey and the victim. Evidence 16 (Potassium Cyanide) is found in Maggey's apron with her fingerprints. But Testimony from Maggey? Wait, Maggey's testimonies aren't listed here. The testimonies given are all from Armstrong (Testimonies 0-6). So maybe the contradiction is between Armstrong's testimony and some evidence.

Wait, Testimony 2 by Armstrong says the old man arrived just after 2 PM. Then Testimony 5 says the poisoning happened 5 minutes later (2:05 PM). The autopsy report (Evidence 10) says time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. That fits. So no contradiction there.

But what about Testimony 6: "Non, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting." Maybe related to the Scooter (Evidence 7) which was ridden by the phony, but not sure.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket found in Maggey's possession. If the victim had a winning ticket, maybe that's a motive, but not directly contradicting a testimony.

Wait, the key contradiction is between Armstrong's Testimony 3 (no other customers) and Victor's presence as indicated by Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony). Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 18 and Testimony 3.

Let's analyze the testimonies and evidences step by step. Testimony 3 by Armstrong claims "Z'ere were no other customers" at Tres Bien during the incident. However, Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) states Victor broke a vase at his seat, implying he was present as a customer. This directly contradicts Armstrong's assertion of no other customers.  
{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. First, I need to go through all the testimonies and see if any of them conflict with the evidence provided.

Looking at the characters involved, the testimonies are mostly from Tigre (Testimonies 0 to 4). The other characters might have relevant info, but the focus is on contradictions between testimonies and evidence. 

Starting with Testimony 1: Tigre claims he was tied up with business in December last year and spent all his time in his office. Then Testimony 2 adds that on the day in question (Dec 3rd, since the incident happened then), he was in the office too and never saw the victim (Glen Elg). He also tells to check his alibi with Violetta (Testimony 4). 

Now looking at the evidence. Let's check Evidence 20: Glen's Calendar has a note on Dec 3rd to "Meet with The Tiger". The Tiger is Furio Tigre's nickname, as per his description (Character 10). So if Glen had a meeting scheduled with Tigre on that day, but Tigre claims he was in the office all day and didn't see Glen, that's a contradiction. 

Additionally, Evidence 25 is a repair bill paid by Tigre to the Cadaverini Family, which might connect him to other activities, but the main contradiction seems to be between Tigre's testimony (Testimony 2) saying he never saw Glen and the calendar note (Evidence 20) indicating a planned meeting. 

Also, Evidence 24 mentions Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender, linking Tigre's location to the crime scene, but that's more circumstantial. The key contradiction is the scheduled meeting versus Tigre's alibi.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 2 from Tigre states he was in his office on Dec. 3rd and "never saw that kid before" (referring to Glen Elg). However, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) explicitly notes a meeting scheduled with "The Tiger" (Tigre's nickname) on Dec. 3rd. This directly contradicts Tigre's claim of never interacting with Glen that day.
{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair, and I have to present it in JSON at the end.

First, let's list out the characters, evidences, and testimonies. But since the question is about contradiction between evidence and testimony, I'll focus on those.

Looking at the testimonies, especially those by Tigre (Character 10). Testimony 0 says Tigre claims he never met Glen Elg. Testimony 1 mentions a "lame guy with that name" (Glen) wanted to borrow cash. Testimony 2 says he set up a meeting at Tender Lender. Testimony 3 says Glen didn't show up. Testimony 4 says Tigre never went to Tres Bien.

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 20 is Glen's Calendar with a note on Dec 3rd (day of the incident) saying "Meet with The Tiger". The Tiger is Tigre's nickname, as per his description. So, the victim had a meeting scheduled with Tigre on the day he died. 

But according to Tigre's testimonies (Testimony 3), he claims that Glen didn't show up to the meeting at Tender Lender. However, Evidence 10 (Glen's Autopsy Report) states the time of death was between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. If the meeting was at Tender Lender, and Glen died at Tres Bien (the crime scene), how did he end up there? Wait, maybe the meeting was supposed to be at Tender Lender, but Glen went to Tres Bien instead?

Wait, Evidence 20's calendar note is "Meet with The Tiger", which is Tigre. But the meeting location isn't specified there. However, Tigre's Testimony 2 says the meeting was set up at his office, Tender Lender. Testimony 3 says Glen didn't show up. However, the crime happened at Tres Bien, where Glen was poisoned. So if Glen was at Tres Bien during the time of death (1:30-2:30 PM), he couldn't have been at Tender Lender. But if the meeting was supposed to be at Tender Lender, and Glen didn't go there (as per Tigre's testimony), then how does the autopsy report and the crime location fit?

Wait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let me check other evidences. Evidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket found on Maggey. Evidence 16: Potassium Cyanide in her apron with her prints. Testimony 4 from Tigre says he's never been to Tres Bien. But maybe there's a contradiction between Tigre's testimony and another evidence.

Wait, Evidence 20: Glen's Calendar has a note to meet The Tiger (Tigre) on Dec 3rd. If Tigre claims he never met Glen (Testimony 0), but the calendar suggests a meeting was planned. However, Tigre in Testimony 1 acknowledges that someone named Glen wanted to borrow money, so he's aware of him. The contradiction might be if there's evidence that they did meet. But Tigre says Glen didn't show up (Testimony 3). But perhaps the meeting actually happened elsewhere.

Wait, Evidence 25: Repair Bill paid by Tigre to Cadaverini. Not directly related. Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender. Maybe indicates a connection, but Tigre says he never went to Tres Bien (Testimony 4). If Tres Bien matches are at Tender Lender, perhaps someone from Tender Lender was there. Not sure. 

Evidence 26: Paper Badge at Tender Lender. Maybe used to impersonate, but not directly conflicting. Evidence 23: MC Bomber disc at Tender Lender. The Sports Paper (Evidence 3) has a doodle about MC Bomber. Maybe connects to Tigre's loan business. 

But the key contradiction seems to be between Tigre's Testimony 0 ("I never met Glen Elg") and Evidence 20 (Glen's calendar note to meet The Tiger). If the meeting was set up but Glen didn't come (Testimony 3), then they didn't meet. But maybe there's evidence that they did meet. Wait, the autopsy says Glen died at Tres Bien. So if the meeting was at Tender Lender, and he died elsewhere, maybe Tigre's testimony holds. Hmm. Then perhaps another angle.

Looking at Testimony 4: Tigre says he never went to Tres Bien. But Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender. Maybe Tigre has those matches, implying he was there, but he denies it. But the matches are "found lying in Tender Lender," so maybe they were brought there by someone else. Not sure if that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 8: Jean's Loan Contract with Tender Lender. Jean is the chef at Tres Bien. So Tender Lender (Tigre's company) has a loan with Jean. Maybe Tigre had a reason to be at Tres Bien, but he denies it in Testimony 4. If there's evidence placing him there, that would contradict. But I don't see evidence directly placing him at Tres Bien. 

Wait, Evidence 7: Scooter ridden by the phony (Maggey's scooter?), wheel guard smashed. Not sure. 

Another angle: Evidence 16 (Potassium Cyanide in Maggey's apron) and Testimony from Maggey (if any). But the testimonies given are only from Tigre here. The problem states the testimonies provided are Testimony 0 to 4, all by Tigre. So need to check contradictions between Tigre's testimonies and the evidences.

Wait, Testimony 0: "I never met Glen Elg." Testimony 1: "There was some lame guy with that name... wanted to borrow cash from me." So he acknowledges knowing about Glen but claims never to have met him. Evidence 20 says Glen had a meeting with The Tiger (Tigre) scheduled. If the meeting was set up but Glen didn't show (Testimony 3), then they didn't meet. But if there's evidence that they did meet, that would contradict. However, the autopsy says Glen died at Tres Bien. So unless Tigre was at Tres Bien, which he denies (Testimony 4), perhaps the meeting never happened. 

But wait, the meeting was supposed to be at Tender Lender (Testimony 2), and Glen died at Tres Bien. So maybe the contradiction is between Tigre's claim that he never met Glen (Testimony 0) and the possibility that the meeting did happen elsewhere. But without evidence of them meeting, perhaps not. 

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket found on Maggey. If the ticket is a winning one worth half a million, and Evidence 8: Jean's loan is half a million. Maybe Jean had motive, but not directly related to Tigre's testimony. 

Wait, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) and Testimony 0 (Tigre never met Glen). If the calendar note indicates a planned meeting, but Tigre says he never met him, that's a contradiction. Because if the meeting was set but not attended, Tigre's Testimony 0 is technically true (they didn't meet), but the calendar note implies intent. But maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and something else. 

Alternatively, Testimony 4: "I ain't never been to that Tres Bien joint." But Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender. If Tigre's office has matches from Tres Bien, maybe he or someone from his office was there, which might imply he was there. But he denies ever going. So the presence of Tres Bien matches at his office could suggest a connection, but it's circumstantial. However, the matches could have been brought by someone else, like Jean, who works at Tres Bien and has a loan with Tender Lender. So maybe not a direct contradiction. 

Another possibility: Evidence 25 (Repair Bill paid by Tigre to Cadaverini) and Testimony 4. If the repair bill is for a vehicle used to go to Tres Bien, but Tigre says he never went. But the bill just shows payment, not location. 

Wait, looking back at Testimony 2: Tigre set up the meeting at Tender Lender. Testimony 3: Glen didn't show. Evidence 20: Glen's calendar notes the meeting. So the meeting was scheduled, but according to Tigre, Glen didn't come. However, the victim died at Tres Bien during the time of the meeting. So if the meeting was at Tender Lender, but Glen was at Tres Bien, then Tigre's story holds. But maybe there's a contradiction in the timing. 

The autopsy (Evidence 10) says death between 1:30-2:30 PM. The meeting with Tigre (Testimony 2) was at Tender Lender, but the time isn't specified. However, Evidence 19: Millionaire Radio Flyer is an event every Monday at 1:30 PM. The incident was on Dec 3rd, which is a Monday. So the event was at 1:30 PM. The time of death overlaps with that. Maybe the victim was at the event, but the meeting was at Tender Lender. Not sure. 

Alternatively, if the meeting was scheduled for a time before the death, but the victim didn't show, then died at Tres Bien. That's possible. So no direct contradiction there. 

Wait, perhaps Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar note) and Tigre's Testimony 0. If the calendar note shows Glen intended to meet The Tiger, which is Tigre, but Tigre says he never met Glen. However, Testimony 1 and 2 show that Tigre acknowledges the loan request and setup meeting, but claims Glen didn't come. So Testimony 0's "never met" is true if the meeting didn't happen. But maybe there's evidence that they did meet. 

Wait, looking at Evidence 25: Repair Bill paid by Tigre to Cadaverini. If this repair is related to the scooter (Evidence 7) that the phony used, maybe Tigre was involved in the phony's activities. But not directly related to meeting Glen. 

Alternatively, Evidence 26: Paper Badge at Tender Lender. If someone impersonated a lawyer, maybe Tigre was involved in framing Maggey. But not directly conflicting with his testimonies. 

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the other evidences. Evidence 13: Coffee Cup with Maggey's prints. Evidence 16: Poison in her apron. But her prints are on both. That's incriminating for her, but not related to Tigre's testimonies. 

Wait, Evidence 20: Glen's Calendar says "Meet with The Tiger" on Dec 3rd. The Tiger is Tigre. Testimony 0: Tigre says he never met Glen. If the meeting happened, then Tigre is lying. But according to Testimony 2 and 3, the meeting was set up but Glen didn't show. So if the meeting didn't happen, then Tigre's Testimony 0 is truthful. But if there's evidence that the meeting did happen, that would contradict. However, the autopsy places Glen's death at Tres Bien, not at Tender Lender, so he couldn't have been at the meeting. Therefore, Tigre's Testimony 0 and 3 are consistent. 

Wait, but what if the meeting was actually at Tres Bien? Then Tigre's Testimony 4 (never been to Tres Bien) would conflict. But according to Testimony 2, the meeting was at Tender Lender. So no. 

Wait, maybe the key contradiction is between Testimony 4 (Tigre never went to Tres Bien) and Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender). The matches are from Tres Bien but found in Tigre's office. If Tigre had the matches, it suggests he was there, but he denies it. However, the matches could have been brought by someone else, like Jean, who works at Tres Bien and has a loan with Tender Lender. So it's possible that Jean brought them, so it's not a direct contradiction. 

Alternatively, Evidence 8: Jean's Loan Contract with Tender Lender. If Jean owed money to Tigre's company, maybe Tigre had reason to visit Tres Bien to pressure Jean. But again, no direct evidence of Tigre being there. 

Wait, another angle: Testimony 0 (Tigre never met Glen) and Evidence 14 (Lottery Ticket found on Maggey). If the lottery ticket is connected to Tigre, but I don't see the link. 

Alternatively, Evidence 21: Losing Horse Racing Tickets in Glen's desk. He might have been in debt, leading him to borrow from Tigre. Which aligns with Testimony 1. But no contradiction here. 

Wait, back to Testimony 4: Tigre never went to Tres Bien. But Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches at Tender Lender. If Tigre's office has matches from Tres Bien, that could imply that someone from Tender Lender was there. But Tigre denies ever going. However, maybe another employee went, so not necessarily a contradiction. 

Hmm. Maybe I need to look for a more direct contradiction. Let's see: Testimony 3: "I waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed." If there's evidence that Tigre was at Tres Bien during the time of the murder, that would contradict Testimony 4. But I don't see such evidence. 

Wait, Evidence 3: Sports Paper from Dec 3rd with doodle 'MC Bomber' linked to 100,000 crossed out. Evidence 23: MC Bomber disc at Tender Lender. So Tigre's company has the disc, which is a virus. The doodle might imply someone (Glen?) was involved with MC Bomber. If Glen had a meeting with Tigre about this, but the meeting didn't happen. Not sure. 

Alternatively, Evidence 20 (Glen's meeting with The Tiger) and Testimony 0 (never met). If the meeting was scheduled but not attended, then Testimony 0 is true. But if there's evidence that the meeting did occur, then contradiction. But I don't see such evidence. 

Wait, the victim died from potassium cyanide in the coffee at Tres Bien. The poison was in Maggey's apron. But how does that relate to Tigre? Maybe Tigre is the real killer, but that's not evidence. 

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 4 (never been to Tres Bien) and Evidence 24 (matches from Tres Bien at his office). But as I thought earlier, the matches could have come from someone else. 

Wait, another angle: Testimony 2 says Tigre set up the meeting at Tender Lender. Evidence 20 says Glen noted the meeting. But the victim died at Tres Bien, so he couldn't have gone to the meeting. Therefore, Tigre's Testimony 3 (Glen didn't show) is true. So no contradiction here. 

Maybe I'm missing something else. Let's check all evidences again. 

Evidence 17: Victim's Prescription Bag empty. The small bottle (Evidence 6) is the victim's ear medicine. Not sure. 

Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony about breaking a vase. Crime Photo shows vases intact. Wait, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows two intact vases on each table. But Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony) says he broke the vase at his seat. Contradiction here. But wait, Victor's Testimony is Evidence 18: "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." But in the Crime Photo (Evidence 12), both vases are intact. So that's a contradiction between Evidence 12 and Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony). However, the question asks for a testimony (from the Testimonies list) and evidence contradiction. The Testimonies provided in the question are Testimony 0-4 by Tigre. Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony, which is an evidence, not a testimony in the testimony list. So maybe the user wants a contradiction between the listed testimonies (0-4) and the evidences (0-27). 

So in this case, the contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 4 ("I ain't never been to that Tres Bien joint") and, say, Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender). But unless there's evidence that Tigre personally was there, it's not direct. Alternatively, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) and Tigre's Testimony 0 (never met). But the calendar note is about a meeting, not actual meeting. 

Wait, another angle: Testimony 1 by Tigre says "There was some lame guy with that name, though. Wanted to borrow cash from me." Evidence 20's calendar note shows Glen intended to meet The Tiger (Tigre) regarding borrowing cash. So that aligns. But Testimony 0 says "I never met Glen Elg." Which would be true if the meeting didn't happen. 

But wait, if the victim had a meeting scheduled with Tigre but didn't attend because he was killed, then there's no contradiction. So maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree. 

Another possibility: Testimony 4 (Tigre never went to Tres Bien) and Evidence 7 (Scooter ridden by the phony, wheel guard smashed). If the scooter is connected to Tigre, but I don't see the link. 

Wait, Evidence 26: Paper Badge at Tender Lender. If someone impersonated a lawyer using that badge, maybe Tigre was involved in framing someone. But not directly conflicting with his testimonies. 

Perhaps the key contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 4 (never went to Tres Bien) and Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender). If the matches are from Tres Bien and found in his office, it implies someone from Tender Lender was there. But Testimony 4 is about Tigre himself. Unless there's evidence he was there, it's not a direct contradiction. 

Wait, but the matches are advertising matches from Tres Bien. So maybe Tres Bien gives them to customers. If Tigre's office has them, maybe he or his associates were there. But he denies ever going. However, it's possible that another person, like Jean (who works there and has a loan with Tender Lender), brought the matches. So it's not a direct contradiction. 

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing the correct pair. Let's think again. The user wants one pair where evidence and testimony contradict. 

Looking back, the most direct contradiction I can see is between Testimony 4 (Tigre never went to Tres Bien) and Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender). If Tigre had the matches, it suggests he was there. But he denies it. So that's a possible contradiction. 

Alternatively, Evidence 25: Repair Bill paid by Tigre to Cadaverini. If the repair was for a vehicle used to go to Tres Bien, but Tigre denies being there. But the bill doesn't specify the reason for repair. 

Alternatively, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) and Testimony 0 (never met). But the calendar only notes a planned meeting, not actual meeting. 

Wait, another angle: Testimony 2 says the meeting was set up at Tender Lender. Evidence 20 says Glen noted the meeting. But the victim died at Tres Bien, so he didn't attend. No contradiction here. 

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (never been to Tres Bien) and Evidence 8 (Jean's Loan Contract with Tender Lender). Jean works at Tres Bien, so if Tigre is the loan owner, he might have visited to collect, but he denies it. But owning a loan doesn't require personal visits. 

Alternatively, Evidence 14: Lottery Ticket found on Maggey. If the ticket is connected to Tigre's loan business (half a million), but no direct link. 

At this point, the most plausible contradiction seems to be between Tigre's Testimony 4 (never been to Tres Bien) and Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender). The presence of the matches implies a connection, but Tigre denies ever going there. However, this might be circumstantial. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a better contradiction. Let's check the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has Maggey's prints, but she's the suspect. Not related to Tigre's testimonies. 

Wait, Evidence 16: Potassium Cyanide in Maggey's apron. She's the one accused. But again, not related to Tigre's testimonies. 

Another thought: Evidence 3 (Sports Paper with MC Bomber note) and Testimony 2 (Tigre set up a meeting). If MC Bomber is a virus (Evidence 23), and the sports paper links it to Glen, maybe there's a connection. But not directly a contradiction. 

Wait, Evidence 20: Glen's calendar has "Meet with The Tiger" on Dec 3rd. Testimony 2: Tigre set up the meeting at Tender Lender. Testimony 3: Glen didn't show. Evidence 10: Time of death 1:30-2:30 PM. If the meeting was scheduled for after 2:30 PM, then Glen could have attended. But he died before. But we don't know the meeting time. 

Alternatively, the Millionaire Radio Flyer (Evidence 19) is at 1:30 PM. If the meeting was at that time, but Glen was at the radio event, conflicting. But this is speculative. 

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to find the most straightforward contradiction. 

The key contradiction is between Testimony 4 (Tigre never went to Tres Bien) and Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender). The matches from Tres Bien in his office suggest a connection, but he denies ever being there. However, someone else could have brought them. 

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (Tigre never met Glen) and Evidence 20 (Glen's calendar note of meeting The Tiger). But Testimony 1 and 2 show that Tigre knew of Glen and set up a meeting, which aligns with the calendar note. Testimony 0's "never met" refers to not having met in person, which is true if the meeting didn't happen. So no contradiction. 

Wait, but if the calendar note shows that Glen intended to meet Tigre, and Tigre acknowledges setting up the meeting (Testimony 2), but claims Glen didn't come (Testimony 3), then there's no contradiction. 

Hmm. Maybe there's another angle. Let's look at Evidence 14: Lottery Ticket found on Maggey. If the ticket is a winning one for half a million, and Jean's loan (Evidence 8) is also half a million. Maybe Jean had a motive to steal the ticket, but how does that relate to Tigre's testimony? 

Alternatively, Evidence 20 (Glen's meeting with The Tiger) and Testimony 4 (Tigre never went to Tres Bien). If the meeting was supposed to be at Tender Lender, and the death happened at Tres Bien, then no contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let's consider Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony) where he says he broke a vase, but the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows intact vases. However, Testimony 18 is part of the evidences, not the testimonies provided in the question. The question's testimonies are only 0-4 by Tigre. So the user is asking about contradictions between the listed testimonies (0-4) and the evidences. 

Therefore, the only possible contradiction is between Tigre's testimonies and the evidences. 

After reviewing all possibilities, the most solid contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 4 ("I ain't never been to that Tres Bien joint") and Evidence 24 ("Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender"). The matches are from Tres Bien and found in Tigre's office. If he never went there, how did the matches get there? Unless someone else brought them, but it's a possible contradiction. 

Alternatively, perhaps Evidence 20 (Glen's calendar note) and Testimony 0 (Tigre never met Glen) is the contradiction. If the calendar shows a meeting was planned, but Tigre claims never to have met him. But Testimony 1 and 2 show that Tigre was aware of Glen and set up a meeting, so Testimony 0's "never met" could be a lie if they did meet. However, according to Testimony 3, Glen didn't show up, so they didn't meet. 

Given all that, the best contradiction is between Testimony 4 (Tigre never went to Tres Bien) and Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches at Tender Lender), implying he was there. But it's circumstantial. 

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (never met Glen) and Evidence 20 (calendar note), but Testimony 0 is technically true if they didn't meet. 

Wait, another angle: Evidence 20 says Glen was to meet "The Tiger" on Dec 3rd. Testimony 1 and 2 confirm that Tigre (The Tiger) had a meeting set up with Glen. So the calendar note aligns with Tigre's testimonies. Thus, no contradiction. 

I think the correct answer is Testimony 4 by Tigre (never been to Tres Bien) contradicted by Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender). The JSON would be {"evidence": 24, "testimony": 4}.

{"evidence": 24, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and wants to know which evidence and testimony contradict each other. They want just one pair, with an explanation, and the answer in JSON format as the last line.

First, I need to go through each testimony and see if any of them conflict with the evidence listed. Let's start by listing out all the testimonies and then check each against the evidence.

The testimonies are all from Tigre (Testimony 0 to 4):

Testimony 0: "I was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon." This refers to a meeting, maybe related to Glen Elg since he's the victim. Glen's Calendar (Evidence 20) notes a meeting with "The Tiger" on Dec 3rd. Since Tigre's nickname is "The Tiger," this aligns. So no contradiction here.

Testimony 1: "When I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene." He's saying he entered and saw the crime scene. Let's see if any evidence contradicts his presence. The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the scene with certain details. Maybe the layout? The Tres Bien Floor Plans (Evidence 11) mention the entrance's view is obstructed, only seeing the patio. If Tigre opened the door, could he see the victim's table? The Crime Photo shows that the tables are separated by a folding screen, and the view from the entrance is obstructed. So if he opened the door, he might not have actually seen the victim's table directly. But this could be a point of contradiction if the evidence says something about visibility. However, Tigre's testimony is about seeing the scene, which the photo might not directly contradict unless there's more info. Not sure yet.

Testimony 2: "The guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete." This describes the victim's position. The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) mentions the victim collapsed on the table. So that's consistent. No issue here.

Testimony 3: "I figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split." He left because he thought the police would come. Then Testimony 4: "I heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office." So he left before the police arrived, but heard sirens as he was leaving. Let's check evidence related to time. The victim's time of death is between 1:30 and 2:30 PM (Evidence 10). The Millionaire Radio Flyer (Evidence 19) mentions an event every Monday at 1:30 PM. The incident happened on Dec 3rd, which is the same day as the note in Glen's Calendar. If the meeting was at 1:30 PM, and the time of death is around then, then Tigre's exit might coincide with the arrival of the police. However, the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) is dated Dec 3rd and was left by a customer. The Repair Bill (Evidence 25) is paid by Tigre to the Cadaverini Family. But where's the contradiction?

Looking for a contradiction between a testimony and evidence. Let's think: Evidence 25 is the Repair Bill for $15,000 paid by Tigre. If Tigre's testimony says he went straight back to his office (Testimony 4), but maybe there's evidence he was elsewhere. Alternatively, Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender) might link Tigre to the location. But not sure.

Wait, another angle: Evidence 26 is the Paper Badge found at Tender Lender, made to look authentic. If Tigre was impersonating someone, maybe related to his testimony. But how?

Alternatively, the victim's Prescription Bag (Evidence 17) is empty. The Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is found in the kitchen, which was the victim's ear medicine. If the prescription was empty, maybe someone took the medicine. But how does that relate to Tigre's testimony?

Wait, let's look at Evidence 3: Sports Paper from Dec 3rd with a doodle 'MC Bomber' pointing to '100,000' crossed out, and 'Ahahahaha'. Evidence 23 is the MC Bomber disc found at Tender Lender (Tigre's place). The disc contains a virus. If Tigre was involved with that, but his testimonies don't mention it. But that's not a direct contradiction.

Another angle: The Potassium Cyanide (Evidence 16) is in Maggey's apron with her prints. The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has her and the victim's prints. If Maggey is the accused, but Tigre's testimony says he saw the scene and left. However, the contradiction might be elsewhere.

Wait, Testimony 4: Tigre says he heard sirens on his way out and went straight to his office. But Evidence 25 is the Repair Bill paid by Tigre to the Cadaverini Family. If the repair was for $15,000, maybe that's related to his scooter (Evidence 7, which is ridden by the phony and has a smashed wheel guard). If Tigre had to pay for repairs, but his testimony says he went straight back, maybe there's a timing issue. However, the Repair Bill's date isn't specified. Not sure.

Alternatively, Evidence 20: Glen's Calendar notes meeting with The Tiger (Tigre) on Dec 3rd. Testimony 0 says Tigre was supposed to meet "the kid" (maybe Glen) that afternoon. But the autopsy (Evidence 10) says time of death between 1:30-2:30 PM. If the meeting was scheduled, and Tigre arrived, but then the murder happened, perhaps there's a contradiction in the timeline. However, Tigre's testimony doesn't mention the meeting's time, just that he was supposed to meet. So unless there's evidence that the meeting was at a specific time conflicting with his testimony.

Alternatively, the Millionaire Radio Flyer (Evidence 19) is an event at 1:30 PM on Mondays. Dec 3rd is the day of the incident. If the event started at 1:30 PM, and the murder happened around then, maybe Tigre's presence overlaps. But not sure.

Wait, the key contradiction could be between Tigre's Testimony 3 and 4 where he says he left the scene and heard sirens on his way out. However, the victim's time of death is up to 2:30 PM. If the police arrived after the death, perhaps the timing here. But how does that contradict?

Wait, the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is the victim's ear medicine found in the kitchen with unidentified fingerprints. If Tigre's fingerprints are on it, but he claims he never touched it, that would be a contradiction. However, the evidence states the fingerprints are unidentified, so we don't know. Maybe not.

Looking again at the evidence related to Tigre. The Paper Badge (Evidence 26) found at Tender Lender (his place) is a fake. Maybe he impersonated someone. But how does that contradict his testimonies?

Alternatively, Evidence 25: Repair Bill paid by Tigre to Cadaverini. If he had dealings with them, but his testimony doesn't mention that. But that's not a direct contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 0: Tigre says he was supposed to meet "the kid" at the restaurant. The victim, Glen Elg, is a programmer, and his calendar mentions meeting "The Tiger." So that aligns. No contradiction here.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the testimonies again. Testimony 1: "When I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene." The Tres Bien Floor Plans (Evidence 11) state that the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows that the tables are separated by a folding screen. So if Tigre opened the door, according to the floor plans, he couldn't have seen the victim's table where the body was because the view is obstructed. Therefore, his Testimony 1 claims he saw the scene upon opening the door, but the floor plans suggest he couldn't have seen it from the entrance. That would be a contradiction between Testimony 1 and Evidence 11.

Yes, that makes sense. The floor plans (Evidence 11) state that the entrance view is obstructed, only the patio is visible. But Tigre's Testimony 1 says when he opened the door, he saw the scene (the victim's body), which according to the floor plans, he shouldn't have been able to see. Therefore, Testimony 1 contradicts Evidence 11.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 1 from Tigre states that upon opening the door, he saw the crime scene ("one ugly scene"). However, Evidence 11 (Tres Bien Floor Plans) indicates the view from the entrance is obstructed, only allowing sight of the patio. The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) further shows the victim's table was behind a folding screen, not visible from the entrance. Therefore, Tigre couldn't have seen the victim's table immediately upon entering, contradicting his testimony.
{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 1}
Alright, let's tackle this. So, the user has provided a bunch of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. They want just one pair in JSON format at the end.

First, I'll start by going through each testimony and cross-referencing them with the evidence. Let's look at the testimonies first. The testimonies here are all from Tigre (Testimony 0 to 7). Let's see what he's claiming.

Testimony 0: Tigre loaned Elg $100,000. Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) mentions a note about meeting "The Tiger" on the day of the incident. Since Tigre is known as "The Tiger," that aligns. So that's consistent.

Testimony 1: They were supposed to have a chat because Elg hit his payback date. That's again related to the loan, which connects to Evidence 8 (Jean's Loan Contract), but that's Jean's, not Elg's. Wait, Evidence 0's Autopsy Report says Glen died of potassium cyanide, time between 1:30-2:30 PM. But Tigre's testimonies are about the loan. Let me check the other evidences.

Testimony 4: Tigre says Elg won half a million. Evidence 14 is the Victim's Lottery Ticket for half a million, found on Maggey. So that matches, but how does that contradict? Well, maybe if Tigre's saying he didn't have another reason to kill, but the evidence shows something else.

Testimony 7: Tigre claims he was only after the $100k and had no other reason to kill. Now, looking at Evidence 25: Repair Bill paid by Tigre to Cadaverini for $15k. If Tigre owed money to the Cadaverini Family, maybe he had a motive beyond just the $100k loan. But how does that directly contradict his testimony?

Wait, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) has a note to meet "The Tiger" (Tigre) on the day of the incident. Testimony 1 says they were due to chat because of the payback date. That seems consistent. But Evidence 14 shows the lottery ticket was found on Maggey, which might imply Tigre didn't get the money, but Tigre says in Testimony 4 that Elg won, so maybe he wanted the lottery ticket. But Testimony 6 says "Thanks to what she [Maggey] did, my business with that kid was over!" So maybe because Maggey took the ticket, Tigre couldn't collect, hence a motive. But that's not a direct contradiction with evidence.

Wait, let's look at Evidence 16: Potassium Cyanide with Maggey's fingerprints in her apron. But the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has the victim and Maggey's prints. If Maggey is the one who poisoned the coffee, but Tigre's Testimony 5 says "If that waitress hadn't done what she done, everything woulda been over." So he's implying Maggey did something (maybe killing Elg) which ended his business with Elg. But if the poison was in the coffee cup with her prints, that suggests she did it, but Evidence 16 shows the poison was in her apron. However, that's not a contradiction with Tigre's testimony, because he's saying she did something, which aligns with her being the suspect.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 7 says Tigre had no other reason to kill except the $100k. But Evidence 20 shows Glen had a meeting with "The Tiger" (Tigre) on the day. If Tigre was there to collect the debt, but then Elg had the lottery ticket, maybe Tigre killed him to take the ticket. However, the lottery ticket was found on Maggey. So perhaps Tigre didn't get the ticket, hence his motive was the $100k. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's check Evidence 23: MC Bomber, a virus disc found at Tender Lender (Tigre's place). The Sports Paper (Evidence 3) has a doodle about 'MC Bomber' pointing to 100k crossed out. Testimony 0 says Tigre loaned Elg 100k. Maybe the MC Bomber was part of a plan to sabotage Elg's computer, but how does that connect to the murder?

Wait, Evidence 3: The sports paper from Dec 3rd (day of incident) has a doodle saying 'MC Bomber' with arrow to '100,000' crossed out, and 'Ahahaha'. This might relate to the loan (100k) being written off because Elg couldn't pay, but then he won the lottery. So Tigre's Testimony 2 says Elg couldn't pay, then Testimony 4 says Elg won. If Tigre knew about the lottery ticket, he might have killed Elg to take it. But the ticket was found on Maggey. So maybe Tigre didn't get it, hence he had no reason to kill, but the evidence might show he had another motive.

Wait, Evidence 25: Repair Bill for $15k paid to Cadaverini. If Tigre owed money to the mafia, he might have needed more cash, giving him another motive beyond the $100k. So Testimony 7 claims he only wanted the $100k, but Evidence 25 suggests he had other financial pressures, contradicting his statement. But is that a direct contradiction?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 4 where Tigre says Elg won half a million, but Evidence 14 says the ticket was found on Maggey. So maybe Tigre didn't get the ticket, which would mean he still had a reason to kill Elg for the original debt, but according to Testimony 6, Maggey's action ended his business. Hmm.

Wait, Testimony 5 and 6: Tigre says that because of what Maggey did (maybe killing Elg), his business with Elg was over. If Maggey killed Elg, then Tigre couldn't collect the debt, which is why he's angry. But if the poison was in Maggey's apron (Evidence 16), that supports her guilt. However, the contradiction here is between Tigre's testimony and evidence? Not sure.

Wait, let's check Testimony 7 again: "I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!" But Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) shows a meeting with "The Tiger" (Tigre) on the day. If Tigre met him, maybe he had another reason. But maybe the meeting was about the loan. Not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 4: Tigre says Elg won the lottery, which is supported by Evidence 14. But Evidence 14 says the ticket was found on Maggey. If Elg had the ticket, how did Maggey get it? Maybe she took it after he died. But Tigre's testimony 4 says Elg won, which is true, so no contradiction there.

Another angle: Evidence 16 (Potassium Cyanide in Maggey's apron) suggests she had the poison. Testimony 7 says Tigre had no reason to kill, but if the poison was in Maggey's possession, maybe he's lying. But that's not directly a contradiction between evidence and testimony. The testimony is Tigre's claim about his own motive, while the evidence implicates Maggey.

Wait, the question is which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So maybe Tigre's testimony that he only wanted the $100k and had no other reason is contradicted by evidence showing he had another motive. Let me check Evidence 25 again: Repair Bill paid by Tigre to Cadaverini for $15k. If he owed money to the mafia, he needed funds, giving him a motive to take Elg's lottery ticket. So even though he claims he only wanted the $100k, the repair bill suggests he had a larger financial burden, hence another motive. But is that a direct contradiction? Maybe not explicit.

Alternatively, Testimony 7: "I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!" But Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) shows a meeting with "The Tiger" on the day, which could imply that there was another reason for the meeting. But maybe that meeting was about the loan. Not sure.

Wait, Evidence 3: Sports Paper with 'MC Bomber' and 100k crossed out. If MC Bomber is a virus (Evidence 23), maybe Tigre was involved in some scheme related to that. But how does that tie to the murder? If Tigre was using the virus to sabotage something, perhaps related to the loan, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, Evidence 8: Jean's Loan Contract for half a million with Tender Lender. Tigre runs Tender Lender. If Jean owed half a million, maybe Tigre had other big debts to collect, but that's Jean's, not Elg's. So not directly related.

Wait, Evidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket found on Maggey. If Tigre wanted the $100k, but Elg had a winning ticket for $500k, Tigre might have wanted that instead. So Testimony 7 says he only wanted the $100k, but the existence of the lottery ticket gives a bigger motive. So that's a contradiction. Because Tigre claims he had no other reason, but the lottery ticket is a bigger reason. However, the ticket was found on Maggey, so maybe Tigre didn't know about it. But Testimony 4 says Tigre knew Elg won, so he did know. Therefore, he had a motive for the $500k, which contradicts his Testimony 7 that he only wanted the $100k.

Yes, that seems like a contradiction. Tigre's Testimony 7 says he had no other reason except the $100k, but Evidence 14 (the lottery ticket) gives him a much larger motive ($500k). So that's a direct contradiction. Therefore, the evidence 14 contradicts testimony 7.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 7}

Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through the testimonies and evidences one by one.

Looking at the testimonies first. All of them are from Trilo Quist, who is Ben's puppet. Testimonies 0 to 5 all revolve around Trilo planning to propose to Regina with a ring. He mentions having an engagement ring in his pocket, intending to give it to her that night, but ultimately not being able to, so he still has it in his pocket.

Now, checking the evidences. Let's see if any evidence contradicts this. Evidence 10 is a Ring with "From T to R" engraved. The description says it's a cheap ring with an eerie sparkle and the engraving. Since Trilo's real name is Benjamin Woodman, but Trilo is the puppet. However, the ring's engraving "From T to R" could stand for Trilo to Regina. But according to Trilo's testimonies, he still has the ring in his pocket because he couldn't give it to her. However, Evidence 10 is a ring found as evidence. If the ring is in the evidence list, that means it was found somewhere, not in Trilo's pocket. That would contradict Testimony 5 where Trilo says he still has it in his pocket. So if the ring is evidence 10, then Trilo's claim that he still has it is contradicted by the evidence showing the ring was found elsewhere. Therefore, Evidence 10 and Testimony 5 contradict each other.

Let's think step by step:
Trilo's Testimony 5 claims he still has the engagement ring in his pocket because he couldn't give it to Regina. However, Evidence 10 is a ring engraved "From T to R" found as evidence, implying it was recovered from the crime scene or elsewhere, not in Trilo's possession. This directly contradicts the testimony stating he still had it.
{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's try to figure out which testimony contradicts which evidence here. So the task is to look through the testimonies and evidences provided and find a pair where one directly contradicts the other.

First, let's list out the testimonies. The first four testimonies are all from Moe. He's talking about seeing a shadow that he thinks belongs to Max. He mentions seeing Max's symbols like the silk hat and cloak. In Testimony 0, Moe says the shadow could only have belonged to Max. Testimony 1 adds that he saw Max's symbols, and Testimony 2 specifies the silk hat and cloak. Testimony 3 mentions the silhouette, and Testimony 4 talks about the cloak fluttering so he couldn't see what was being carried.

Now looking at the evidences. Let's go through them one by one. Evidence 3 is the Silk Hat found at the crime scene. Evidence 4 is a promo poster of Max with his symbols: silk hat, cloak, white roses. Evidence 16 is a note that was torn, found in the Ringmaster's pocket, which is a message to the murderer referencing an event six months ago. Evidence 15 is the Max G. Bust, a bronze statue taken from the cafeteria before the crime. Evidence 19 is Bat's scarf with blood and pepper. 

Wait, Moe's testimonies all point to him seeing Max at the scene because of the symbols. But let's check if any evidence contradicts that. The Silk Hat (Evidence 3) is found at the crime scene, which supports Moe's testimony. But what about other evidences that might show Max couldn't have been there?

Looking at Evidence 5: Ringmaster's Papers showing Max got a huge raise a week ago. Maybe a motive? Not directly a contradiction. Evidence 14 is a photo of Max at an award ceremony with a bust next to him. Evidence 15 is the bust itself, which was taken from the cafeteria before the crime. If the bust was used as a weapon, maybe. The autopsy report (11) says the cause was blunt force trauma, which the bust could cause. But how does that relate to Moe's testimony?

Wait, if the murder weapon was the bust (Evidence 15), which is heavy, and Max's promo materials (Evidence 4) include the cloak and hat, but the bust being the actual weapon. However, Moe claims he saw Max's symbols (hat and cloak), so if Max was there, maybe he used the bust. But the contradiction would be if there's evidence that Max couldn't have been there. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the hat at the crime scene (Evidence 3) is supposed to be part of Max's outfit, but if the bust was moved from the cafeteria, perhaps there's a timing issue.

Alternatively, consider Testimony 0-4 where Moe says he saw Max's shadow with the hat and cloak, but if the Silk Hat (Evidence 3) was found at the crime scene, then Max would have left it there. But maybe the real killer took Max's hat to frame him. That's possible, but not a direct contradiction. Wait, but let's think again.

The main contradiction would be if a testimony says something that an evidence proves false. For example, if a testimony claims someone was seen wearing a specific item, but the evidence shows that item was elsewhere or not present. Let's look at Evidence 3: the silk hat is found at the crime scene. But according to Moe's testimonies, he saw Max wearing the silk hat and cloak. If Max was wearing the hat during the crime, how did it end up at the scene? That's possible, maybe he left it there. But perhaps another angle.

Wait, in Testimony 2, Moe says, "His silk hat. That black cloak. They were all there!" implying Max was wearing them. But if the silk hat was found at the crime scene (Evidence 3), that could mean Max left it there, which might not be a contradiction. Unless there's evidence that the hat couldn't have been there if Max was wearing it. Alternatively, maybe the promo poster (Evidence 4) shows Max's symbols, but if the bust (Evidence 15) was used as the murder weapon, and Max's alibi is elsewhere. Wait, perhaps the bust being moved from the cafeteria before the crime (as per Evidence 15's description) but how does that relate to Moe's testimony?

Alternatively, let's look at the note (Evidence 16). The note is addressed to the murderer, and mentions the incident six months ago (possibly related to Bat being bitten by Léon). The note was torn and found in the Ringmaster's pocket. If the Ringmaster (victim) had this note, maybe he was lured to the meeting place. But how does this contradict any testimony?

Alternatively, the scarf (Evidence 19) has pepper on it. The seasoning bottle (Evidence 13) has pepper. If the pepper was used in some way, maybe the scarf connects to someone else. But how does that contradict Moe's testimony?

Wait, Moe's testimonies are all about identifying Max based on his clothing. But if Max's hat was found at the crime scene (Evidence 3), that supports Moe's testimony. However, if there's evidence that Max wasn't there, like an alibi. Wait, the evidence list doesn't mention Max's alibi. Let's check Evidence 5: Max's salary papers, but that's not an alibi. Evidence 14: the photo of Max at the award ceremony. If the timing of the photo is relevant. Wait, the autopsy says time of death is 10:15 PM. If Max was at the ceremony at that time, but the photo (Evidence 14) doesn't specify the time. The photo is just a promo, maybe not taken on the day of the murder.

Alternatively, the bust (Evidence 15) was taken from the cafeteria before the crime. If the bust was used to kill the victim, and the bust is heavy, maybe the killer needed to move it. But if Moe saw Max, who would have needed to move the bust, but perhaps Max couldn't have done it alone. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is in the fact that Moe saw Max's symbols (hat and cloak), but the actual murder weapon was the bust, which is a heavy statue. If Max was there with his symbols, but the murder required moving the bust, which might be inconsistent. But that's more of a circumstantial inconsistency, not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows the victim's footprints leading to where he was found. If Moe's testimony says he saw Max at the scene, but the footprints are the victim's, that might not directly contradict unless there's evidence Max was elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the key contradiction is between Moe's testimonies that he saw Max (with the hat and cloak) and the fact that the Silk Hat (Evidence 3) was found at the crime scene. If Max was wearing the hat, how did it end up there? Unless he left it, which is possible. But that's not a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the promo poster (Evidence 4) shows that Max's symbols include a cloak, but if the crime happened in a certain way that the cloak couldn't be there. Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the bust (Evidence 15) being the murder weapon. If the bust is a statue of Max, then maybe the killer used it to hit the victim. But Moe saw Max, implying he was present. If the bust was used, maybe the real killer used the bust (which is heavy) to commit the murder, which would require strength. But Max being a magician, perhaps he's not strong enough? Not sure. That's speculative.

Wait, another angle: The note (Evidence 16) was torn by the Ringmaster and found in his pocket. The note was addressed to the murderer, meeting at 10 PM. The time of death is 10:15 PM. So the Ringmaster went to meet the murderer at 10 PM. If the meeting was at the lodging house plaza (per Evidence 16's description), but the crime scene is somewhere else? Wait, the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows the victim lying on a case in the snow with his footprints. The Circus Map (Evidence 6) mentions the lodging house is on the right, with Moe on first floor and Acro on third. If the meeting was at the lodging house plaza, but the victim was found elsewhere, maybe the crime scene is different. But how does that relate to Moe's testimony?

Alternatively, the victim's footprints leading to the spot where he was found (Crime Photo 2) suggests he walked there himself. If he was killed there by someone else, but Moe claims to have seen Max's shadow there. However, if the murder weapon was the bust from the cafeteria, which was moved, then maybe Max wasn't there. But this is still not a direct contradiction.

Wait, let's think again. The key contradiction has to be between a testimony and an evidence. For example, a testimony says "X was there" but evidence proves X couldn't be. Alternatively, a testimony claims not to have touched the murder weapon, but evidence shows their prints on it (like in the previous example). 

Looking at the testimonies again, all from Moe: he's saying he saw Max's shadow, hat, cloak, etc. So the testimonies are all about identifying Max as the perpetrator. The evidences that could contradict this would be something that shows Max wasn't there or couldn't have done it.

Looking at Evidence 3: the Silk Hat found at the crime scene. If Max's hat is there, that supports Moe's testimony. But maybe there's another evidence that shows Max wasn't present. For example, if there's an alibi. Let's check the evidences again. Evidence 14 is a Grand Prix Photo of Max at an award ceremony. If the photo was taken at the time of the murder, that would be a contradiction. But the photo's description doesn't mention the time. It just says it's a photo from the award ceremony. So unless we know the timing, we can't use that. 

Alternatively, Evidence 5: Max got a raise a week ago. Not relevant. Evidence 15: the bust was taken from the cafeteria before the crime. If the bust was used as the weapon, maybe the real killer took it, implying Max didn't need to be there. But Moe's testimony says he saw Max, which could mean the killer was disguised as Max. So if the killer used Max's hat and cloak to frame him, then the presence of the hat (Evidence 3) supports that. But the contradiction would be if there's evidence that Max's hat wasn't at the scene when Moe claims to have seen it. Wait, no, the hat is at the scene. So that supports Moe's testimony.

Hmm, maybe the contradiction is between Moe's Testimony 0-4 (saw Max's symbols) and Evidence 3 (Silk Hat found at the scene). Wait, if Max was wearing the hat during the crime, how was it found at the scene? Unless he left it there. That's possible. So no contradiction there.

Wait another angle: the victim's time of death is 10:15 PM (Evidence 11). The note (Evidence 16) says the meeting was at 10:00 PM. So the Ringmaster went to meet the murderer at 10, and was killed 15 minutes later. If Moe saw Max's shadow around that time, but Max had an alibi. However, there's no evidence of Max's whereabouts. 

Alternatively, the murder weapon is the bust (Evidence 15), which is heavy. If Max is a magician known for illusions and not strength, but that's speculative. 

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is in the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) showing the victim's footprints leading to the spot, implying he walked there alone. But Moe's testimony says he saw Max's shadow there. If Max was there, maybe there should be other footprints. But the evidence only mentions the victim's footprints. That could be a contradiction. If the Crime Photo shows only the victim's footprints, then Moe's claim that someone else (Max) was there would be contradicted because there are no other footprints. However, the photo's description says "the victim’s footprints leading to where he is are visible." It doesn't say there are no other footprints, just that the victim's are there. So maybe not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 17: Stage Costume not Maya's size. Not relevant. Evidence 19: Scarf with pepper and blood. If the pepper connects to the seasoning bottle (Evidence 13), maybe someone else involved. But how does that contradict Moe's testimony?

Wait, going back to the bust (Evidence 15). It was taken from the cafeteria before the crime. If the bust was used as the murder weapon, then the killer had to move it from the cafeteria to the crime scene. If Moe saw Max at the crime scene, but moving the bust would require someone strong, maybe Max couldn't do it. But that's an assumption.

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 4 where Moe says, "His cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying." If the murder weapon was the bust (heavy), but the cloak was fluttering, maybe the killer wasn't carrying anything heavy. But that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the key contradiction is between Moe's testimonies about seeing Max's symbols (silk hat, cloak) and Evidence 3 (the silk hat found at the scene). If Max was wearing the hat during the crime, then the hat should be with him, not left at the scene. But maybe he left it there, which isn't a contradiction. So that's possible.

Alternatively, the promo poster (Evidence 4) lists Max's symbols as silk hat, cloak, and white roses. If the crime scene had the hat and cloak (as per Moe's testimony), but no white roses, maybe that's a discrepancy. But the evidence doesn't mention white roses being present or absent. So that's not helpful.

Wait, the bust (Evidence 15) is a bronze statue of Max. If the murder weapon was the bust, then the killer used Max's bust to hit the victim. But Moe saw Max himself. If the bust was used, perhaps Max wasn't there, and the killer used the bust, making it look like Max was present via his symbols. But how does that contradict the testimony? It would mean Moe was mistaken, but that's not a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony.

Alternatively, the Scarf (Evidence 19) has pepper, which connects to the seasoning bottle (Evidence 13). Maybe Bat (in a coma) was involved, but how? If the pepper was used to distract the lion Léon, but that's another angle.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to approach this systematically. Each testimony from Moe (0-4) claims he saw Max's shadow, hat, cloak, etc. The key point is that Moe is identifying Max based on his clothing/symbols. Now, any evidence that shows that those symbols were not present at the scene, or that Max couldn't have been there.

Evidence 3: Silk Hat found at the scene. That supports Moe's testimony. So no contradiction there.

Evidence 4: Promo poster with Max's symbols. Also supports.

Evidence 15: Bust of Max taken from cafeteria. If the bust was used as the weapon, but Moe saw Max, that's not a contradiction unless the bust's presence implies Max wasn't there. Not directly.

Wait, maybe the bust's absence from the cafeteria (since it was taken before the crime) is important. If the bust was moved before the crime, and Moe saw Max at the crime scene, then Max would have needed to move the bust earlier. But that's possible.

Alternatively, the Ringmaster's Papers (Evidence 5) show Max got a raise, giving him a motive. Not a contradiction.

Wait, the note (Evidence 16) says "Meet at 10:00 PM tonight at the lodging house plaza." The time of death is 10:15 PM. So the Ringmaster went to meet someone at 10 PM. If Moe saw Max at that time, maybe Max was there. But if the meeting was at the lodging house plaza, and the crime scene is elsewhere (as per the map), perhaps the location contradicts. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows the victim in the snow, possibly at the lodging house plaza? The map says lodging house is on the right. If the crime scene is there, then Moe's testimony about seeing Max there would align. Not a contradiction.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the testimonies again. All of Moe's testimonies are about seeing Max's shadow and symbols. The key evidence that could contradict this would be something that proves Max wasn't there. For example, if there's evidence that Max was somewhere else at the time. But the evidences provided don't include an alibi for Max.

Wait, maybe the Grand Prix Photo (Evidence 14) is a clue. It's a photo of Max's award ceremony. If this photo was taken on the same night as the murder, that would place Max elsewhere. But the description of the photo doesn't mention the date or time. It just says it's a photo from the ceremony. So unless there's a date on the photo, we can't assume that. Therefore, this isn't a solid contradiction.

Alternatively, the Scarf (Evidence 19) has pepper and blood. The seasoning bottle (Evidence 13) has pepper. If the scarf belongs to Bat (who's in a coma), perhaps someone else used it. But how does that contradict Moe's testimony?

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Moe's Testimony 0 ("shadow could only have belonged to Max") and the fact that the bust (Evidence 15) is a statue of Max. So the shadow Moe saw could have been the bust being moved, not Max himself. But Moe insists it was Max's shadow. If the bust is a life-sized statue, then moving it could create a shadow resembling Max. That would mean Moe was mistaken, thinking it was Max when it was actually the bust. Therefore, the testimony contradicts the evidence that the bust was moved and could have been the source of the shadow.

So in this case, Moe's testimony about seeing Max's shadow (Testimony 0) is contradicted by Evidence 15 (the bust) because the bust, which is a statue of Max, could have been the actual object casting the shadow, not Max himself. Thus, the testimony and evidence contradict each other because the bust's presence at the crime scene (after being moved) suggests that the shadow could have been the bust, not Max.

Let's analyze the provided testimonies and evidences. Moe's testimonies (0-4) consistently claim he saw Max's shadow, identified by his silk hat and cloak. However, Evidence 15 (Max G. Bust) is a bronze statue of Max that was moved from the cafeteria before the crime. This suggests the shadow Moe saw could have been the bust being moved, not Max himself, contradicting Moe's assertion that the shadow "could only have belonged to Max."
{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 0}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let me go through each testimony and check against the evidence.

First, the characters are various circus people, the victim Russell Berry, and others. The evidences include things like the autopsy report, a broken bottle, a scarf, notes, etc. Testimonies are from Moe, the clown.

Looking at Testimony 0: Moe says, "There were no white roses that night!" Testimony 1 adds that all other symbols (except white roses) were there. Testimony 2 and 3 talk about the silk hat being present and Max wearing it the whole time.

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 4 is Max's promo poster which includes three symbols: silk hat, cloak, and white roses. If the promo poster includes white roses as a symbol, but Moe says there were no white roses that night (Testimony 0), that's a contradiction. Because the poster lists white roses as one of Max's symbols, but Moe claims they weren't present. However, maybe the testimony is about the actual event, while the poster is promotional material. If Max's symbols are supposed to be present during his performances, and Moe is testifying that white roses weren't there, but the promo poster (Evidence 4) lists them as part of his symbols, that's a conflict. Alternatively, maybe another evidence contradicts.

Wait, Evidence 3 is the Silk Hat found at the crime scene. Testimony 2 says the silk hat was there, which aligns with Evidence 3. But Testimony 0 and 1 talk about white roses. Evidence 4's promo poster includes white roses. So if Max's symbols include white roses, and Moe says there were none, then that's a contradiction between Testimony 0 and Evidence 4. Because the promo poster says white roses are part of his symbols, but Moe claims they weren't present. Therefore, Testimony 0 (Moe's statement about no white roses) contradicts Evidence 4 (poster listing white roses as a symbol). But wait, maybe the poster is promotional and doesn't necessarily mean they were present that night. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: Moe says Max was wearing the silk hat the entire time. But if the silk hat (Evidence 3) was found at the crime scene, that implies Max wasn't wearing it anymore. So if the hat was found at the scene, but Moe says Max was wearing it the whole time, that's a contradiction. Because if the hat was left at the crime scene, Max couldn't have been wearing it the entire time. That seems more direct. So Evidence 3 (Silk Hat found at crime scene) contradicts Testimony 3 (Max was wearing it the entire time). That's a solid contradiction because the hat can't be both on Max and at the crime scene.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 3 states that Max was wearing the silk hat the entire time he was on the scene. However, Evidence 3 (Silk Hat) is described as being "found at the crime scene." If the hat was found at the crime scene, Max couldn't have been wearing it the entire time, directly contradicting Moe's testimony.
{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 3}

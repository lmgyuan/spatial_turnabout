Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. I need to go through each testimony and check against the evidences.

First, looking at the testimonies from Ini (Testimony 0 to 5). Testimony 2 says Ini saw her sister, Mimi Miney, who supposedly died in a car accident a year ago. But according to Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2), Mimi Miney died in that accident. So Testimony 2 claims she saw her sister, but the evidence says Mimi is dead. That's a contradiction because the sister is deceased. But wait, maybe there's channeling involved since the Feys are spirit mediums. However, the testimony from Ini doesn't mention channeling, she just says she saw her sister, implying she's alive. So that's conflicting with Evidence 6.

Another possible contradiction: Testimony 4 says the sister's costume looked normal. But Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume) describes blood splatters and a bullet hole. If the sister (Mimi) was channeled into Maya's body, then the costume would be Maya's, which has blood. But Ini says the costume was normal. Hmm, but maybe she's referring to Mimi's appearance, not Maya's? Or perhaps the channeling would make the medium's appearance change. But the testimony says "her costume looked totally normal" which might refer to Mimi's usual attire. However, if Mimi was channeled through Maya, Maya's costume would be the one with blood. So if Ini saw Mimi (as a spirit in Maya's body), the costume would be Maya's, which has blood. But Testimony 4 says the costume looked normal. That might be a contradiction because the actual costume (Maya's) had blood. 

Wait, but Evidence 13 (Lotta's Photo 2) shows Maya in a blood-splattered robe holding the pistol. So if Ini saw her sister (Mimi) in Maya's body, the costume would be bloody, but Ini says the costume looked normal. That would contradict. So Testimony 4 (costume normal) vs Evidence 11 or 13 (bloody). 

But Testimony 4 is about the sister's costume, which if she's channeled, would be Maya's costume. Therefore, Ini's statement that the costume looked normal contradicts the evidence that Maya's costume had blood and a bullet hole. 

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (seeing Mimi) and Evidence 6 (Mimi is dead). But in the context of the game, channeling allows spirits to be present. However, if Ini's testimony is that she physically saw her sister, that's impossible if Mimi is dead. Unless channeling was involved, but the testimony doesn't mention that. So maybe that's the contradiction. 

But the user wants only one pair. Let's check which is more direct. The most straightforward contradiction is Testimony 2 (Ini saw her sister Mimi) vs Evidence 6 (Mimi died a year ago). Unless there's a channeling aspect, but unless explicitly stated, Ini shouldn't be able to see her dead sister unless through channeling, which might not be the case here. So that's a contradiction. 

Wait, but the description for Character 7 says Mimi died in a car accident. So Ini's testimony 2 claims she saw Mimi, who is dead. Unless she's channeling, but the testimony doesn't mention that. Therefore, Testimony 2 contradicts Evidence 6, which states Mimi is dead. 

Alternatively, another angle: Evidence 18 is Ini's driver's license photo. If the newspaper article (Evidence 6) says that in the accident, Ini was the one driving, but she claims her sister Mimi was driving. Wait, the article says: "If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney." But if Evidence 18 is a license photo of Ini, maybe implying she was the driver. But the article is from the newspaper clipping 2, which states that Mimi died in the crash, and Ini survived. So if Ini's license is present (Evidence 18), perhaps she was the actual driver, contradicting her testimony that Mimi was driving. But that's more about the accident, not the current testimonies given. The current testimonies are about the murder incident. 

So back to the original thought: Testimony 2 says Ini saw her sister, but Evidence 6 says Mimi is dead. Unless there's channeling, but in that case, the medium would be someone else (like Maya). So if Ini saw her sister, that would require channeling, but her testimony doesn't mention that. Therefore, Testimony 2 contradicts Evidence 6. 

But another possible contradiction: Testimony 0 says Ini was sleeping in the Side Room during the channeling. Evidence 1 (Guidemap) says the Side Room is east, requiring a winding path from the meditation room. But perhaps other evidence shows she couldn't be there? Not sure. 

Alternatively, looking at the autopsy report (Evidence 8): Dr. Grey was stabbed then shot. The pistol (Evidence 9) has Maya's and Grey's fingerprints, and two shots fired. The knife (Evidence 10) has Maya's prints. Maya's costume (Evidence 11) has blood and a bullet hole. The photos (12 and 13) show Maya with the pistol and blood. So Maya is implicated. If Ini's testimonies are about seeing her sister, perhaps channeling is involved. But if the contradiction is between Ini's testimony about her sister being there (alive) and the evidence that she's dead, that's a key point. 

So the answer would be Testimony 2 (Ini saw her sister) vs Evidence 6 (Mimi is dead).

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 2 states, "It was, like, oh my gawd, totally my sister!" implying Ini saw Mimi Miney. However, Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2) explicitly states that Mimi Miney died in a car accident one year prior. This directly contradicts Testimony 2, as Mimi should be deceased and unable to appear unless channeled, which the testimony does not mention.
{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to compare the provided testimonies and evidences to find a contradiction. The question asks for one pair where evidence and testimony contradict each other.

Looking at the testimonies, all of them are from Ini Miney (Testimonies 0-6). Let's go through each testimony and check against the evidence.

Testimony 6 says: "I, like, didn't have my license, so, like, I couldn't take over driving for her." Ini claims she didn't have her driver's license at the time of the accident, implying her sister Mimi was driving. However, Evidence 18 is a "License Photo: Ini's photo for her driver's license. Director Hotti's treasured possession." Wait, if Ini has a driver's license photo, that suggests she had a license. But the testimony says she didn't have a license. That seems contradictory. 

Wait, but the evidence is a photo for her driver's license. Does having a photo mean she actually had a valid license? Maybe she had a learner's permit or the photo was a fake. But according to Testimony 6, she didn't have a license, so she couldn't drive. However, the existence of the license photo (even if it's just a photo, maybe from a license) might indicate she had one. That's a contradiction. So Evidence 18 (License Photo) contradicts Testimony 6 where Ini says she didn't have a license. Therefore, this would be the pair.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 6 states that Ini Miney "didn't have [her] license" during the car accident, implying she couldn't drive. However, Evidence 18 is a "License Photo" described as "Ini's photo for her driver's license. Director Hotti's treasured possession." The existence of her driver's license photo directly contradicts her claim of not having a license at the time.
{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 6}
Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to find one pair where the evidence contradicts a testimony.

First, I should start by looking at all the testimonies and see what each one says. Then, check the evidence to see if any of them provide information that directly contradicts those statements.

Looking at the testimonies here, all of them are from Ini Miney (Testimony 0 to 5). Let's go through each one:

Testimony 0: "Like, around that time, I was, like, really close to getting my license." So Ini is saying she was close to getting her driver's license around the time of the accident (which was one year ago, as per Evidence 6).

Testimony 1: "My sis was, like, this totally big fan of cars and, like, really valued them." Her sister Mimi loved cars.

Testimony 2: "She, like, had just gotten this really shiny, bright red sports car." Mimi got a new red sports car.

Testimony 3: "My sis' new car was, like, a totally special model from England." The car was a special model from England.

Testimony 4: "She, like, would say things like, 'No way am I letting a newb drive my car!'" So Mimi wouldn't let a new driver (like Ini) drive her car.

Testimony 5: "So, like, that's why I ended up in the passenger's seat that night too." Because Mimi wouldn't let Ini drive, Ini was in the passenger seat during the accident.

Now, the evidence. Let's check Evidence 6, the Newspaper Clipping 2. It states that the accident involved Mimi Miney, who was the driver, and Ini was the passenger. The article quotes Ini as saying she was the one who was driving ("I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash..."), but then the article clarifies that if Ini is to be believed, the driver was her sister Mimi. Wait, but there's a contradiction here. According to the testimony, Ini was in the passenger seat because Mimi wouldn't let her drive. But in the newspaper article, Ini initially said she was driving (as per her quote), but then the article says that if Ini's account is correct, the driver was Mimi. That seems conflicting.

Wait, let me read Evidence 6 again carefully. The newspaper clipping says: "Mimi Miney, nurse at Grey Surgical Clinic, died after falling asleep at the wheel. Articles about the car accident. [...] The content is as follows: [...] -Ms. Ini Miney Holds Interview About Crash- 'I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash, and like, I woke up in a huge sea of flames. I was like, still half-asleep, but I opened the right door and like, got out. I don't, like, remember anything else.' -Doctor Lurking in the Shadows? If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney."

Wait, Ini's quote in the newspaper says she was the driver: she said she was tired, fell asleep, then crashed. But the article then says that if Ini's account is correct, the driver was Mimi. That seems contradictory. Because Ini's own statement in the article suggests she was driving, but the article's analysis says the driver was Mimi. But according to the testimonies from Ini (Testimony 5), she was in the passenger seat because Mimi wouldn't let her drive. So there's a contradiction here.

Wait, no. Let me parse this again. The newspaper article includes a quote from Ini where she says, "I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash..." So Ini is implying that she was the driver because she fell asleep, leading to the crash. But then the article's analysis says, "If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney." That seems contradictory. How can Ini's statement about falling asleep lead to the conclusion that Mimi was driving?

Ah, perhaps Ini is lying here. Because in the testimonies (Testimony 5), she says she was in the passenger seat, implying that Mimi was driving. But according to the newspaper clipping, Ini's own statement suggests she was driving. Therefore, the testimony (Testimony 5) says she was in the passenger seat, but the evidence (Newspaper Clipping 2, Evidence 6) includes her statement where she implies she was driving, which would mean she was the driver. That's a contradiction.

So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Ini was in the passenger seat) and Evidence 6 (Ini's quote implies she was driving, leading to the crash when she fell asleep). Therefore, the evidence (6) and testimony (5) contradict each other.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 5 states Ini Miney was in the passenger seat during the car accident, implying Mimi was driving. However, Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2) quotes Ini as saying she fell asleep before the crash ("I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep..."), which would imply she was the driver, contradicting her testimony about being a passenger. This inconsistency points to a contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 6.

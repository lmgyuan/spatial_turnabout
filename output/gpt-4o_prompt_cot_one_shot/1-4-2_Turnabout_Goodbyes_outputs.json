Cause: one bullet shot to the heart.

The autopsy report indicates the victim was shot once in the heart.\n2. Lotta's deposition mentions hearing two gunshots after midnight on 12/25.\n3. The pistol evidence states it was fired three times.\n\nThe key contradiction lies between Lotta's testimony (Testimony 7) and the evidence from the autopsy report. The autopsy report (Evidence 3) suggests a single gunshot wound, while Lotta's testimony (Testimony 7) implies there was more than one gunshot (since she heard another gunshot after the flash). \n\nThus, the contradiction is that it is stated in the autopsy report that there was only one shot, while Lotta is testifying about multiple shots in her deposition.\n\nHere is the JSON format for the identified contradiction:\n\n```json",

Which makes this a premeditated murder!\" provided by Gumshoe.\n\nNow, let's examine the evidences related to the knife:\n\n- Evidence 15, \"Knife\": It mentions that it bears the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints, and it has \"Gatewater\" engraved on it. This suggests the knife is from the Gatewater Hotel, where the murder took place, and does not necessarily need to have been bought by Engarde for this crime specifically.\n\nThe testimony claims a premeditated murder due to the alleged purchase of the knife by Engarde, but the evidence suggests the knife was simply from the hotel, contradicting the claim of purchase for the crime.\n\nTherefore, we have a contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 15.\n",

    "cot": "To solve this, let's examine the evidence and testimonies provided to find any contradictions.\n\n1. **Evidence 9 - Crime Photo:** The description notes that the victim is sitting in a samurai outfit with a knife in his chest. Additionally, a glass of tomato juice is nearby, untouched, and there’s a smashed vase with water.\n\n2. **Evidence 14 - Juan's Autopsy Report:** This indicates that the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf. The stabbing occurred after death.\n\n3. **Testimony 4 - Oldbag's Testimony:** Oldbag claims the Nickel Samurai costume was worn when the victim was stabbed.\n\nGiven that Juan was actually strangled to death and only stabbed afterward to potentially disguise the cause of death, Testimony 4 claiming that the Nickel Samurai stabbed Juan contradicts the Autopsy Report, which provides the real cause of death.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction exists between the autopsy report detailing strangulation as the cause of death and the testimony suggesting stabbing during the on-stage event in costume.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.\n\nThe testimonies from Trilo (Testimony 1 through Testimony 5) consistently state that he saw Maximillion Galactica (“Max”) at the scene that night. He is sure about it because Max was wearing his three specific symbols: the silk hat, cloak, and white roses.\n\nHowever, the evidence can point to a contradiction:\n- Evidence 2: Crime Photo shows footprints leading to the victim, which implies the presence of snow, thus cold weather.\n- Evidence 3: Silk Hat was found at the crime scene, supporting the claim that Max might have been there. But, Max is said to wear a cloak and white roses as symbols, which are not highlighted or disputed by any other evidence.\n- Evidence 11: Russell's Autopsy Report shows that Russell Berry died from blunt force trauma, not necessarily linking to Max since no specific weapon indicating Max's involvement is mentioned.\n\nLet's focus on the testimony that reinforces Max being seen and alleged evidence of his appearance:\n- Evidence 4: Max G. Promo Poster emphasizes Max’s three symbols, including the silk hat found at the scene.\n\nHowever, the contradiction arises from logistical expectations:\n- Evidence 15: Max G. Bust was taken from the cafeteria before the crime. If Max’s symbol elements were found at the scene but the actual bust, commonly mistaken or used as his likeness, was missing, it raises doubt about Trilo’s recognition of Max.\n  \nAdditionally:\n- Notice that Trilo's identification of Max relies heavily on seeing symbolic attire: silk hat, cloak (Evidence found with no indication of presence).\n\nLet's conclude by identifying a direct contradiction:\n- Testimony 5 asserts that someone wearing Max’s symbolic items can't be mistaken.\n- Contrasted to Evidence 2, where footprints in the snow exist without visible attire confirming Max's presence.\n  \nTrilo’s certainty on Max’s presence conflicts with Max's only distinct identity being removed prior to the crime (Evidence 15) despite the scene’s presence (Evidence 3).\n\nThe most direct contradiction lies here:\n- Evidence 2 suggests the presence traced by evidence (footprints).\n- Testimony 1 insists Max’s presence (“I saw Max in the plaza”).\n\nThe contradiction highlights the incorrect attribution of a figure (likely due to the bust removal), thereby undermining Testimony 5's certainty.\n",

Given how the death reportedly occurred quickly after consuming poison, if Brushel was indeed there at 9:00 PM when Drew Misham supposedly died, it's inconsistent with him continuing the interview or not observing immediate severe symptoms right away.\n\nTherefore, the evidence that contradicts this testimony is:\n",

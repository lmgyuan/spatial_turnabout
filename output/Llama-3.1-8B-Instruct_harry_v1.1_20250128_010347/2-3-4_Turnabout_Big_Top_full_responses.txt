The Max G. Bust (Evidence 15) and Acro's Testimony (Testimony 2) contradict each other. 
Acro's Testimony (Testimony 2) claims that it would have been impossible for him to lift the bust and look out of the window, but the Max G. Bust (Evidence 15) is described as a bronze statue that looks rather heavy, suggesting that it may have been possible for Acro to lift it.

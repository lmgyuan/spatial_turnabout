Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to find a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony. Let's start by looking at the testimonies provided and cross-referencing them with the evidence.

First, let's list out the testimonies. The testimonies are all from Will Powers (Testimony 0 to 5). He talks about seeing a bellboy coming out of Juan Corrida's room, which he found suspicious because the bellboy was empty-handed, leading him to conclude the bellboy was the assassin.

Now, looking at the evidence, there's Evidence 30: Bellboy's Uniform. The description mentions that it's "Worn by De Killer on the night of the murder. One of its special buttons is missing." Additionally, Evidence 17 is Lotta's Photo, which shows a person in samurai garb outside the door after the murder. 

Wait, but the key point here is the contradiction. The testimonies from Powers suggest the bellboy (De Killer) was the assassin. However, Evidence 30 states that the Bellboy's Uniform was worn by De Killer and that a button is missing. But in the Guitar Case (Evidence 7), there's a Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) found in Engarde's hakama. That might not directly contradict the testimony, though.

Wait, the testimonies mention the bellboy coming out of the room, but the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record the victim's room from 8 PM for 1 hour. If the murder happened at 8:15 PM (from Juan's Autopsy Report, Evidence 14), then the spy camera should have recorded the events. However, the Video Tape (Evidence 29) retrieved from De Killer's hideout might have the footage, but the problem is that the testimonies say the bellboy was the assassin, but the Spy Camera's existence suggests that the real culprit might be caught on tape. However, perhaps the contradiction is more direct.

Wait, Testimony 1 states that Powers saw the bellboy come out of Corrida's room. However, if the Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30) is missing a button, and the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) was found in Engarde's hakama, that could link Engarde. But maybe that's not the direct contradiction.

Alternatively, let's look at the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14): the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife. However, the testimonies from Powers suggest the bellboy (De Killer) was the assassin, but De Killer is known to leave a Shelly card (Evidence 13's description mentions Shelly de Killer always leaves a card). However, Evidence 18 is the Picture Card placed next to the victim, which Ms. Andrews was carrying. Wait, Evidence 18's description says the Picture Card was placed next to the victim and Ms. Andrews was carrying it. That could imply that the card was from Andrews, not De Killer, which would contradict the expectation that De Killer leaves his card. But the problem is that Shelly de Killer (Character 13) is known to leave a Shelly card, but Evidence 18 is a Picture Card that Andrews had. So if the Picture Card is supposed to be De Killer's calling card, but it's actually linked to Andrews, that's a contradiction. However, the testimony from Powers is about seeing the bellboy (De Killer) as the assassin, but the presence of the Picture Card linked to Andrews might contradict that. But maybe that's not the direct contradiction.

Alternatively, let's consider the time of death. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) states time of death at 8:15 PM. The Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording from 8 PM for 1 hour. If the camera was running, it should have captured the murder. However, the Video Tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout might have the real footage. If Powers claims to have seen the bellboy leaving the room around the time of the murder, but the camera footage would show otherwise, but since the camera's existence is evidence, perhaps there's a contradiction here. However, the answer needs to be a direct contradiction between a specific testimony and evidence.

Wait, let's look at Testimony 5: "Yeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!" referring to the bellboy. However, the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. The cause of death was stabbing, and the knife used has Engarde's prints. If the testimonies point to the bellboy (De Killer) as the assassin, but the murder weapon has Engarde's prints, that's a contradiction. But the autopsy says the cause was strangulation first, then stabbing. The knife with Engarde's prints is the murder weapon for the stabbing, but if De Killer (as the bellboy) was the assassin, why does the knife have Engarde's prints? That would contradict the testimony that the bellboy was the assassin, since the knife used belongs to Engarde.

Alternatively, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording during the murder. If Powers' testimony says he saw the bellboy leaving the room, but the camera footage might show someone else, like Engarde. However, the Video Tape (29) is from De Killer's hideout, and its contents are unknown. Maybe the Spy Camera's existence and the Video Tape could contradict, but that's speculative.

Wait, the key contradiction here is between Testimony 5 (Powers claiming the bellboy is the assassin) and the Knife (Evidence 15) having Engarde's fingerprints. Since the knife was used in the stabbing part of the murder, and it's linked to Engarde, not De Killer, that contradicts the testimony that the bellboy (De Killer) was the assassin. Therefore, the testimony that the bellboy was the assassin (Testimony 5) is contradicted by the knife having Engarde's prints (Evidence 15).

Alternatively, the Autopsy Report (14) states cause of death as strangulation and stabbing. If De Killer is a professional assassin who uses a pistol (as per his character description), but the murder was done with a knife and strangulation, that might contradict. But Shelly de Killer's methods aren't specified here beyond leaving a card, so maybe not.

Wait, the Shelly card is mentioned in Evidence 18, but the Picture Card was carried by Andrews. So if the card at the scene is linked to Andrews, not De Killer, that contradicts the idea that De Killer left his card. But the testimony is about the bellboy being the assassin, not about the card. So perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (bellboy is assassin) and Evidence 15 (knife with Engarde's prints). Therefore, the testimony that the bellboy is the assassin is contradicted by the knife used having Engarde's fingerprints, implying Engarde's involvement.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states that Will Powers is sure the bellboy (De Killer) was the assassin. However, Evidence 15, the "Knife," which has the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints, directly links the murder weapon to Matt Engarde, contradicting the testimony that the bellboy was the perpetrator.
{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this. The question is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. There's a lot to go through here, so I need to be methodical.

First, let's look at the testimonies. All of them are from Shelly de Killer. Testimonies 0 to 6. The main points from his testimonies are that Adrian Andrews is his client, he can't overlook tampering with the crime scene, his client framed someone else, they pretended to discover the body first, Andrews knew Corrida was dead already, and that the creation/planting of the knife and button was against the rules.

Now, looking at the evidence. The key ones here might be related to the knife and button. Evidence 15 is the Knife with Engarde's fingerprints. Evidence 16 is the Jammin' Ninja's Button found in Engarde's hakama. Then there's Evidence 21, the Spy Camera that was recording during the murder. Also, the Autopsy Report (14) says Corrida was strangled first, then stabbed. The Video Tape (29) from De Killer's hideout, and the Bellboy's Uniform (30) missing a button.

De Killer's Testimony 5 says that the knife and button were created and planted by his client to frame someone. However, if the knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints and the button (16) is from Corrida's costume found in Engarde's clothing, that would support the framing. But wait, De Killer claims that his client (Adrian Andrews?) planted these. But if there's evidence that contradicts the possibility of planting, then that's the contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 21 is the Spy Camera set to record the victim's room from 8 PM for 1 hour, which covers the time of death at 8:15 PM. If the camera was running, maybe the footage would show who was there. But De Killer's Testimony 3 and 4 say that Andrews pretended to discover the body and knew Corrida was dead already. If the Spy Camera footage shows something different, like the actual murder, that would contradict the testimonies. Alternatively, if the Spy Camera was planted by someone else, but the receipt (24) shows Engarde bought the stuffed bear with the camera, so Engarde set it up. But De Killer's client is supposed to be Andrews, but if the Spy Camera was set by Engarde, maybe that's conflicting.

Wait, the Spy Camera (21) is in the stuffed bear (23), and the receipt (24) shows Engarde bought an identical bear. So Engarde set up the camera. If the camera was recording, maybe it captured the real murderer, which might contradict De Killer's claim that his client (Andrews) framed someone. But De Killer's testimony 5 says that the knife and button were planted. But the knife has Engarde's prints, and the button is in Engarde's clothing. If the Spy Camera's footage shows that Engarde wasn't there, then that would mean the evidence (knife and button) were planted, which is what De Killer is saying. But maybe the Spy Camera's existence contradicts the testimony?

Alternatively, the Autopsy Report (14) says cause of death was strangulation followed by stabbing. But De Killer's Testimony 4 says Andrews knew Corrida was dead already, implying she was involved. But if the Spy Camera recorded the murder, maybe it shows the real killer, which is someone else. But this is getting a bit convoluted.

Wait, let's focus on Testimony 5: "the creation and planting of the 'knife' and 'button'." If the knife (15) has Engarde's fingerprints and the button (16) is in his clothing, but De Killer says those were planted by his client (Andrews), then maybe the evidence contradicts that. But how? Unless there's evidence that the knife couldn't have been planted.

Alternatively, the Spy Camera (21) was recording during the murder. If the footage from the camera shows that the knife was already there when the murder happened, or that Engarde wasn't present, that would mean the knife was planted later. But the problem is we don't have the actual footage as evidence, just the existence of the camera. But the testimony says that the client (Andrews) planted the knife and button. If the camera was recording, and the knife wasn't present during the murder, then that supports the planting. However, the existence of the camera might contradict the ability to plant the evidence without being recorded. Wait, but the camera was in the stuffed bear in the victim's room. If someone entered later to plant the knife, the camera would have recorded them. But the testimonies say that Andrews was the one who planted the evidence while pretending to discover the body. If the camera was still recording when she entered, then her planting the evidence would be on camera. But according to De Killer's testimony, she did plant them. However, if the Spy Camera's existence is known, but the footage isn't presented, maybe there's a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the fact that the Spy Camera exists and was operational contradicts the claim that the knife was planted, because the footage would show the real events.

Alternatively, looking at the Autopsy Report (14): the cause of death was strangulation first, then stabbing. But the knife (15) is the murder weapon with Engarde's prints. However, the autopsy says the stabbing was after strangulation. If the knife was planted, maybe the real cause of death was the strangulation, and the stabbing was post-mortem. But the testimony says the knife was planted to frame Engarde. So the autopsy report supports that the stabbing was part of the murder, but if the knife was planted, then the actual cause of death would have been the strangulation, which is part of the murder. But I'm not sure if that's a contradiction.

Wait, another angle: De Killer's Testimony 5 says that the knife and button were created and planted. If the knife (Evidence 15) is the actual murder weapon, then maybe the fingerprints on it contradict the idea that it was planted. Because if Engarde's prints are on it, but he wasn't there (as per the Spy Camera), then that's a contradiction. But the Spy Camera's footage isn't part of the evidence, only the existence of the camera. Alternatively, the Spy Camera's existence (Evidence 21) is in the room where the murder happened. If the camera was recording, then it would have captured the murderer. If the murderer was someone else, but the knife with Engarde's prints is there, that would imply the knife was planted. However, De Killer's testimony says that the client (Andrews) planted the knife and button. So maybe the Spy Camera's existence as evidence doesn't directly contradict, but perhaps another piece does.

Alternatively, the Bellboy's Uniform (30) is missing a button, which might relate to the Jammin' Ninja's Button (16). But if the button found in Engarde's hakama is from Corrida's costume, but the Bellboy's Uniform is missing a button, maybe there's a connection. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The key contradiction should be between a testimony and a specific evidence. De Killer's Testimony 5 states that the knife and button were planted. However, if the knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, which would be expected if he used it, but if the Spy Camera (21) was recording and would show that Engarde wasn't present, then the presence of his prints would imply the knife was planted. But since the camera's footage is not part of the evidence, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Alternatively, the Autopsy Report (14) states that the victim was strangled first and then stabbed. If the knife was planted to make it look like a stabbing, but the actual cause of death includes strangulation, then maybe the presence of the knife as the murder weapon contradicts that. But the autopsy says both causes contributed. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 4: Adrian Andrews already knew Corrida was dead. If the Spy Camera was recording, maybe the footage shows that she entered the room after the murder, which would support that she knew. But that's not a contradiction. Wait, the question is to find evidence and testimony that contradict each other. So the testimony says that Andrews planted the knife and button. But if the knife was found with Engarde's prints, and the Spy Camera's existence (Evidence 21) shows that Engarde set up the camera, which is in the stuffed bear (23) that he bought (Evidence 24), then perhaps Engarde was involved in setting up the camera, which could conflict with the idea that Andrews planted the knife. Because if Engarde set up the camera, maybe he was trying to record something, but if Andrews planted the knife, maybe the camera would have evidence of that. But this is speculative.

Wait, another angle: The knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. If De Killer's Testimony 5 says that the knife was planted by Andrews, then how did Engarde's prints get on it unless he actually handled it. If Andrews planted it, then she would have had to forge the prints or Engarde touched it earlier. But if the prints are legit, that would mean Engarde did handle the knife, contradicting the testimony that it was planted. So if the knife has Engarde's prints, and the testimony says it was planted by Andrews, that's a contradiction because the prints would suggest Engarde used it, not that it was planted. Therefore, Evidence 15 (Knife) contradicts Testimony 5.

But wait, De Killer's Testimony 5 says that the client (Andrews) created and planted the knife. If the knife has Engarde's prints, it's possible that Andrews planted a knife that Engarde had previously touched. So maybe that's not a contradiction. Alternatively, if the knife was created (i.e., fabricated) by Andrews, then it shouldn't have Engarde's real prints. But if the prints are genuine, that implies Engarde did handle the knife, which could mean he's the killer, which contradicts the testimony that Andrews framed him by planting the knife. But De Killer's testimony is that the client (Andrews) framed another person (probably Engarde) by planting the knife. So the presence of Engarde's prints on the knife would support that he was framed, which is what the testimony is saying. So that's not a contradiction.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look for another contradiction. Testimony 4: Adrian Andrews already knew Corrida was dead. If there's evidence that shows she couldn't have known, but I don't see such evidence. Evidence 14 (Autopsy) says time of death 8:15 PM. If Andrews was elsewhere, but no alibi evidence is listed here.

Wait, the Spy Camera (21) was recording the room from 8 PM for an hour. The murder happened at 8:15 PM. The Video Tape (29) is from De Killer's hideout, but its contents are unknown. If the Spy Camera's footage would show the real killer, but since it's not part of the evidence, maybe the existence of the camera itself is the key. If the camera was there, then the killer would have been recorded, but De Killer's testimony says Andrews planted the evidence. So if the camera was operational, then planting the evidence would be recorded, but the testimony says she did it. Unless the camera was tampered with. But there's no evidence here that the camera was tampered with.

Alternatively, the Jammin' Ninja's Button (16) is found in Engarde's hakama. If De Killer's testimony says it was planted, but the button is from Corrida's costume, which would have been ripped off during a struggle. If the button was planted, then maybe the location where it was found contradicts that. But without more info, it's hard.

Wait, looking back at the Autopsy Report (14): the victim was strangled, then stabbed. The knife (15) has blood and Engarde's prints. If the stabbing was post-mortem, then the knife wouldn't have the victim's blood, but the evidence says it does. Wait, no, if he was strangled first, then stabbed, the stabbing would still cause bleeding. So the blood on the knife is consistent. But if the knife was planted after the fact, then the blood would have to be applied, but the evidence says it's the victim's blood. So if the knife was the actual murder weapon, then planting it would mean the killer used it, but De Killer's testimony says the client (Andrews) planted it. So maybe the presence of the victim's blood on the knife supports that it's the real weapon, contradicting the testimony that it was a planted fake. But the testimony says the client created and planted the knife, implying it's a fake. But if the knife has the victim's blood, then it's the real weapon, so the testimony is contradicted. Therefore, Evidence 15 (Knife) contradicts Testimony 5.

Yes, that makes sense. If the knife was created (i.e., a fake) and planted by Andrews, but the actual knife used in the crime has the victim's blood and Engarde's prints, then the evidence shows it's the real murder weapon, contradicting the testimony that it was a planted fake. Therefore, Evidence 15 and Testimony 5 contradict each other.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 5 states that the knife and button were created and planted to frame someone. However, Evidence 15, the Knife, bears the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints, indicating it was the actual murder weapon used in the crime, not a fabricated item. This contradicts the claim that the knife was merely planted.
{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts which testimony here. Let's start by looking at the testimonies and the evidences provided.

The testimonies are all from Shelly de Killer. Testimony 3 says he was supposed to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews. Now, looking at the evidences, Evidence 25 is the Figurine, which is described as a wooden bear-shaped puzzle that only Corrida and Andrews know how to open. But if de Killer was supposed to give it to Andrews, but the figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews, maybe there's a contradiction here. Wait, but maybe that's not the contradiction. Let me check another part.

Testimony 2 mentions that the request included the murder of Juan Corrida and "2 or 3 other small things," one of which is giving the figurine to Andrews. Now, looking at Evidence 27, which is Celeste's Suicide Note found inside the Figurine. The note tells of Engarde's misdeeds. If de Killer was supposed to give the figurine to Andrews, but the note inside incriminates Engarde, perhaps there's a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the figurine's ownership is an issue. Wait, Evidence 25 states that only Corrida and Andrews know how to open it. If de Killer was tasked with giving it to Andrews, maybe there's a contradiction if the figurine was already in a place that only those two could access, but how does that tie in?

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 27. Because if de Killer was supposed to give the figurine to Andrews, but the figurine contains Celeste's suicide note that implicates Engarde, perhaps the existence of the note inside the figurine contradicts de Killer's testimony about his task. Alternatively, maybe the key point is that the Figurine (Evidence 25) is a puzzle only Corrida and Andrews can open, so how could de Killer retrieve it unless he had help? But his testimony says he was supposed to find it. If only Corrida and Andrews know how to open it, maybe de Killer couldn't have found it on his own, contradicting his testimony that he was supposed to find it. But wait, the testimony says "find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews." If the figurine was already in the possession of someone else, perhaps there's a contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 25's description: "A wooden puzzle with a hollow inside. Only Corrida and Andrews know how to open it." If de Killer was supposed to find it, but it's something only those two can open, maybe he couldn't have retrieved the contents (the suicide note) unless he had help. But the testimony doesn't mention opening it, just finding and giving it. So perhaps that's not the contradiction.

Wait, let's check other evidences. Evidence 24 is a receipt showing Engarde bought a stuffed bear identical to the one in evidence (the spy camera bear). Evidence 21 is the Spy Camera set in the stuffed bear. Maybe there's a connection there. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Testimony 4 says de Killer thought the client was a man based on the letter's name. The client could be Engarde, who is male. That seems consistent. Maybe not a contradiction here.

Looking at the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14): Juan was strangled and stabbed. The Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's prints. Testimony 2 says de Killer was hired for the murder. But the murder method here might involve Engarde's knife. But maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, Testimony 3 says de Killer was to give the figurine to Adrian Andrews. But Evidence 27 (Celeste's Suicide Note) is inside the figurine, which would incriminate Engarde. If de Killer's job was to give the figurine to Andrews, but the note inside would reveal Engarde's guilt, then perhaps that's a contradiction because Engarde would be incriminating himself. But maybe the client is Engarde, and he wanted the figurine given to Andrews to frame her. However, if the note inside the figurine is about Engarde's misdeeds, giving it to Andrews would expose him. That seems contradictory if Engarde was the client. So maybe de Killer's testimony about giving the figurine to Andrews (Testimony 3) is contradicted by Evidence 27 (the suicide note inside it), implying that the client's instructions would lead to their own exposure. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 27? But Evidence 27 is the suicide note inside the figurine, which is only known if the figurine is opened. Since de Killer was supposed to give the closed figurine to Andrews, maybe there's no direct contradiction. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) and the Video Tape (Evidence 29). The spy camera was recording during the murder. The Video Tape is from de Killer's hideout. If the Video Tape contains footage from the spy camera, which shows the murder, then Testimony 2 (that de Killer was hired for the murder) might be contradicted if the footage shows someone else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 2 says the request included the murder and other things, including giving the figurine to Andrews. Evidence 25's Figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews. If de Killer was supposed to retrieve the figurine, but only Corrida and Andrews could open it, then perhaps he couldn't have retrieved it unless one of them gave it to him. But since Corrida is dead, maybe Andrews had to help. But if the client is Engarde, as implied, then how would Engarde know about the figurine? This might not directly contradict.

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 2 stating that the request included "the murder of Juan Corrida and 2 or 3 other small things" and Evidence 14's Autopsy Report, which states the cause of death as strangulation and stabbing. However, de Killer is a professional assassin, so if he was hired to kill Corrida, but the actual cause of death includes a stabbing with Engarde's knife (Evidence 15), which has Engarde's fingerprints, then perhaps de Killer's testimony about committing the murder contradicts the evidence that Engarde's knife was used. But Testimony 2 says de Killer was hired for the murder, so if the murder was actually carried out by someone else (Engarde), then that's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 15 (Knife with Engarde's prints) contradicts Testimony 2 (de Killer claiming he was hired for the murder). But wait, de Killer could have framed Engarde by using his knife. So maybe not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 4 says de Killer thought the client was a man based on the letter's name. If the client's name was, say, Adrian Andrews (a woman), but the name at the end of the letter made him think it was a man, then perhaps the client is actually a woman, which would contradict. But the magazine clipping (Evidence 11) suggests Adrian Andrews was having a scandal with Corrida. If the client was Adrian, but de Killer thought it was a man, that's a contradiction. But how does that tie to evidence? Maybe Evidence 18 (Picture Card) which was placed next to the victim and carried by Andrews. If de Killer's client was a man, but Andrews had the card, maybe there's a contradiction. Not sure.

Wait, going back to Testimony 3: de Killer was to give the figurine to Adrian Andrews. Evidence 25 says the figurine can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews. So if de Killer gave it to Andrews, she could open it. But Evidence 27 is the suicide note inside the figurine, which incriminates Engarde. If de Killer's client was Engarde, then why would Engarde want to give Andrews evidence against himself? That seems contradictory. Therefore, Testimony 3 (de Killer's task to give the figurine to Andrews) contradicts the contents of the figurine (Evidence 27), which would harm Engarde if Andrews opened it. Therefore, the client (Engarde) wouldn't want that, so de Killer's testimony about his task contradicts the evidence that the figurine contains a note against Engarde. So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 27.

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is that the Figurine (Evidence 25) can only be opened by Corrida and Andrews, but de Killer was supposed to retrieve it. If Corrida was dead, only Andrews could open it, but de Killer couldn't have retrieved it unless Andrews helped, which contradicts if he was working against her.

Hmm. Alternatively, Testimony 3 says de Killer was supposed to find the figurine and give it to Andrews. But Evidence 25 states that the figurine is a puzzle only they can open. If the client (say, Engarde) wanted de Killer to give it to Andrews, but Engarde wouldn't know how to open it, maybe there's a contradiction. But not directly.

Wait, Evidence 27 is the suicide note inside the figurine. If de Killer was supposed to give the figurine to Andrews, and the note inside implicates Engarde, then this would mean that Engarde (if he's the client) is providing evidence against himself, which is contradictory. Therefore, Testimony 3 (de Killer's task to give the figurine) contradicts Evidence 27 (the note inside), implying that the client wouldn't have ordered that if they were Engarde. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 27.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 3 states that Shelly de Killer was instructed to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews. However, Evidence 27 (Celeste's Suicide Note) is found inside the figurine, which incriminates Matt Engarde. If de Killer's client was Engarde (as implied by other context), this task contradicts the evidence, as providing the figurine to Andrews would expose Engarde's guilt.
{"evidence": 27, "testimony": 3}

Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through the characters, evidences, and testimonies provided.

First, the characters. There's Maya Fey, Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, and others, but the key ones here might be related to the DL-6 Incident, which seems to be a recurring theme. The victim is Robert Hammond, who was the defense attorney in the DL-6 case. Manfred von Karma is the prosecutor, and there's Yanni Yogi as the caretaker. 

Looking at the evidences, there are a few key pieces. Evidence 3 is the Autopsy Report for Robert Hammond, stating he was shot in the heart, time of death on the 24th or 25th. Evidence 18 is the DL-6 Case File, which mentions the murder weapon was fired twice. Evidence 10 is the Pistol, which was fired 3 times and has Edgeworth's prints. Evidence 21 is the DL-6 Bullet from Gregory Edgeworth's heart. Then there's Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) where she heard two gunshots after midnight on 12/25. Also, the DL-6 Incident Photo (Evidence 19) shows a bullet hole in the door.

Now, the testimonies are all from Edgeworth. Testimony 5 says there was a single gunshot, then a scream. Testimony 6 mentions the scream. But according to the DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18), the murder weapon was fired twice. Additionally, the Pistol (Evidence 10) was fired three times. However, Edgeworth's testimony says there was a single gunshot. That seems contradictory. The DL-6 Incident's murder weapon was fired twice, but in the current case, the pistol was fired three times. But wait, the DL-6 Incident is a past case, and the current case involves Robert Hammond's death. 

Wait, the testimonies here might be Edgeworth recounting the DL-6 Incident. If in his testimony (Testimony 5) he says there was a single gunshot, but the DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18) states the weapon was fired twice, that's a contradiction. Also, the DL-6 Bullet (Evidence 21) is from Gregory's heart, and the murder weapon in DL-6 was fired twice. So Edgeworth's testimony of a single gunshot in the DL-6 incident contradicts the evidence that it was fired twice. Therefore, Testimony 5 (single gunshot) contradicts Evidence 18 (murder weapon fired twice). That's the pair.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 5 states, "A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream." However, Evidence 18 (DL-6 Case File) notes the murder weapon "was fired twice" during the DL-6 Incident. This contradicts Edgeworth's claim of hearing only one gunshot.
{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 5}

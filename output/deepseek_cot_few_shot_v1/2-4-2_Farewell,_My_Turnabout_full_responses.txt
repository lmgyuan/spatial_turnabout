Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. Alright, so first, I need to go through the testimonies and the evidences one by one to see where there's a conflict.

Looking at the testimonies, there are five from Gumshoe. Testimony 4 says that the defendant's (Matt Engarde) fingerprints were on the knife. Then Testimony 5 claims that Engarde bought the knife for the crime, making it premeditated. 

Now, checking the evidence related to the knife. Evidence 15 is the Knife, which states it has Engarde's fingerprints and the victim's blood. So that lines up with Testimony 4. But wait, Testimony 5 says he bought the knife. Let me check if there's evidence about purchasing the knife. Evidence 24 is a Credit Card Receipt for $3,800 for a stuffed bear identical to the one used as a spy camera. That's about a stuffed bear, not the knife. Hmm, maybe the knife's origin is important. The knife's description mentions "Gatewater" engraved on the grip. But is there evidence that Engarde bought this specific knife?

Wait, the receipt (Evidence 24) is for a stuffed bear, not the knife. So Testimony 5 claims Engarde bought the knife, but there's no evidence directly showing he purchased it. However, Evidence 15 does have his fingerprints. But the contradiction might be elsewhere. Let me check other parts.

Looking at the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14): cause of death is strangulation with a scarf first, then stabbed. But the testimonies focus on the knife. The knife being the murder weapon, but the actual cause includes strangulation. But the testimony doesn't mention that. Maybe not the direct contradiction here.

Wait, Testimony 5 says Engarde bought the knife for the crime. But the knife's evidence (15) mentions it's engraved with "Gatewater", which might be the hotel's name. If the knife is from the hotel, maybe Engarde didn't buy it but took it from there. Alternatively, maybe the receipt for the bear is unrelated, but the prosecution is claiming he bought the knife. If there's no evidence of him purchasing the knife, then Testimony 5 contradicts that. But I need to check if any evidence directly shows he bought the knife. The only purchase mentioned is the stuffed bear in Evidence 24, which is a different item. Therefore, Testimony 5's claim that Engarde bought the knife might contradict the lack of evidence supporting that purchase. However, maybe the knife is from the hotel, so he didn't need to buy it. So Testimony 5's assertion that he bought it for the crime might conflict with the fact that the knife is linked to the hotel (Gatewater engraved) and not a purchased item. 

Wait, Evidence 15 says the knife has "Gatewater" engraved, which might mean it's property of the hotel. So if Engarde bought the knife, why would it have the hotel's name? That suggests the knife was from the hotel, not something he purchased. Therefore, Testimony 5's claim that he bought the knife for the crime contradicts Evidence 15's engraving, implying the knife was already at the hotel. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 15.

Let's think step by step:
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states that the defendant bought the knife for the crime, implying premeditation. However, Evidence 15, the "Knife," is engraved with "Gatewater," suggesting it belongs to the hotel rather than being purchased by Engarde. This contradicts the claim that Engarde specifically acquired the knife for the murder.
{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's take a look at the problem here. So, there are a bunch of characters, evidence, and testimonies provided. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The answer needs to be in a JSON format with the evidence and testimony numbers.

First, I need to go through each testimony and cross-reference them with the evidence to find inconsistencies. Let's start with the testimonies. 

Looking at the Testimonies section, there are several from Oldbag (Testimony 0 to 5). Testimony 4 states: "It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!" And Testimony 5 adds: "He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show." So Oldbag claims she saw Matt Engarde leaving the victim's room wearing his racing jacket.

Now, check the evidences. Evidence 17 is "Lotta's Photo: Picture taken in the Hallway right after the murder. A person in samurai garb stands outside the door." Wait, samurai garb? If Oldbag saw Engarde in a racing jacket, but the photo shows someone in samurai clothing, that's a contradiction. Because the photo from the crime scene right after the murder shows a person in samurai outfit, not a racing jacket. So Oldbag's testimony about the jacket doesn't align with the photo evidence.

But let's confirm the other details. Evidence 2 is "The Nickel Samurai: A glossy photo... describing the nickel samurai costume." Matt Engarde plays the Nickel Samurai, so his costume would be samurai garb. However, Testimony 5 says he was in a racing jacket. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) mentions the victim in a samurai outfit, but the person in Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17) is also in samurai garb. If the person leaving was in samurai garb, but Oldbag claims it was Engarde in a racing jacket, that's conflicting. 

Also, Evidence 15 is the Knife with Engarde's fingerprints, which might support his involvement, but the immediate contradiction is between the clothing described in the testimony versus the photo evidence. So Testimony 4/5 (depending on numbering) contradicts Evidence 17. Wait, Testimony 4 and 5 are both part of the same testimony set. Let me check the numbering again.

The Testimonies are numbered 0 to 5. Testimony 4 is where Oldbag says she saw Engarde coming out of the room, and Testimony 5 adds that he was wearing a racing jacket. The key contradiction here is that the photo (Evidence 17) shows someone in samurai garb, not a racing jacket. Therefore, Oldbag's testimony about the jacket conflicts with the photo evidence showing a different outfit. 

So the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (or 5?) and Evidence 17. Let me check the exact testimony numbers. Testimony 4 is the claim about Engarde exiting, and Testimony 5 specifies the clothing. So the contradiction is with Testimony 5, but since the problem allows only one pair, perhaps it's Testimony 4 that's contradicted by Evidence 17. Alternatively, maybe Testimony 3 says someone came out, Testimony 4 identifies as Engarde, and Testimony 5 describes the jacket. The photo (Evidence 17) shows someone in samurai garb, which would be the Nickel Samurai costume, not a racing jacket. So the testimony about the jacket (Testimony 5) contradicts the photo evidence (17). However, maybe the actual contradiction is between the presence of Engarde leaving the room (Testimony 4) and the photo showing someone else's outfit. 

Alternatively, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) states the cause of death as strangulation and then stabbing. But maybe another contradiction exists. Let me check other possibilities. 

Another angle: Testimony 4 claims Engarde was leaving the room, but the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording the room from 8 PM for an hour. If the murder happened at 8:15 PM, the camera footage might show something different. However, the user might not have enough info about the video's content. Alternatively, the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but his testimony (if any) says he didn't touch it. Wait, the testimonies provided here are all from Oldbag. The defendant's testimonies might be elsewhere, but in this case, the testimonies given are from Oldbag. So the main contradiction is between Oldbag's description of Engarde's clothing and the photo evidence showing samurai garb. 

Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo) contradicting Testimony 5 (about the racing jacket). But I need to confirm the testimony numbers. Testimony 5 is "He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show." So the JSON should be {"evidence": 17, "testimony": 5}.

Let's think step by step:
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states, "He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show." However, Evidence 17, "Lotta's Photo," shows a person in samurai garb outside the door, contradicting the claim about the racing jacket.
{"evidence": 17, "testimony": 5}
Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies here. Let's start by going through each testimony and checking the evidence to see if there's a conflict.

First, looking at the testimonies. All of them are from Oldbag, the Security Lady (Character 3). Her testimonies are all about seeing the Nickel Samurai (Matt Engarde) commit the murder. Specifically:

- Testimony 1: She saw the Nickel Samurai.
- Testimony 4: She claims he wore the costume during the murder to go to the stage show afterward.

Now, let's check the evidence. The key evidence here might relate to the actual time of death or the murderer's identity. Evidence 21 is the Spy Camera set to record the victim's room from 8 PM for 1 hour, which was running at the time of the murder. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) states the time of death as 8:15 PM. 

Wait, but how does that relate to the testimony? Oldbag says Engarde was in the costume committing the murder, but if the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording the room, maybe the footage shows something different. However, the Video Tape (Evidence 29) retrieved from De Killer's hideout might have the actual footage. But the user's answer needs to pick one pair. 

Alternatively, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim was stabbed with a knife. However, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) says cause of death was strangulation first, then stabbing. But that's about the method, not the perpetrator. 

Looking at Testimony 4: Oldbag says Engarde wore the costume when stabbing. But Evidence 14 says the victim was strangled first. So the actual cause of death isn't the stabbing, which might contradict the testimony that the stabbing was the murder. But the testimony's focus is on who did it, not the method. 

Wait, maybe the Spy Camera's footage would show someone else. But the problem is that the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) and the Video Tape (Evidence 29) might show that the killer wasn't Engarde. However, the user hasn't mentioned the contents of the Video Tape, only that it's from De Killer's hideout. 

Alternatively, the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) found in Engarde's hakama might link him, but that supports the testimony. The contradiction must be elsewhere. 

Wait, Testimony 1 says Oldbag saw the Nickel Samurai (Engarde), but if the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) recorded the room during the murder and the footage (Video Tape 29) shows someone else, that would contradict. But since the Video Tape's contents are unknown unless asked, maybe another angle. 

Wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) states the time of death as 8:15 PM. The Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) mentions that the Nickel Samurai was supposed to have a post-ceremony stage show. If Engarde was at the stage show at the time, he couldn't be at the crime scene. But the testimony says he had to go to the stage show after the crime, implying he was there. However, if the stage show was at the same time as the murder, that's a contradiction. 

But how do we know the timing? The Spy Camera was set from 8 PM for 1 hour, capturing the murder at 8:15 PM. If the stage show was at 8 PM, Engarde would need to be there, making an alibi. The Press Conference Ticket's time isn't specified, though. Maybe the contradiction is between the testimony that Engarde was in the costume committing the murder (stabbing) and the Autopsy Report stating the cause was strangulation. But the testimony says "stabbing poor Juan," which the Crime Photo shows a knife in the chest. However, the autopsy says he was strangled first. So the actual cause was strangulation, but the testimony focuses on the stabbing. Does that contradict? Maybe not directly, because the stabbing still happened. 

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 15: the Knife with Engarde's fingerprints. But Testimony 4 says he wore the costume, which might have gloves, so fingerprints shouldn't be there. But the evidence says the knife has Engarde's prints. Wait, but if he was in the costume, maybe he took off the gloves? Not sure. That might be a possible contradiction. 

But the main contradiction I recall from the game is that the Spy Camera's footage would show that the killer was someone else (De Killer), but since the Video Tape's contents are not specified here, maybe the key contradiction is between the testimony that Engarde was the murderer (Nickel Samurai) and the Autopsy Report stating the cause was strangulation, not stabbing. But the testimony says he stabbed him, which is partially true. Hmm. 

Wait, in the actual game, the contradiction is between the Spy Camera footage (showing De Killer) and Oldbag's testimony. But in the given evidences, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) and the Video Tape (29) are present. However, without the Video Tape's content being explicit, maybe the key contradiction is between Testimony 4 (Engarde in costume stabbing) and the Autopsy Report (strangulation first). But the testimony doesn't mention the cause, just the act of stabbing. 

Alternatively, the Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) says the Nickel Samurai was to confess after the stage show. If the stage show was after the murder, maybe the timing is possible. But the key contradiction in the game is that the Spy Camera's footage shows the real killer, thus contradicting Oldbag's testimony. But in the provided data, the Spy Camera (21) is evidence, and the Video Tape (29) is from De Killer's hideout. But since the Video Tape's details are unknown unless asked, maybe the user expects the contradiction between Oldbag's testimony and the Spy Camera's existence. 

Alternatively, considering that the Spy Camera was recording the room during the murder, but Oldbag claims to have seen the Nickel Samurai there. If the camera was in the room, it would have captured the killer, which might not be Engarde. But without explicit mention of the footage, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (he wore the costume to go to the stage show after) and the Press Conference Ticket's timing. If the stage show was at the same time as the murder, Engarde couldn't be in two places. But the Press Conference Ticket's time isn't specified here. 

Alternatively, the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the testimony says he was in the costume, which might have gloves, leading to no fingerprints. But the evidence says the knife has his prints. That's a possible contradiction. However, the costume might not have gloves. The game might have that detail, but here it's not mentioned. 

Wait, in the game, the contradiction is that the Spy Camera's footage shows De Killer committing the murder, thus Oldbag's testimony is false. But here, the Video Tape (29) is mentioned as retrieved from De Killer's hideout, and the Spy Camera (21) was recording. So the existence of the Spy Camera (21) would contradict Oldbag's testimony if the camera's footage shows someone else. However, since the answer requires a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony, the best fit is Testimony 4 (Engarde stabbed him in the costume) vs. Autopsy Report (strangulation first). But the testimony doesn't claim that the stabbing was the cause of death, just that he did it. The autopsy confirms the stabbing happened, so no contradiction there. 

Wait, another angle: The Crime Photo (9) shows the victim was stabbed, but the Autopsy Report (14) says cause of death was strangulation. So the stabbing was post-mortem. Therefore, Testimony 4 says he was "stabbing poor Juan," implying that the stabbing killed him, but the autopsy says he was already dead from strangulation. So the testimony's assertion that the stabbing was the murder act contradicts the evidence that the cause was strangulation. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 14.

Yes, that's a solid contradiction. The testimony claims the stabbing was the murder, but the autopsy says he was strangled first, so the stabbing was after death. Thus, the actual cause of death is different from what the testimony implies.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 4 states that Matt Engarde wore the Nickel Samurai costume to stab Juan Corrida during the murder. However, Evidence 14 (Juan's Autopsy Report) indicates the cause of death was strangulation, followed by a stabbing. This contradicts the testimony's implication that the stabbing was the fatal act, as the victim was already dead from strangulation before being stabbed.
{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's dive into this. So, the task is to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. The user has provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. I need to compare them and find a pair where the evidence and testimony conflict.

First, let's look at the testimonies. Testimony 4 by Adrian Andrews says, "I felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice." Then she mentions in Testimony 5 that she knocked over the flower vase onto the guitar case.

Now, looking at the evidence related to the juice glass and the guitar case. Evidence 8 is the Wine Glass found next to the victim, filled with tomato juice, and it has Andrews' fingerprints. Evidence 7 is the Guitar Case, which has some water on the lid and only Corrida's fingerprints. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the guitar case on the floor next to the victim with a smashed vase, water stains, and the glass of juice on the dresser.

Wait, Testimony 4 says Andrews poured herself a glass of juice. The Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has her fingerprints, which would support her testimony. But in the Crime Photo, the glass is behind the victim on the dresser. If she poured the juice for herself, why is the glass there? Also, the glass in the photo is filled with tomato juice, which is the same as Evidence 8. However, the contradiction might not be here. Let's check other points.

Testimony 5: Andrews says she knocked over the vase onto the guitar case. The Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has water on the lid, which would come from the vase. However, the guitar case only has Corrida's fingerprints. If Andrews knocked over the vase, she would have touched the guitar case, right? But Evidence 7 says the case only has Corrida's prints. That's a contradiction. Andrews claims she caused the vase to fall onto the case, but her fingerprints aren't on the case. Therefore, her testimony conflicts with Evidence 7.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states, "I was the one who knocked the flower vase over, where it fell onto the guitar case." However, Evidence 7, which is the "Guitar Case," states that it "bears only Corrida's fingerprints," implying that Andrews should have left her prints if she interacted with the case as described.
{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair in JSON format at the end.

First, I need to look through the testimonies and cross-reference them with the evidence. Let me start by listing out the testimonies and then check each one against the evidence provided.

Looking at the testimonies, Testimony 1 from Adrian Andrews says: "I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over." Then Testimony 2 says, "It's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all." And Testimony 3: "As for why I opened the case... Even I don't know."

Now, checking the evidence. Evidence 7 is the Guitar Case, which is described as empty with Corrida's fingerprints. But wait, Evidence 7's description also mentions there's some water on top of the lid. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows a smashed vase with water on the carpet. If the vase was knocked over, that's where the water comes from. 

But the key point here is the Guitar Case's fingerprints. Andrews claims she opened it, but the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) only has Corrida's fingerprints. If she opened it, her fingerprints should be there, but the evidence states only the victim's. So Testimony 1 and 2 by Andrews say she opened the case, but the evidence shows her prints aren't on it. That's a contradiction.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (or 2) and Evidence 7. The user wants only one pair, so the correct JSON would be {"evidence": 7, "testimony": 1} or 2. Wait, Testimony 1 is about opening the case, which would require touching it. The evidence says only Corrida's prints are on it, so Testimony 1 contradicts Evidence 7.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 1}
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidence, and testimonies are all from a legal case scenario, probably from a game like Phoenix Wright. 

First, let's list out the key points from the evidences and testimonies. 

Looking at the testimonies by Adrian Andrews (Testimony 0 to 6). She claims that Matt Engarde is the murderer. In Testimony 4, she mentions that her thoughts were confirmed by the evidence: the button and the knife. Specifically, Testimony 5 says the button was torn off during a fight between Juan Corrida and Matt.

Now, checking the evidence. Evidence 14 (Juan's Autopsy Report) states the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife. However, the knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints and the button (Evidence 16) found in Engarde's hakama. But according to the autopsy, the actual cause of death was strangulation first, then the stabbing. So if the button and knife are presented as evidence of Matt's guilt, but the autopsy says the stabbing was after death, that's a contradiction. Because if the victim was already dead from strangulation, the stabbing wouldn't be the cause of death. Therefore, the presence of the knife with Engarde's prints might not be relevant to the actual murder method. But wait, the testimony says the button was torn off during the fight. If the fight led to strangulation, maybe the button is from that struggle. However, the main contradiction here is that the testimony points to the knife (which has Engarde's prints) as evidence, but the autopsy says the stabbing was post-mortem, meaning the killer used the knife after the victim was already dead. Therefore, the real cause of death is strangulation, so the knife isn't the murder weapon. Hence, Testimony 4's reference to the knife as confirming Matt's guilt contradicts Evidence 14's autopsy report which shows the stabbing wasn't the cause of death. Thus, the knife (Evidence 15) and Testimony 4 contradict each other because the knife's role as a murder weapon is invalidated by the autopsy.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 4 states that the button and knife confirm Matt's guilt, implying the knife was the murder weapon. However, Evidence 14 (Juan's Autopsy Report) states the cause of death was strangulation, with the stabbing occurring post-mortem. This means the knife was not the actual murder weapon, contradicting the testimony's assertion.
{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to go through all the provided characters, evidence, and testimonies to find a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony. The goal is to find one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

Starting with the characters, there's a range of individuals involved, including Maya Fey, Pearl Fey, Will Powers, Wendy Oldbag (Security Lady), Lotta Hart, Dick Gumshoe, Juan Corrida (victim), Matt Engarde, Adrian Andrews, Franziska von Karma, and others. The key here is to focus on the testimonies and cross-reference them with the evidence.

Looking at the testimonies, they're all from Adrian Andrews (Testimony 0 to 5). Let's go through each testimony and see if any of them clash with the evidence listed.

Testimony 4: "To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice." Andrews claims she poured juice for the victim when she thought he was just unconscious. However, looking at Evidence 8: Wine Glass. It's described as filled with tomato juice, not poured for the victim. Wait, no—Evidence 8 states that the wine glass was found next to the victim, filled with tomato juice, and it has Andrews' fingerprints. The testimony says she poured juice for him, which would align with her fingerprints being on the glass. Hmm, maybe not a contradiction here.

Testimony 5: "When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over." In the Crime Photo (Evidence 9), there's a smashed vase on the floor next to the guitar case. The description mentions the remains of a smashed vase that stained the carpet with water. Andrews says she knocked over the vase when she realized he was dead. But the Crime Photo shows the guitar case and the vase. However, Evidence 7: Guitar Case is empty with water only on the lid, and the vase is smashed with water on the carpet. The water on the guitar case's lid might be from the vase. If Andrews knocked over the vase when she discovered the body, that's consistent. But maybe another angle.

Looking at Juan's Autopsy Report (Evidence 14): The cause of death is strangulation with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife. The Crime Photo shows a knife in his chest. However, Testimony 4 and 5 don't directly contradict that. The knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. The contradiction might not be here.

Wait, Testimony 5 says Andrews knocked over the vase when she realized he was dead. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the guitar case is open and empty. The Guitar Case (Evidence 7) is empty with water only on the lid, and the vase is smashed. But according to Testimony 5, the vase was knocked over when she realized he was dead. However, if the vase was already smashed when the murder occurred, perhaps that's a contradiction. Wait, but the autopsy report says time of death was 8:15 PM. The Crime Photo's description mentions the open guitar case, the glass of juice, and the smashed vase. The order of events: If Andrews arrived after the murder, she poured juice (Testimony 4), then knocked over the vase (Testimony 5). The vase being smashed would be from her action, but the water on the guitar case's lid might be from the vase. However, the Crime Photo's description says the guitar case is next to the remains of the smashed vase. If the vase was broken when she arrived, then her knocking it over would have caused that. Wait, no—she says she knocked it over when she realized he was dead. So the vase was intact before she arrived. But in the Crime Photo, it's already smashed. That would mean the vase was smashed during the murder, which contradicts her testimony that she knocked it over upon discovering the body. However, the Crime Photo is a photo of the murder scene, which includes the smashed vase. If the murder occurred at 8:15 PM, and Andrews arrived later, then the vase was already smashed, contradicting her claim that she knocked it over upon discovering the body. Therefore, Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) shows the vase already smashed, but Testimony 5 claims she knocked it over when she found the body. That would be a contradiction. But wait, the Crime Photo's description says "the remains of a smashed vase that has stained the carpet with water." If Andrews knocked it over, that would be after the murder, but the Crime Photo is taken after the murder. So if the vase was smashed during the murder, then Andrews' testimony about knocking it over when she found the body would be a contradiction because the vase was already smashed. Alternatively, maybe the vase was broken in two incidents. But the Crime Photo shows the aftermath of the murder scene, so if the vase was already broken before Andrews arrived, her testimony is false.

Thus, Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) showing the smashed vase contradicts Testimony 5 where Andrews claims she knocked over the vase upon realizing the victim was dead. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 9 and Testimony 5. But let's check other possibilities.

Another angle: The Autopsy Report (14) says cause of death was strangulation followed by stabbing. The Knife (15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but Testimony 5 is about the vase. Alternatively, Testimony 0: "That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself." Evidence 8 says the wine glass has Andrews' fingerprints and was found next to the victim. If she poured the juice for him, then her fingerprints would be on it, which aligns. No contradiction there.

Wait, Testimony 4 says she poured him juice when she thought he was unconscious. The glass is there, so that's consistent. The contradiction I initially thought between the vase in the Crime Photo and Testimony 5 seems valid. However, in the scenario, if the Crime Photo shows the vase already smashed, but Andrews says she knocked it over when she found the body, which would be after the murder, then the photo should include the smashed vase from her action. But the photo is taken at the crime scene, which would include any post-murder actions. However, if the vase was broken during the murder, then her testimony would be a lie because she's claiming to have broken it upon discovery, but it was already broken. Alternatively, maybe the vase was intact before the murder, broken during the struggle, and then Andrews broke it again? That seems unlikely. Therefore, the contradiction is that the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the smashed vase, which would have been there before Andrews arrived, contradicting her testimony that she knocked it over when she found the body. Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 9 and Testimony 5. But wait, the answer format requires one pair. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the Autopsy Report (14) states the cause of death as strangulation and stabbing, but the Crime Photo (9) shows the knife in the chest. If a testimony claims he was shot, but no—Testimony 5 is about the vase. Wait, another angle: Testimony 5 says she knocked over the vase when she realized he was dead, which would have caused water to spill. The Guitar Case (7) has water only on the lid. The Crime Photo (9) mentions the smashed vase staining the carpet with water. If Andrews knocked over the vase, that would explain the water on the carpet. However, the Guitar Case's water on the lid might be from the vase's water spilling. But the timing: if the murder happened at 8:15 PM, and Andrews arrived later, then the vase was smashed by her, leading to water on the carpet and the guitar case's lid. The Crime Photo would capture that. So maybe there's no contradiction here. Hmm.

Wait, maybe looking at Testimony 4: she poured juice for him. The Wine Glass (8) has tomato juice and her fingerprints. But the Autopsy Report (14) says he was strangled and stabbed. If he was already dead when she poured the juice, that's possible, but the glass being there isn't a contradiction. Maybe another testimony: Testimony 3: "When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind." If the victim was strangled and stabbed, maybe his appearance would show signs of violence, but the testimony says he looked slumped and tired. The autopsy mentions strangulation, which might leave marks, but if he was sitting slumped, maybe that's plausible.

Alternatively, consider the Jammin' Ninja's Button (16) found in Engarde's hakama. If a testimony claims someone else was the killer, but the testimonies here are from Andrews, not directly addressing that.

Looking back, the initial thought about the vase might not hold because the Crime Photo could have been taken after Andrews knocked over the vase. Therefore, the smashed vase in the photo would be consistent with her testimony. So maybe that's not a contradiction.

Another possible contradiction: The Autopsy Report (14) states the victim was strangled first, then stabbed. The Crime Photo (9) shows a knife sticking out of his chest. The Knife (15) has Engarde's fingerprints. However, Testimony 5 is about the vase. Not directly related.

Wait, Testimony 4 says she poured juice for him when she thought he was unconscious. The Wine Glass (8) is filled with tomato juice and has her prints. If the victim was already dead, pouring juice wouldn't be possible if he was dead. But the cause of death was strangulation and stabbing, so if he was dead when she poured the juice, that's possible. No contradiction there.

Another angle: The Magazine Clipping (11) talks about a love scandal between Juan Corrida and Adrian Andrews. The Suicide Note (27) of Celeste Inpax mentions Engarde's misdeeds. Maybe a testimony contradicts this, but the testimonies here are from Andrews about her actions, not about relationships.

Wait, looking at Testimony 0: "That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself." Evidence 8 shows her fingerprints are on the glass, which she admits to pouring for the victim. No contradiction.

Wait, the Guitar Case (7) has water only on the lid, and the vase was smashed, staining the carpet. Testimony 5 says she knocked over the vase when she realized he was dead. If the water on the guitar case's lid is from the vase, then the timing would be after the murder. But the Crime Photo includes the smashed vase, which would be consistent with her action. So no contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: The Spy Camera (21) was set to record the victim's room from 8 PM for 1 hour. The murder happened at 8:15 PM. The Video Tape (29) from De Killer's hideout might have footage. If the testimony claims something that contradicts the spy camera footage, but the testimonies don't mention that. Alternatively, the Crime Photo (17) taken by Lotta shows a person in samurai garb outside the door. If a testimony claims someone was elsewhere, but the testimonies here are from Andrews.

Wait, Testimony 2: "And Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner." The Autopsy Report (14) says he was strangled and stabbed. If he was sitting slumped, maybe the position aligns. No contradiction.

Wait, maybe the Autopsy Report (14) says time of death 8:15 PM, but the Spy Camera (21) was recording from 8 PM. If the footage shows the murder happening at a different time, but there's no testimony about the time. The testimonies don't mention the time of their arrival.

Alternatively, looking at the Knife (15) with Engarde's prints, but the actual cause of death was strangulation first. So the knife was used post-mortem. If a testimony claims the stabbing was the cause, but the autopsy says strangulation. However, the testimonies from Andrews don't mention the cause of death, just her actions.

Wait, Testimony 4: she poured juice for him thinking he was unconscious. If he was already dead, that's possible. No contradiction.

Another angle: The Pistol (28) retrieved from De Killer's hideout. Testimony 5 doesn't mention a pistol. The testimonies here don't involve firearms.

Back to the original thought about the vase. If the Crime Photo (9) shows the smashed vase and the Guitar Case (7) with water on the lid, and Testimony 5 says Andrews knocked over the vase when she found the body, then the water on the guitar case's lid would be from the vase. But if the vase was smashed during the murder, then the water would have been there before Andrews arrived, making her testimony false. But if the vase was intact before the murder and she knocked it over upon arrival, then the smashed vase in the Crime Photo would be from her action, which is possible. Therefore, no contradiction. So maybe that's not the issue.

Wait, the Guitar Case (7) is described as having water only on the lid. The smashed vase's water is on the carpet. If Andrews knocked over the vase, the water would spill onto the carpet and possibly the guitar case. The Crime Photo shows both the smashed vase and the guitar case. So if she knocked it over, that's consistent. Therefore, no contradiction here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let's look at the Autopsy Report (14) again. The cause of death is strangulation followed by a stabbing. The Knife (15) has Engarde's fingerprints. If the stabbing was post-mortem, then the actual cause of death was strangulation. But how does that relate to the testimonies? The testimonies from Andrews don't mention the cause of death, just her actions.

Wait, maybe the Wine Glass (8) has tomato juice, but if the victim was already dead when she poured it, that's possible. No contradiction.

Another possibility: The Magazine Clipping (11) suggests a relationship between Corrida and Andrews. The Suicide Report (12) of Celeste Inpax, found by Corrida, and the Attempted Suicide Report (13) of Andrews. The Figurine (25) contains Celeste's Suicide Note (27), which implicates Engarde. But testimonies don't directly address this.

Wait, Testimony 0: "That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself." She implies she poured it for the victim. But if the victim was already dead, pouring juice for him is odd but not impossible. No contradiction with evidence.

Maybe I need to look for a more direct contradiction. For example, Evidence 14 (Autopsy Report) says death by strangulation and stabbing, but a testimony claims something else. However, none of the testimonies here address the cause of death.

Wait, Testimony 4 says she thought he had fainted, so she poured him juice. If he was strangled, there might be visible marks on his neck. If she didn't notice that, maybe that's a discrepancy, but it's not a direct contradiction with evidence.

Another angle: The Spy Camera (21) was recording the room during the murder. If the Video Tape (29) shows someone else, but the testimonies don't mention that. However, the user hasn't provided the video's contents, so we can't use that.

Alternatively, the Jammin' Ninja's Button (16) found in Engarde's hakama links him to the crime. Testimony 2 from Stickler in a previous case isn't here.

Wait, this is taking too long. Let me recap: The task is to find one pair where evidence contradicts testimony. The user's previous examples involved direct contradictions, like a testimony claiming not to touch the murder weapon vs. evidence showing fingerprints.

Looking at the current case, perhaps Testimony 4: Andrews says she poured juice for the victim when she thought he was unconscious. However, the Autopsy Report (14) states the time of death was 8:15 PM. If Andrews poured the juice after that, the glass (Evidence 8) would have her prints, which is consistent. No contradiction.

Wait, the Wine Glass (8) is filled with tomato juice, and the Crime Photo (9) shows a glass of juice behind the victim. The testimony says she poured it for him, which matches. No issue.

Wait, maybe the Knife (15) has Engarde's prints, but the Autopsy Report says the victim was strangled first. So the knife was used after death. If a testimony claimed the stabbing was the cause, but Andrews' testimonies don't address that.

Perhaps another angle: The Guitar Case (7) is empty with water on the lid. The Crime Photo (9) shows it open next to the victim. If the Guitar Case was supposed to contain something, but it's empty. However, no testimony mentions that.

Wait, the Radio Transceiver (4) is from De Killer. Testimonies don't mention this.

Alternatively, the Figurine (25) has thin cuts and is a puzzle. Celeste's Suicide Note (27) is inside, which is related to Engarde. But testimonies don't refer to this.

I might be missing the key contradiction. Let's look again.

Ah! Testimony 5: "When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over." The Crime Photo (9) shows the smashed vase, which would have been captured in the photo. However, the Spy Camera (21) was recording the room from 8 PM for 1 hour, which would include the time of death at 8:15 PM. If the Spy Camera footage shows the vase being smashed at a different time than when Andrews claims she did it, that would be a contradiction. But without the footage details, we can't say. However, the Spy Camera (21) and Transmitter (22) are part of the evidence, but there's no testimony about the camera's footage.

Wait, the Spy Camera is in the Stuffed Bear (23), which was bought by Engarde (Evidence 24). The Video Tape (29) is from De Killer's hideout, but we don't know its contents. However, the Spy Camera was running during the murder. If the footage shows Andrews knocking over the vase after the murder, that would align. If it shows the vase already smashed before she arrived, that would contradict her testimony. But since we don't have the footage details, maybe this isn't the contradiction.

Another angle: The Guitar Case (7) has water only on the lid, but the vase's water is on the carpet. If Andrews knocked over the vase, the water would be on the carpet and possibly the guitar case. The Crime Photo shows both, which matches her testimony. No contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between the Autopsy Report (14) stating the victim was strangled first, and the Knife (15) with Engarde's prints. But the testimonies don't mention the order of the attacks.

I'm struggling to find a contradiction here. Maybe I missed something. Let me check the evidence and testimonies again.

Testimony 5: Adrian Andrews knocked over the vase when she realized he was dead. Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) shows the smashed vase. The description of the Crime Photo says the vase is smashed and the carpet is stained with water. The Guitar Case (7) has water on the lid. If Andrews knocked over the vase after the murder, the water would be there, which is consistent. But if the vase was already smashed before she arrived, that contradicts her testimony. How can we know when the vase was smashed?

The Autopsy Report says the time of death was 8:15 PM. The Spy Camera was recording from 8 PM. If the Spy Camera footage shows the vase being intact at 8:15 PM and then later smashed by Andrews, that's consistent. However, without the footage, we can't confirm. But according to the evidence list, the Spy Camera was running at the time of the murder. So if the murder occurred at 8:15 PM, and Andrews arrived later, the footage might show the vase being smashed after 8:15 PM. However, the user hasn't provided the footage's content, so we can't use that.

Wait, the Crime Photo (9) is described as showing the victim with a knife in his chest, the glass, the guitar case, and the smashed vase. The photo is taken at the crime scene after the murder. If Andrews arrived after the murder and smashed the vase, the photo would include that. So there's no contradiction here. Her testimony and the evidence align.

Hmm, perhaps I need to look elsewhere. Let's consider the Magazine Clipping (11) which implies a relationship between Corrida and Andrews. The Autograph (10) is to "Wendy" (Security Lady), suggesting a possible connection. But how does this relate to the testimonies?

Alternatively, the Wine Glass (8) has Andrews' fingerprints and tomato juice. If she poured it for the victim, that's consistent. No contradiction.

Wait, the Wine Glass (8) is described as "No sign it's been drank." Andrews says she poured it for him, but since he was dead, he couldn't drink it. That aligns. No contradiction.

Another angle: The Attempted Suicide Report (13) says Andrews attempted suicide due to Celeste's death. The Magazine Clipping (11) implies she was in a relationship with Corrida, which might be a motive. But again, not directly contradicting testimonies.

Wait, Testimony 1: "I was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state." The Crime Photo (9) shows the messy room. No contradiction.

Testimony 2: "And Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner." The Autopsy Report (14) says he was strangled and stabbed, which could leave him slumped. No contradiction.

Testimony 3: "When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind." This is plausible if he looked like he was sleeping.

I'm stuck. Let's try to find a contradiction based on the previous examples. In the previous question, the contradiction was between the autopsy report's injury location and the testimony's description of the shooting. Similarly, here, maybe the autopsy report's cause of death contradicts a testimony's account of events.

The Autopsy Report (14) states the victim was strangled with a scarf and then stabbed. The Knife (15) has Engarde's prints. However, the testimonies from Andrews don't mention the scarf or the stabbing. But Testimony 3: she didn't think he was dead, which makes sense if the strangulation marks weren't visible, but the stabbing wound would be. However, if the knife was already in his chest when she arrived, she would have seen it. But in Testimony 4, she poured juice for him, implying he was sitting there with a knife in his chest. That doesn't make sense. Wait, this could be the contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 4: "So I went to pour him some juice." If the victim had a knife sticking out of his chest, as per the Crime Photo (9), then Andrews would have seen the knife and realized he was dead immediately. But her Testimony 3 and 4 suggest she thought he was just unconscious or fainted, implying she didn't notice the knife. That contradicts the Crime Photo showing the knife in his chest. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3/4 and the Crime Photo (9). However, the question asks for one pair. Let's check.

The Crime Photo (9) clearly shows the knife in his chest. Andrews' Testimony 4 says she poured juice for him because she thought he was unconscious. But seeing a knife in his chest would make it obvious he was dead. Therefore, her testimony contradicts the Crime Photo. Thus, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 9.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 4 states that Adrian Andrews poured juice for Juan Corrida thinking he was unconscious. However, Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) shows a knife sticking out of the victim's chest, which would be immediately visible, making it unlikely she would mistake him for merely unconscious. This contradiction arises between the visible knife in the crime scene photo and her claim of not realizing he was dead.

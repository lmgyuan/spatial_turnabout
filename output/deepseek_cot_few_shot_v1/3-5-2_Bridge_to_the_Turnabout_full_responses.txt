Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to carefully go through all the characters, evidences, and testimonies provided to find contradictions.

Looking at the characters, there are a lot, but the key ones might be those involved in the testimonies. The testimonies in question are all given by Bikini. Let me check each of her statements against the evidence.

Starting with the evidences, let's list them out to see which ones might conflict with Bikini's testimonies. Evidence 12 is "Iris's Testimony" which states she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and stayed in her room until the murder was discovered. Testimony 3 from Bikini says, "Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner." But according to Iris's own testimony (Evidence 12), she was in her room after 10 PM. If Bikini claims Iris was at the Inner Temple after 10 PM, that directly contradicts Iris's testimony. 

Wait, but Evidence 12 is Iris's Testimony, which is a written statement, not necessarily a testimony given during the trial. However, in the context of the game, testimonies are usually given in court. So if Bikini testifies that Iris was at the Inner Temple after 10 PM, but Iris's own testimony says she was in her room, that's a contradiction. 

Another possible contradiction: Testimony 5 from Bikini says, "It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!" What did she see? The crime perhaps? But the murder happened around 10-11 PM according to the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11). The Weather Data (Evidence 7) mentions lightning at 10:45 PM. If Bikini's testimony about the timing conflicts with the lightning strike or the time of death, but I don't see a direct link here.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3 again: Bikini says Iris came to the Inner Temple dressed as she was at dinner. But if Iris was supposed to be in her room (Evidence 12), then that's a contradiction. So Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) contradicts Testimony 3 from Bikini. But Evidence 12 is labeled as Iris's Testimony, which is a document, so maybe that's the evidence contradicting the testimony. 

Yes, that seems to be the case. The evidence (Iris's Testimony) states she was in her room, but Bikini's Testimony 3 claims she was at the Inner Temple. So the pair would be Evidence 12 and Testimony 3. But the question asks for evidence and testimony that contradict each other, so the evidence here is 12, and the testimony is 3.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 3 states that "Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner." However, Evidence 12, "Iris's Testimony," asserts that she "rang lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered." This directly contradicts Bikini's claim that Iris was at the Inner Temple after 10 PM.
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3}
Alright, let's try to figure this out. I need to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. Let's start by looking at the testimonies and then check the evidences.

First, the testimonies are from Bikini. Testimony 5 says, "The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window." So according to Bikini, the victim was stabbed after being pushed out the window. 

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 11 is the autopsy report for Elise. It states the cause of death was loss of blood from a stab in the back, and that the body fell 10 feet after death. So the autopsy says she was stabbed first, then fell. But Bikini's testimony says she was pushed out the window first, then stabbed. That's a contradiction. Because the autopsy indicates the stab caused death before the fall, whereas Bikini claims the stab happened after the fall. So the evidence (11) contradicts testimony (5).

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states, "The stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window." However, Evidence 11, "Elise's Autopsy Report," states that the victim "fell 10 ft. after death" due to a stab wound in the back. This implies the stabbing occurred first, causing death before the fall, contradicting Bikini's claim that the stabbing happened post-fall.
{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. First, I need to go through the testimonies and see what each one claims, then check the evidence to find any inconsistencies.

Looking at the Testimonies, Testimony 5 by Bikini says: "And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!" So according to this, Elise was stabbed in the back. Now, checking the Evidences, Evidence 11 is Elise's Autopsy Report which states the cause of death as "loss of blood from stab in back." Wait, that actually matches. So that's not a contradiction. Hmm.

Wait, maybe another testimony? Let's check Testimony 2: "I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out." But if the stab was in the back, then maybe the position of the body or the weapon. Let me check the murder weapon. Evidence 10 is the Shichishito, which is a seven-branched sword. The autopsy says the stab was in the back. But wait, the Shichishito is noted as "Had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon." So the real murder weapon isn't the Shichishito. Then maybe another weapon? Let's look at Evidence 9: Victim's Staff. It mentions there's a sword hidden inside, but the staff's crystal sphere is missing. Evidence 16 is the Crystal Sphere found near Dusky Bridge with blood. The staff's description says it had no crystal sphere. If the staff had a hidden sword, maybe the actual murder weapon was that sword. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Wait, Testimony 5 says Elise was stabbed through the back. The autopsy confirms that. So maybe another point. Let's check Testimony 0: "When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place." If the sword (Shichishito) was already there, but the autopsy says the cause was a stab in the back, which could be from the hidden sword in the staff. But the Shichishito is not the murder weapon, so maybe Testimony 0 is referring to the Shichishito being there, but it's not the actual weapon. That might not be a direct contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 2 says the blade was plunged in to the hilt and drawn out smoothly. If the murder weapon was the hidden sword in the staff, which is a different weapon than the Shichishito, then maybe Testimony 2's description of the blade matches the hidden sword. But I'm not sure. Let me check the timing. The autopsy says time of death between 10-11 PM. The weather data (Evidence 7) mentions snow until 10:50 PM and lightning until 11 PM. The bridge was struck at 10:45 PM. The body fell 10 ft after death. The Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was found near the bridge with blood. Maybe the contradiction is about the time or the location.

Wait, looking at Testimony 5 again: Bikini says she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise through the back when she awoke. But the autopsy says the cause was a stab in the back. So that matches. Maybe another angle. Let's check the Shichishito (Evidence 10) again. It's stated that it's not the murder weapon despite having the victim's blood. So if Bikini's testimony refers to the Shichishito being the weapon, but the evidence says it's not, that would be a contradiction. But Testimony 5 talks about stabbing with a blade, which could be the hidden sword. Alternatively, maybe Testimony 2's description of the blade being plunged in contradicts the actual murder weapon. Hmm.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 claims the stabbing was through the back, which the autopsy supports. But maybe the position of the body. The autopsy also mentions the body fell 10 ft after death. How does that tie in? Maybe the location of the body after falling? Let's check the Crime Photo (Evidence 13) and Tracks Photo (Evidence 14). The tracks photo shows tracks leading to Dusky Bridge. The Crystal Sphere was found near the bridge. If the murder happened elsewhere and the body fell, maybe that contradicts the testimony's location. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's focus on the murder weapon. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) is not the murder weapon, but it's at the scene with the victim's blood. The real weapon might be the hidden sword in the staff (Evidence 9). If Bikini's testimony says she saw the stabbing with the Shichishito, that would contradict Evidence 10. But Testimony 5 says "stabbing Mystic Elise through the back" without specifying the weapon. However, Testimony 2 talks about the blade being plunged in, which could refer to the hidden sword. Alternatively, Testimony 0 says the sword (Shichishito) was already in place. If the Shichishito was already there, but the real murder was committed with the hidden sword, that's possible, but not a direct contradiction.

Wait another angle: The autopsy report (Evidence 11) states the time of death was between 10-11 PM. The weather data (Evidence 7) mentions lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. If the murder happened after the bridge was struck, but the body fell 10 ft, maybe the timeline is conflicting. But the testimonies don't mention the time directly. Alternatively, Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. If the murder happened after 10 PM, that might not contradict unless someone's alibi is involved. But the question is about evidence and testimony contradicting.

Wait, Testimony 5 says Bikini saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise, but the autopsy says the stab was in the back. If Bikini saw the stabbing from the front, but the wound is in the back, that would be a contradiction. Wait no, Testimony 5 says "stabbing through the back," which matches the autopsy. So that's not it. Let me check again.

Another possibility: The autopsy says the victim was stabbed in the back, but the murder weapon (Shichishito) is a seven-branched sword, which might not be a typical stabbing weapon. But the Shichishito isn't the real murder weapon. The real weapon is the hidden sword in the staff. So Testimony 2's description of the blade being plunged in might align with the hidden sword. If Testimony 2 refers to the Shichishito, that's a problem because it's not the real weapon. But the testimony doesn't specify which blade. Alternatively, Testimony 0 says the sword (Shichishito) was already in place, but if the real murder happened with the hidden sword, then maybe Testimony 0 is incorrect. However, the question is about a direct contradiction between a testimony and evidence.

Wait, Testimony 5 says Bikini saw the stabbing in the back. The autopsy supports that. The contradiction must be elsewhere. Let's check the other evidences. Evidence 16 is the Crystal Sphere with blood, which came from the victim's staff. The staff (Evidence 9) had no crystal sphere, so it was missing. If the murder involved the staff's hidden sword, and the crystal sphere was found near the bridge, perhaps the timeline or location contradicts a testimony. But how?

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says Bikini saw the stabbing when she awoke, but according to the autopsy, the body fell 10 ft after death. If the stabbing happened in one location and the body was moved, but Bikini's testimony places the stabbing elsewhere. However, the evidence doesn't directly state the location of the stabbing versus where the body was found. The crime photo (Evidence 13) shows the courtyard where the murder occurred. The Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows tracks leading to Dusky Bridge. Maybe the body was moved from the bridge to the courtyard, but I'm not sure.

Wait, Evidence 11 says the body fell 10 ft after death. If the murder happened in a place where a 10 ft fall is possible, like from a bridge, but the crime photo is the courtyard. The Dusky Bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM. The Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) found near the bridge with blood suggests the victim was there. Maybe the murder happened on the bridge, the body fell into the courtyard, but the crime photo shows the courtyard. However, Testimony 5 says Bikini saw the stabbing in the courtyard. If the body was found in the courtyard, but the actual murder happened on the bridge, that would contradict. But how does that relate to a specific testimony and evidence pair?

Alternatively, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) has blood and came from the staff. If the staff's crystal sphere was found near the bridge, but the murder happened in the courtyard (Crime Photo 13), that suggests the staff was used there, but the sphere ended up on the bridge. Maybe the timeline: the murder happened after the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM. The weather data says snow stopped around 10:50 PM. If the sphere was found half-covered in snow, that suggests it was placed there during the snowfall, before 10:50. But the murder's time of death is between 10-11 PM. If the sphere was part of the murder weapon used after 10:50, then the snow would have stopped, so the sphere wouldn't be half-covered. But this is getting too speculative.

Let me try to find a direct contradiction. The key is to match a testimony's statement with an evidence that directly contradicts it.

Looking at Testimony 2: "I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out." If the blade was the hidden sword in the staff (Evidence 9), which was missing its crystal sphere, but the sphere was found near the bridge (Evidence 16). If the staff's sword was used, then the crystal sphere would have been detached. But the testimony doesn't mention the crystal sphere. Not sure.

Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the cause was a stab in the back. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) is a seven-branched sword, which is jagged. If the wound was from a smooth blade, but the Shichishito is jagged, that could be a contradiction. But Evidence 10 says the Shichishito is not the murder weapon, so the real weapon (staff's sword) might have a smooth blade. The staff's hidden sword is described as a sword, which is typically smooth. So Testimony 2's description of a smooth draw might align with that. The contradiction isn't here.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 5 says Bikini saw the stabbing occur when she awoke, but the autopsy report says the body fell 10 ft after death. If the stabbing happened in a location where a 10 ft fall is possible, like from a height, but the testimony places the stabbing in a different location. For example, if Bikini was in the courtyard and saw the stabbing there, but the body was found 10 ft below (like from a bridge), then that's a contradiction. The Crime Photo (Evidence 13) shows the courtyard, implying the body was there. The autopsy says the body fell 10 ft after death. So maybe the murder happened elsewhere, like on the bridge, and the body fell to the courtyard. But Bikini's testimony says she saw it in the courtyard. That would contradict the evidence of the body falling 10 ft. But the testimony doesn't specify the location beyond "the scene." The Crime Photo is the courtyard, so maybe the body was found there. If the autopsy says the body fell 10 ft, perhaps from the bridge to the ground below, but the testimony says the stabbing was in the courtyard. That would be a contradiction. But how does that tie to specific evidence and testimony?

Alternatively, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) states the body fell 10 ft after death, implying the murder occurred at a height. If the Crime Photo (Evidence 13) shows the courtyard, which is ground level, then the murder must have happened elsewhere, like on the bridge. If Testimony 5 says Bikini saw the stabbing in the courtyard, that contradicts the evidence that the body fell 10 ft. So the testimony placing the stabbing in the courtyard (ground level) contradicts the autopsy's indication that the body fell 10 ft (from a height). Therefore, Testimony 5 and Evidence 11 contradict each other. But wait, the autopsy says "Body fell 10 ft. after death." So the murder occurred, then the body fell. If the murder happened on the bridge (10 ft high), then the body fell to the ground. But Bikini's testimony says she saw the stabbing in the courtyard (ground level), which would mean the body didn't fall from a height. Therefore, Testimony 5 contradicts Evidence 11 because the autopsy indicates the body fell from a height after death, but the testimony describes the stabbing happening at ground level where no fall would occur.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. I need to go through each testimony and check against the evidence provided.

First, looking at the testimonies by Bikini. Testimony 0 says she saw the murder at around 11 PM. Then, the other testimonies talk about tracks from a snowmobile, the time it takes to get to Dusky Bridge, and speculation about Iris using the snowmobile.

Now, checking the evidences. Evidence 7 is the Weather Data, which mentions that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. Also, the snow stopped around 10:50 PM. The autopsy report (Evidence 11) states the time of death was between 10 and 11 PM. 

Wait, Testimony 0 claims the murder was at 11 PM. But the weather data shows lightning struck at 10:45 PM. If the murder happened around 11 PM, that's after the snow stopped. But maybe there's a contradiction here. Let me check again.

Alternatively, Evidence 14 is the Tracks Photo, showing tracks leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. Bikini's Testimony 2 says she saw tracks indicating the snowmobile was used. But if the snow stopped at 10:50 PM, and the murder was at 11 PM, then the tracks would have been covered by snow if the snow was still falling. Wait, no, the snow stopped at 10:50, so after that, any tracks made would not be covered by new snow. Hmm, maybe that's not a contradiction.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 0 says Bikini saw the murder at 11 PM. But the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says time of death was between 10 and 11 PM. So the murder could have happened any time in that window. But Bikini's testimony says 11 PM specifically. Is there evidence that contradicts the exact time?

Looking at Evidence 7 again: The weather data mentions that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. Also, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was found near Dusky Bridge with blood on it, and it came from the victim's staff. The victim's staff (Evidence 9) had a crystal sphere missing. So if the murder happened after 10:45 PM, maybe the sphere was lost during the lightning strike. But how does that tie to the testimony?

Wait, Bikini's Testimony 0 says she saw the murder at 11 PM. But the weather data in Evidence 7 says the lightning (which struck the bridge at 10:45 PM) and the snow stopped at 10:50 PM. If the murder was at 11 PM, that's after the snow stopped. However, the autopsy report allows for the time of death up to 11 PM, so that's within the window. Maybe not a direct contradiction here.

Wait, maybe another angle. Testimony 3 says it takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge but less than 5 by snowmobile. If someone used the snowmobile after 10:50 PM (when the snow stopped), they could have made tracks. But the tracks photo (Evidence 14) shows tracks leading to the bridge. However, if the murder happened at 11 PM, and the snowmobile was used after the snow stopped, the tracks would be visible. Not sure if that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5, Bikini says Iris could have driven the snowmobile. But Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) states she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. If Iris was in her room, she couldn't have driven the snowmobile. But that's a testimony vs. another testimony (Iris's), but the question asks for evidence vs. testimony. Wait, Iris's Testimony is listed as Evidence 12. So Testimony 5 (Bikini's) says Iris could have done it, but Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she was in her room. So that's a testimony vs. evidence contradiction. But the question might be asking for which specific evidence and testimony from the list given. Let me check.

The testimonies here are all from Bikini, so Testimony 5 is Bikini's. The evidence is Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12). So if Bikini's Testimony 5 claims Iris could have done it, but Evidence 12 says Iris was in her room, then that's a contradiction. But the user's previous examples paired a testimony with an evidence that directly contradicts it. For example, in the first example, testimony said "I never touched the murder weapon," but evidence showed prints on it. So in this case, Testimony 5 (Bikini) suggests Iris used the snowmobile, but Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she was in her room. Therefore, that would be a contradiction. But the user's answer format requires pairing a testimony (from the testimonies list) with an evidence (from evidences list). So Testimony 5 vs. Evidence 12. But maybe another contradiction exists.

Wait, looking again at Testimony 0: Bikini says she saw the murder at around 11 PM. However, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) states the time of death was between 10 and 11 PM. So 11 PM is the upper limit, but Bikini's Testimony 0 places it exactly at 11 PM. But that's not necessarily a contradiction unless there's evidence that the murder couldn't have happened at 11 PM. For example, if the body fell 10 feet after death (per Evidence 11), maybe related to the bridge collapse from the lightning strike. The lightning struck at 10:45 PM, and the bridge collapsed. If the victim was killed at 11 PM, then after the bridge was struck. But the bridge was already damaged. Maybe the murder couldn't have occurred at 11 PM if the bridge was destroyed. Wait, Evidence 7 says the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. If the bridge was destroyed then, how could the murder happen there at 11 PM? Unless the murder was elsewhere. Let me check the crime location. Evidence 13 is the Crime Photo showing the courtyard where Elise was murdered. So the murder happened in the courtyard, not on the bridge. Therefore, the bridge collapsing at 10:45 PM might not affect the murder time. But the victim's body fell 10 feet after death. How does that tie in? Maybe the body was moved. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 0's time of 11 PM. The Weather Data (Evidence 7) mentions that the lightning was from 10 PM to 11 PM, but specifically, lightning struck the bridge at 10:45. The snow stopped at 10:50 PM. If Bikini claims to have seen the murder at 11 PM, but the snow had already stopped. The tracks (Evidence 14) show tracks leading to the bridge. If the snowmobile was used after the snow stopped, the tracks would remain. But I'm not sure if that's a contradiction.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 0 says Bikini saw the murder at 11 PM. But the victim's autopsy (Evidence 11) says the body fell 10 feet after death. If the murder happened in the courtyard (Crime Photo 13), how did the body fall 10 feet? Maybe pushed from a height. The bridge's collapse might be related. The Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was found near the bridge with blood. If the victim was killed in the courtyard, how did the crystal sphere get there? Maybe the murderer went to the bridge afterward. 

Alternatively, considering the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was part of the victim's staff (Evidence 9), which was missing the sphere. The sphere was found near Dusky Bridge. If the murder happened in the courtyard, the sphere must have been taken to the bridge. But the timing: if the murder was at 11 PM, after the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45, which caused the bridge to collapse. So if the sphere was taken to the bridge after 10:45, but the bridge was already damaged, maybe that's a problem. But how does that tie to Bikini's testimony?

Alternatively, Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15) might show something relevant, but without details, hard to say. 

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 0 (murder at 11 PM) and the autopsy report (Evidence 11) which says time of death is between 10-11 PM. But Bikini's testimony is within that window. So no contradiction there. However, if the bridge was struck at 10:45, and the murder happened at 11 PM, perhaps the bridge was impassable, making it impossible for someone to go there afterward. But the murder was in the courtyard, not the bridge. 

Alternatively, Testimony 2 (Bikini saw tracks indicating snowmobile use) and the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows tracks leading to the bridge. But if the snow stopped at 10:50, tracks made after that wouldn't be covered. But Bikini's Testimony 3 says it takes 5 minutes by snowmobile. If the murder was at 11 PM, someone could have used the snowmobile after 10:50 to go to the bridge. Not a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is in Testimony 0 claiming the murder was at 11 PM, but the victim's body was found with the staff missing the crystal sphere, which was found near the bridge that was struck by lightning at 10:45. If the murder happened at 11 PM, the crystal sphere must have been taken there after 10:45. But if the bridge was already damaged, maybe it's impossible. However, the sphere was found on an outcropping, so maybe the bridge's collapse didn't affect that spot. 

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 5: Bikini suggests Iris could have driven the snowmobile. But Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) states she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. So if Iris was in her room, she couldn't have driven the snowmobile. This would be a contradiction between Testimony 5 (Bikini's) and Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony). However, the question asks for one pair, and the user's previous answers paired a testimony with evidence. For example, in the first example, testimony 2 (Phoenix) vs. evidence 1 (prints on bottle). So in this case, Testimony 5 (Bikini) says Iris could have done it, but Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she was in her room. That's a contradiction. So the answer would be {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 5}. But let me check the evidence numbering again.

Evidences are listed from 0 to 21. Evidence 12 is "Iris's Testimony". Testimonies are 0 to 5, all by Bikini. So Testimony 5 is Bikini's fifth testimony, which says Iris could have driven the snowmobile. Evidence 12 is Iris's Testimony stating she was in her room. So yes, this is a contradiction. But in the previous examples, the contradiction was between a testimony and evidence directly (e.g., "I never touched the weapon" vs. evidence of fingerprints). Similarly here, Bikini's Testimony 5 suggests Iris used the snowmobile, but Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room. Therefore, {"evidence":12, "testimony":5}.

Alternatively, another possible contradiction: Testimony 0 says murder at 11 PM, but the Weather Data (Evidence 7) shows lightning struck the bridge at 10:45, and around 30 minutes passed between the fire starting and going out. Wait, the weather data says: "Lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45. Around 30 minutes passed between the fire starting and going out." So if the fire started at 10:45 and took 30 minutes to go out, it would have ended around 11:15 PM. But if the murder happened at 11 PM, during the fire, but the autopsy says time of death is between 10-11 PM. Hmm, that's a possible contradiction. Wait, the time of death is up to 11 PM, but the fire was ongoing until 11:15. If the murder was at 11 PM, which is within the time window, but perhaps the fire's timing conflicts. Not sure. 

Alternatively, the victim was stabbed in the back (Evidence 11: cause of death is stab in the back), but Testimony 4 (Bikini) says the bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, but that's from a different question. Wait, no, in this case, the testimonies are about stabbing. Wait, no, the current testimonies are all by Bikini, and the murder is a stabbing. So perhaps another angle. 

Alternatively, the victim's staff (Evidence 9) has a sword hidden inside, but the murder weapon is the Shichishito (Evidence 10), which had the victim's blood but is not the actual murder weapon. Wait, the Shichishito is the apparent murder weapon but isn't, and the real weapon is the dagger (Evidence 19)? Not sure. 

Hmm. Given the previous examples, the most direct contradiction seems to be between Bikini's Testimony 5 and Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12). Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence":12, "testimony":5}.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 5 states, "Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all..." However, Evidence 12, "Iris's Testimony," states she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered, contradicting the possibility of her driving the snowmobile.
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find a contradiction between one of the evidences and one of the testimonies here. Let me go through each testimony and check against the evidence.

First, looking at the testimonies by Butz (Testimony 0 to 6). Testimony 5 says he arrived at the bridge and Nick (Phoenix) showed up less than a minute later. But according to Evidence 7, the weather data mentions that the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. Also, the snow stopped around 10:50 PM. If the bridge was on fire due to the lightning strike at 10:45, then Butz's testimony about running into Nick around that time might conflict with other timings. 

Wait, but the key contradiction might be in Testimony 5 where Butz claims he arrived at the bridge and Nick came less than a minute later. However, Evidence 11 (Elise's Autopsy Report) states the time of death was between 10-11 PM. The bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45, which started a fire that lasted about 30 minutes. If the murder happened around the same time, maybe the timeline overlaps. But where's the direct contradiction?

Another angle: Testimony 0 says Butz went to the shack around 9 PM, so about 10:30 PM. Wait, the testimony says "I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM..." That seems confusing. Wait, maybe that's a typo. Wait, the testimony says he went to the shack at around 9, but the estimated time would be 10:30 PM. That doesn't add up. Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Let me check the exact testimony again.

Testimony 0: "I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM..." Wait, that's conflicting. If he went to the shack at 9 PM, how does that translate to 10:30 PM? Maybe there's a time confusion here. But according to Evidence 7, the snow was from 7 PM to 10:50 PM. The lightning was from 10 PM to 11 PM. So if Butz says he went to the shack at 9, which would be 9 PM, but the events related to the bridge happened after 10 PM. Maybe Testimony 0's timeline is conflicting with something else. Alternatively, maybe Testimony 5's claim about arriving at the bridge and Nick showing up quickly contradicts the fact that the bridge was on fire due to lightning at 10:45, which would make it impossible for Phoenix to be there if he was already hospitalized? Wait, Character 8 (Phoenix) is described as "fell from Dusky Bridge and is currently hospitalized." So Phoenix was injured and in the hospital. But Testimony 5 says Butz ran into Nick at the bridge. That's a contradiction. Wait, Phoenix is hospitalized, so he couldn't have been at the bridge. So Testimony 5 is claiming that Nick was there, but according to the character description, Phoenix is in the hospital. Therefore, Testimony 5 contradicts Phoenix's status. But does any evidence mention Phoenix's location? The evidence might not directly state that, but in the characters list, Phoenix is said to be hospitalized. However, the user's instruction is to find a contradiction between evidence and testimony, not character info. So need to check evidence.

Wait, Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) shows tracks leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If Phoenix was hospitalized, those tracks might not be his. But perhaps another contradiction. Let me check Testimony 5 again. Butz says he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. But Phoenix was hospitalized, so how could he be there? However, the evidence that directly contradicts this would be Phoenix's hospitalization. But the problem is whether that's part of evidence or character description. The user instructions say to use evidence and testimonies. The character description is separate. So maybe that's not considered here. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 2: Butz says he looked out the window and saw Dusky Bridge on fire. According to Evidence 7, the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM, causing a fire that lasted 30 minutes. But Testimony 5 says Butz arrived at the bridge and saw Nick soon after. If the bridge was on fire due to the lightning strike at 10:45, then how could Butz and Nick be there? Unless the fire started but was not fully engulfed yet. But maybe the bigger contradiction is between the time of death and the testimony. Elise's Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) says time of death was between 10-11 PM, cause was a stab in the back leading to blood loss, and the body fell 10 ft after death. The murder weapon was the Shichishito (Evidence 10), but it's stated that it's not the actual murder weapon. The real murder weapon might be the crystal sphere (Evidence 16), which was found with blood. 

Wait, another angle: Testimony 5 says Butz arrived at the bridge and met Nick. However, according to the weather data (Evidence 7), the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM, and the snow stopped around 10:50 PM. If the bridge was on fire due to lightning, then Butz arriving there would be after 10:45. However, if the autopsy report says the victim died between 10-11 PM, but the body fell 10 ft after death (maybe from the bridge?), which was struck by lightning at 10:45. So if the victim was killed around the time of the lightning strike, maybe the time frame is tight. But where's the direct contradiction between evidence and testimony?

Alternatively, Testimony 5 claims Butz arrived at the bridge and met Nick, but Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) shows only one set of tracks leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If Butz and Nick both went there, there should be two sets of tracks, but the photo shows only one. Therefore, Testimony 5 contradicts Evidence 14. But the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows one track leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If Butz and Nick both went there, there should be more tracks, but the photo only shows one. That could be a contradiction. So Testimony 5 (Butz and Nick at the bridge) vs Evidence 14 (only one track). So that would be the pair. Therefore, the answer is evidence 14 and testimony 5.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 5 states that Larry Butz arrived at Dusky Bridge and encountered Phoenix Wright there. However, Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) shows only one set of tracks leading to the bridge, implying only one person went there, contradicting the testimony that two people (Butz and Phoenix) were present.
{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to find a contradiction between one of the testimonies and the evidence provided. Let's go through each testimony and see which one conflicts with any evidence.

Looking at the characters, there's a lot, but maybe the key ones here are Larry Butz (Testimony 0-4) and the evidence related to the crime scene. 

Testimony 2 from Butz says he saw Iris flying with her white hood fluttering. Now, checking the evidence, Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which mentions that she received it before the lights out bell and wears it at all times. The hood is supposed to protect from evil spirits. However, the weather data in Evidence 7 mentions that there was snow until around 10:50 PM and lightning, including a strike on Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. The note also says that around 30 minutes passed between the fire starting and going out. 

Wait, Testimony 2 says Larry saw Iris flying with the hood fluttering. But according to the autopsy report (Evidence 11), the victim was stabbed in the back and died around 10-11 PM. Also, Evidence 16 is the Crystal Sphere from the victim's staff, found near Dusky Bridge with blood. The staff's photo (Evidence 5) shows Elise with a staff that has a crystal sphere, but Evidence 9 (Victim's Staff) says there's no crystal sphere attached, and Evidence 16 confirms it was found near the bridge. 

But how does this relate to Larry's testimony? Well, if Larry claims he saw Iris flying, but Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) states she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. So if Larry saw her flying outside, that contradicts her alibi. But wait, the question is about evidence contradicting testimony, not another testimony. 

Wait, Evidence 12 is Iris's Testimony, which is part of the evidence. So if Testimony 2 (Larry saying he saw Iris flying) contradicts Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony that she was in her room), then that's a possible contradiction. But the problem states to find a contradiction between evidence and testimony. 

But let me check again. The evidence list includes Iris's Testimony as Evidence 12, which says she was in her room from 10 PM. If Larry's Testimony 2 claims he saw her outside, that's a direct contradiction. So Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) contradicts Testimony 2 (Larry's claim). But the user wants the evidence and testimony numbers. So Evidence 12 contradicts Testimony 2. 

Wait, but wait. The user's previous examples had the evidence as a physical piece contradicting a testimony. Let me check if there's another contradiction. 

Looking at Testimony 1: Butz says he was sketching in front of the bridge. Evidence 14 is the Tracks Photo showing only one track leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If Larry was there, maybe his tracks would be in the snow. But the tracks photo only shows one set. If Larry was there, maybe there should be more tracks. However, the time of the tracks isn't specified. The snow stopped around 10:50, but the photo was taken that night. If Larry was sketching during the snow, his tracks might have been covered. Not sure if that's solid.

Another angle: Testimony 4 from Butz says "Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up." The flames refer to the fire mentioned in Evidence 7's weather data, which says the fire started and went out around 30 minutes. But the timing here—maybe the lightning strike at 10:45 caused the fire, and the fire lasted 30 minutes. If Larry saw the flames go out, that would be around 11:15 PM (since lightning at 10:45 + 30 mins). But the autopsy report says death was between 10-11 PM. So if the victim died before 11 PM, how could the fire last until after 11? Maybe that's a point, but the autopsy time is a range up to 11 PM. Not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 2: Larry says he saw Iris flying with the hood. But Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which she was wearing, but according to her own testimony (Evidence 12), she was in her room. So the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Larry's claim) and Evidence 12 (Iris's alibi). Therefore, the correct pair would be Evidence 12 and Testimony 2. But I need to confirm if Evidence 12 is considered valid here. Yes, Evidence 12 is named "Iris's Testimony" and states she was in her room. So if Larry's testimony claims she was outside, that's a direct contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 2}.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 2 states that Larry Butz saw Iris flying with her white hood fluttering. However, Evidence 12, "Iris's Testimony," states that Iris was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. This directly contradicts Larry's claim of seeing her outside during that time.
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 2}

Alright, let's dive into this problem. So, the task is to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies. The user has given a bunch of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to find a pair where the evidence and testimony don't line up.

First, I'll start by reviewing all the testimonies and cross-referencing them with the evidence provided. Let's look at each testimony one by one and see if any of them conflict with the evidence listed.

Looking at the testimonies from Cody Hackins (Testimony 0 to 8), he's talking about sneaking into the studio through the woods to watch a rehearsal, getting lost for 30 minutes, and then witnessing a confrontation between the Steel Samurai and a bad guy. Specifically, in Testimony 5, he says he saw the Steel Samurai when he came out by the studio. Then in Testimony 6, he mentions the bad guy appearing, and in Testimony 7, the Steel Samurai defeating him. Testimony 8 says he didn't have his camera with him at the time, which would have been the perfect moment for a photo.

Now, looking at the evidence, there's Evidence 15: Cody's Camera. The description says it's a new digital camera that Cody always carries, though he's still learning to use it. So, if he always carries it, why does Testimony 8 say he didn't have it with him? That seems contradictory. The camera is listed as evidence, implying it was present, but his testimony claims he didn't have it when he saw the fight. That's a conflict.

Wait, but I need to check the timestamps and other details. The murder happened on October 15th at 2:30 PM. The autopsy report (Evidence 3) states the time of death. Cody's testimony about being there that day and his camera being part of the evidence. If the camera is part of the evidence collected, then perhaps he did have it with him, contradicting his statement that he didn't. But the testimony says he didn't have it "at that time" when he saw the fight. However, Evidence 15 states he always carries it. So there's a contradiction here.

Another angle: Let's check other possible contradictions. For example, Testimony 2 says he went through the woods off the path to avoid the old lady (Security Lady). But maybe there's evidence about access. Evidence 11 is Mr. Monkey's Head, which blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. If Cody arrived at the studio after getting lost for 30 minutes, the timing might be an issue. If he came out by the studio after 30 minutes of being lost, that would be around 2:30 PM (assuming he started at 2:00 PM as per Evidence 5's photo time). But the path was blocked from 2:15 PM onwards. However, Testimony 2 says he went off the path through the woods, so maybe that's not conflicting because he avoided the blocked path.

Alternatively, Evidence 5 is Powers'(?) Photo, taken at the gate at 2:00 PM, showing Powers dragging one leg. Testimony 4 says Cody got lost for about 30 minutes. If he arrived at the studio around 2:30 PM, which is the time of death, but the murder happened then. But how does that contradict? Maybe the photo shows Powers at 2:00 PM, but the murder was at 2:30 PM. Not sure if that's a contradiction.

But the main contradiction I noticed earlier between Testimony 8 and Evidence 15. If Cody always carries the camera, but he says he didn't have it then, that's a direct contradiction. So the evidence (15) contradicts testimony (8).

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 8 states, "If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you." However, Evidence 15, "Cody's Camera," states that "Cody always carries it," implying he had the camera during the incident. This contradiction suggests Cody may be lying about not having his camera.
{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 8}
Okay, let's tackle this question. We need to find a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony. The user wants just one pair, so I'll have to go through each testimony and check against the evidence to see where they clash.

Looking at the characters first: Maya Fey, Edgeworth, Detective Gumshoe, Will Powers (the defendant), Security Lady, Jack Hammer (victim), and others. The evidence includes autopsy reports, photos, the murder weapon, etc. The testimonies are from Cody Hackins, who was at the studio.

Now, the testimonies from Cody (Testimonies 0 to 5) mostly talk about him trying to take a photo of the Steel Samurai during the incident. Testimony 3 says he missed the photo because the lens wouldn't open in time, and Testimony 5 says he took a few shots but erased them because it was too late. 

Looking at the evidence, Evidence 5 is Powers'(?) Photo, which is a photo taken at the gate on Oct 15 at 2:00 PM (Photo #2), showing Powers dragging one leg. Then there's Evidence 15: Cody's Camera, a digital camera that he always carries. Also, Evidence 11: Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. 

Wait, the murder happened at 2:30 PM (Evidence 3). So the photo in Evidence 5 is taken at 2:00 PM, showing Powers. But Cody's testimony says he tried to take a photo but missed because the lens didn't open. However, Evidence 5 is a photo that exists, taken at 2:00 PM. If Cody's camera was the one that took that photo, then his testimony about missing the shot might be contradicted. But the photo in Evidence 5 is from the gate, not the crime scene. Maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Another angle: Testimony 5 says Cody erased the photos because they were too late. But if Evidence 15 is his camera, and there's a photo (Evidence 5) that's timestamped at 2:00 PM, which is before the murder (2:30 PM), maybe that's not directly related. Wait, the murder weapon is the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6), which has a mended break. The autopsy says cause of death was a spear through the chest. 

Alternatively, the Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene. But the Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) blocked the path from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. So if Powers was seen heading to the scene after 2:15 PM, he couldn't have gotten through because the path was blocked. But the photo (Evidence 5) shows him at 2:00 PM dragging his leg. Maybe that's a contradiction between the Security Lady's testimony and the photo? Wait, but the testimonies given here are all from Cody. The Security Lady's testimony isn't listed here; the Testimonies 0-5 are all from Cody. So maybe we need to focus on Cody's testimonies versus the evidence.

Looking at Cody's Testimony 3: he missed the photo because the lens wouldn't open. Testimony 5: he took a few shots but erased them. But Evidence 15 is his camera. If the camera's photos were erased, but there's another photo (Evidence 5) taken at 2:00 PM, maybe that's a contradiction. Wait, Evidence 5 is a photo taken at 2:00 PM at the gate, showing Powers dragging his leg. If Cody was taking photos at the time of the incident (around 2:30 PM), but the camera's photos were erased, how does that relate? Maybe the timestamps don't match. Alternatively, if Cody's camera was used to take the photo in Evidence 5, but he claims he missed the shot, that's a contradiction. But the user might be thinking that Evidence 5 is the photo Cody took but says he erased. Wait, Evidence 5 is a photo taken at 2:00 PM, which is before the murder. But the murder happened at 2:30 PM. So Cody's testimony about taking photos during the event (which would be after 2:30 PM) but erasing them might not directly contradict. Alternatively, maybe Cody's camera has some photos that he claims he erased, but the existence of a photo (like Evidence 5) taken by him would contradict his statement. But Evidence 5 is not necessarily taken by Cody. The description says "Taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios. [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]". So who took that photo? If it's from Cody's camera (Evidence 15), then Cody's testimony that he erased the photos would conflict with the existence of this photo. But the Evidence 5 is labeled "Powers'(?) Photo", which might mean it's a photo of Powers, not necessarily taken by him. Alternatively, maybe the Security Lady's statement (not listed as a testimony here) would be contradicted by the photo. But the testimonies given are all from Cody. Hmm. Wait, the Security Lady's claim is in the characters but not in the testimonies. The testimonies here are only Cody's.

Another possible contradiction: The autopsy report (Evidence 3) says death was by a spear through the chest. The Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) is the murder weapon with a mended break. But in Testimony 1, Cody says "The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain." If the Steel Samurai is Will Powers, then maybe the spear was used by him. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the timing. Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. If the murder was at 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked, how did the killer get through? But that's more of a logical contradiction, not directly between evidence and testimony.

Wait, let's focus on Cody's Testimony 5: he says he took a few shots but erased them. However, if the camera (Evidence 15) still has photos, that would contradict. But the evidence doesn't state that the camera has photos, just that it's a new digital camera. Or maybe the existence of Evidence 5 (the photo taken at 2:00 PM) is from Cody's camera, which he claims he erased. But the description of Evidence 5 doesn't mention being from Cody's camera. It just says it's a photo taken at the gate. So unless it's implied that Cody took that photo, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the script (Evidence 10) or other evidence contradicts something else.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 3 (Cody) says he missed the photo because the lens wouldn't open, but Testimony 5 says he took a few shots but erased them. These two testimonies might conflict with each other, but the question asks for a contradiction between evidence and testimony. So perhaps the camera (Evidence 15) being a new digital camera that he's still learning to use might indicate that he could have taken photos even if he thought he didn't. But the problem is, the evidence doesn't explicitly state that the camera has photos, unless Evidence 5 is from his camera. If Evidence 5 is from his camera, then his testimony about erasing them would be a contradiction. But the user needs to match evidence and testimony. So if Evidence 5 is a photo that exists, but Cody says he erased his photos, then Evidence 5 would contradict Testimony 5. However, Evidence 5 is timestamped at 2:00 PM, which is before the murder at 2:30 PM. If Cody's photos were of the murder or the Steel Samurai during the event (after 2:30 PM), then the 2:00 PM photo isn't part of that. So maybe that's not the contradiction.

Alternatively, the autopsy report (Evidence 3) states the cause of death as a spear through the chest. The Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) is the murder weapon with a mended break. If the testimony from Cody says the Steel Samurai was escaping, implying the Samurai was present, but maybe the spear being broken and mended could relate. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene, but the path was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) from 2:15 PM. If Powers was seen heading there after 2:15 PM, he couldn't have gone through. But Powers'(?) Photo (Evidence 5) shows him at 2:00 PM, which is before the block. So maybe the Security Lady's testimony (not listed here) would contradict the photo. But in the given testimonies, only Cody's are listed, so that's not applicable here.

Hmm. Let's re-examine the testimonies and evidence again.

Testimony 1 (Cody): "The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain." So he's describing the show's events. Testimony 2: he tried to take a photo. Testimony 3: missed because the lens didn't open. Testimony 5: took a few shots but erased them. The camera (Evidence 15) is his. If the camera has a photo that he claims he erased, that's a contradiction. But the evidence list doesn't mention any photos in the camera. The only photo evidence is Evidence 5 (Powers'(?) Photo) and Evidence 17 (Five-Year-Old Photo). Unless the "Path to Glory" (Evidence 14) has photos, but it's about victory scenes.

Wait, Evidence 5's description says it's a photo taken at the gate at 2:00 PM, showing Powers dragging one leg. If the Security Lady's testimony (not listed here) says she saw him at the scene, but the path was blocked after 2:15, then the photo showing him at 2:00 PM at the gate might support his alibi. But again, the testimonies provided are only Cody's.

Alternatively, maybe the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) being mended with duct tape. If the murder weapon was the spear, and the shaft was mended, but the autopsy says the victim was stabbed with a spear, which would require the spear to be intact. But the break might indicate that the spear was broken before or during the attack. Not sure if that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, the Empty Bottle (Evidence 7) has Jack's fingerprints, indicating he took sleeping pills. The Steak Plate (Evidence 16) has traces of sleeping pills and a bone. Maybe that suggests someone drugged him. But how does that contradict testimonies? Not directly.

Wait, maybe Cody's Testimony 5 says he erased the photos, but if there's a photo (like Evidence 5) that wasn't erased, that's a contradiction. But Evidence 5's existence isn't linked to Cody's camera. Unless the photo in Evidence 5 is from Cody's camera. The description of Evidence 5 is "Taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios. [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]". If that's from Cody's camera (Evidence 15), then Cody's claim that he erased the photos (Testimony 5) would contradict the existence of this photo. But the evidence doesn't explicitly state that the photo is from his camera. However, since Cody is the one with the camera (Evidence 15), and he was present that day (Character 8), it's possible that the photo in Evidence 5 is from his camera. If so, then Testimony 5 (he erased the shots) would contradict the existence of Evidence 5. But the user needs to have the evidence and testimony numbers correct.

So, if Evidence 5 is a photo that exists, and Testimony 5 says he erased them, then they contradict. Thus, the pair would be Evidence 5 and Testimony 5. But the user's answer must be in JSON like {"evidence": x, "testimony": y}. Let me check again:

Testimony 5: "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em." Person: Cody.

If the photo in Evidence 5 was taken by Cody's camera and wasn't erased, then that's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 5 contradicts Testimony 5. So the answer would be {"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}.

Let's think step by step:
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states, "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em." However, Evidence 5, which is "Powers'(?) Photo," shows a photo taken at 2:00 PM on the day of the crime, which contradicts Cody's claim that he erased all photos he took.
{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}

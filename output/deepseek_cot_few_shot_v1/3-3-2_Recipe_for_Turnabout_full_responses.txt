Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts which testimony here. Let's start by going through the testimonies and the evidence one by one.

First, the testimonies are all from Detective Gumshoe. Testimony 4 says that when Maggey was searched, they found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison (Evidence 14 and 16). But Evidence 14 is the Victim's Lottery Ticket found on Maggey, and Evidence 16 is the Potassium Cyanide in her apron. However, looking at the evidence, Evidence 6 is a Small Bottle found in the kitchen with the victim's ear medicine and unidentified fingerprints. Wait, but Testimony 4 mentions the poison (Potassium Cyanide in Evidence 16) was found in her apron. So maybe that's not a contradiction here.

Wait, let me check Testimony 5: "And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene." But Evidence 6 is a Small Bottle found in the kitchen, which is the victim's ear medicine. The prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty. So if the victim had a prescription that was supposed to be in the bag, but the bottle is found in the kitchen, maybe that implies something was moved or missing. But Testimony 5 says nothing else was missing. But the prescription bag is empty, and the bottle is found in the kitchen. So perhaps the bottle was supposed to be in the bag, but it's found elsewhere, meaning something was missing from the scene. Therefore, Testimony 5's claim that nothing was missing is contradicted by Evidence 17 (the empty prescription bag) and Evidence 6 (the bottle being in the kitchen). So the contradiction would be between Testimony 5 and Evidence 6 and 17. But maybe specifically, the empty prescription bag (Evidence 17) shows that the bottle (Evidence 6) was missing from the bag, hence something was missing from the crime scene, contradicting Testimony 5. Therefore, Testimony 5 says nothing was missing, but Evidence 17 shows the prescription bag was empty, implying the bottle was taken out. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 17. Alternatively, the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) was found in the kitchen, not in the bag, which should have contained it. Therefore, the fact that the bottle is in the kitchen instead of the bag means something was moved or missing, contradicting Testimony 5. So the correct pair would be Testimony 5 and Evidence 17 or 6. Let me check the details again.

Evidence 17: Victim's Prescription Bag - empty. Evidence 6: Small Bottle (ear medicine) found in the kitchen. So the bottle should have been in the bag, but it's not, hence something is missing from the bag. Therefore, Testimony 5 says nothing was missing, but the bag is empty, indicating the bottle was missing from there. But the bottle is found in the kitchen, so maybe it's not missing, but moved. However, Testimony 5 says "nothing else missing from the crime scene." If the bottle was moved from the bag to the kitchen, it's still present at the scene, just not in the original place. So maybe that's not a contradiction. Wait, Testimony 5 says "nothing else missing," meaning all items are accounted for, but if the prescription bag was supposed to have the bottle, and it's empty, but the bottle is found elsewhere, then technically it's not missing, just moved. So maybe that's not the contradiction. Let me check other testimonies and evidence.

Testimony 0: Crime reported at 2:25 PM. The autopsy report (Evidence 10) says time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. That's consistent. Testimony 4: Found poison and lottery ticket on Maggey. Evidence 16 (poison in her apron) and 14 (lottery ticket) match. Testimony 5: "nothing else missing." Let's see if there's another contradiction. Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony says he broke the vase at his seat. But in the Crime Photo (Evidence 12), there's an intact vase on each table. Wait, that's a contradiction. If Victor broke the vase, but the photo shows intact vases, then that's a problem. But Testimony 18 is actually Evidence 18, which is Victor's Testimony. But the testimonies listed are only up to Testimony 5 from Gumshoe. Wait, the Testimonies section lists Testimony 0 to 5, all from Gumshoe. Then Evidence 18 is "Victor's Testimony" which is an evidence, not a testimony given by a character here. So perhaps the contradiction is between Evidence 12 (Crime Photo showing intact vases) and Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) where he says he broke the vase. But according to the problem, we're supposed to find a contradiction between a testimony (from the Testimonies list) and an evidence. So if Victor's Testimony is part of the evidence (as Evidence 18), then Testimony 5 (from Gumshoe) says "nothing else missing," but the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the vases are intact, while Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) says he broke one. Therefore, the photo contradicts Victor's statement, but that's evidence vs evidence. Alternatively, maybe Testimony 5 (Gumshoe) says nothing was missing, but the victim's prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty, implying the bottle was taken out. However, the bottle is found in the kitchen (Evidence 6), so it's not missing, just moved. So maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let me check Testimony 3: "But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly." The victim had no ID (Testimony 2), but they found his identity. Maybe via Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar with a meeting note) or other evidence. Not a contradiction. Testimony 1: Maggey passed out, which is possible. Now, Evidence 13: Coffee Cup with Maggey's and victim's prints, and the lip stain on the front. If the cup was used by the victim, but Maggey's prints are on it, that's expected if she served him. But the poison was in her apron. Wait, the autopsy says potassium cyanide, which is in the coffee cup (Evidence 13). The poison (Evidence 16) is found in her apron. So the presence of the poison in her apron and the cup having her prints could be consistent. But maybe if the cup's handle is on the right, implying a right-handed person, but if the lip stain is on the front, maybe the way it was held contradicts something. Not sure. Alternatively, Testimony 5 says nothing else was missing, but the victim's prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty, and the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is found in the kitchen. So if the bottle was supposed to be in the bag, then it's missing from there but present in the kitchen. Therefore, the bag is missing the bottle, which would contradict Testimony 5's statement that nothing was missing. However, the bottle is still at the scene, just in a different location. So perhaps that's not considered 'missing' but moved. Alternatively, maybe another contradiction: Testimony 5 says nothing else was missing, but Evidence 14 (lottery ticket) was found on Maggey, which was the victim's. So if the lottery ticket was taken from the victim, then it's missing from him but found on her. But Testimony 5 says "nothing else missing from the crime scene," meaning all items are accounted for, but the lottery ticket was moved from the victim to Maggey. However, moving items doesn't mean they're missing from the scene. So maybe that's not it. Let me think again. Another possibility: Testimony 5 says "nothing else missing," but the victim's prescription bag is empty. The Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is the victim's ear medicine, so it should have been in the bag. Since it's found in the kitchen, the bag is empty, meaning the bottle was taken out. So the bottle wasn't missing from the scene, just moved. Therefore, Testimony 5's claim that nothing was missing is correct, as the bottle is still present. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check Evidence 6 again. It says the Small Bottle is "found in the kitchen. Shape is different from the others bottles. Contents unknown. The victim's ear medicine. Found covered in unidentified fingerprints in the kitchen." So if the victim's prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty, and the bottle is in the kitchen, then the bottle was moved from the bag to the kitchen. Therefore, the bag is missing the bottle, but the bottle is still present in the crime scene. Therefore, Testimony 5 says nothing is missing, which is true because the bottle is still there. So maybe that's not a contradiction. What else? Let's look at Testimony 0: the crime was reported at 2:25 PM. Autopsy (Evidence 10) says time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. That's consistent. Testimony 4 says the poison and lottery ticket were found on Maggey. Evidence 16 (poison in her apron) and 14 (lottery ticket on her) match. Testimony 5: "nothing else missing." Wait, Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony stating he broke the vase. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows intact vases. So if Victor broke a vase, but the photo shows intact vases, that's a contradiction. But Testimony 5 is from Gumshoe, not Victor. The contradiction would be between Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) and the Crime Photo (Evidence 12). However, the question asks for a testimony (from the Testimonies list) and evidence contradiction. Since Victor's Testimony is an Evidence (18), not a Testimony from the list, the contradiction would be between Evidence 12 and Evidence 18. But the question requires a testimony from the Testimonies list (0-5) and an evidence. So perhaps another angle. Let me check Evidence 3: Sports Paper from Dec 3rd with a doodle. Testimony 0 says crime reported at 2:25 PM, which is after the estimated time of death. Not a contradiction. Maybe Testimony 5 and Evidence 12. If Testimony 5 says nothing was missing, but the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the victim's table with a knocked-over coffee cup and stained cloth, but the prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty. Wait, the prescription bag being empty isn't shown in the photo. The photo shows "some pieces of papers" near the coffee cup, which could be the lottery ticket or others. Alternatively, the vase being intact in the photo but Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) says he broke it. But since the photo is part of the evidence, and Victor's statement is also evidence, that's evidence vs evidence. The question asks for a testimony (from the list) and evidence. So looking back, maybe Testimony 5 (Gumshoe says nothing else missing) is contradicted by Evidence 17 (empty prescription bag), implying the bottle was missing. But the bottle is found in the kitchen (Evidence 6), so it's not missing. Therefore, the prescription bag is missing the bottle, but the bottle is present elsewhere. Therefore, nothing is missing from the crime scene as a whole. So maybe that's not a contradiction. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. Let's look for other possibilities. Testimony 4 says they found the lottery ticket and poison on Maggey. Evidence 14 (lottery ticket) and 16 (poison) confirm that. Testimony 5 says nothing else was missing. But Evidence 14 is a winning ticket for half a million, which the victim had. So if the victim had the ticket, and it's found on Maggey, then it was taken from him. But that's theft, not something missing from the scene. Since the ticket is still present in the scene (on Maggey), it's not missing. So no contradiction there. Wait, the victim's lottery ticket was found on Maggey, implying she took it. But that's part of the evidence against her. So Testimony 5's statement that nothing was missing is correct because the ticket is still there. What about the Poison (Evidence 16) in her apron? If the poison was brought by her, then it's not missing. So no contradiction. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 6. Evidence 6 is the Small Bottle (ear medicine) found in the kitchen with unidentified fingerprints. If the victim's prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty, then the bottle should have been in the bag. Since it's found in the kitchen, perhaps it was moved, but that doesn't mean it's missing. Therefore, Testimony 5's claim that nothing was missing is still true. I'm not finding a clear contradiction here. Wait, maybe another angle: the autopsy report (Evidence 10) says cause of death is potassium cyanide poisoning, which is in the coffee cup (Evidence 13). But the poison is found in Maggey's apron (Evidence 16). So the presence of the poison in her apron and the cup having her fingerprints would be consistent with her administering it. But that's not a contradiction. Alternatively, Testimony 5 says nothing was missing, but the prescription bag is empty. If the bottle was supposed to be in the bag but is in the kitchen, then the bag is missing its contents. However, the bottle is still at the scene, so technically not missing. Therefore, Testimony 5 is correct. Wait, perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 5 ("nothing else missing") and Evidence 17 (empty prescription bag). The bag is empty, so the medicine bottle is missing from the bag, but found elsewhere. So if the bag is part of the crime scene, then the bottle is missing from its original place (the bag) but present elsewhere. Therefore, the bag's contents are missing, which contradicts Testimony 5. So the answer would be Testimony 5 and Evidence 17. But let me check the numbers. Testimony 5 is index 5, and Evidence 17 is index 17. But wait, in the problem, the answer must be in the format {"evidence": X, "testimony": Y}. So according to this reasoning, Testimony 5 (Gumshoe's statement that nothing else was missing) contradicts Evidence 17 (the empty prescription bag), implying the bottle was missing from the bag. But the bottle is present in the kitchen (Evidence 6), so it's not missing from the scene. Therefore, the contradiction is that the bag is missing the bottle, but the bottle is present elsewhere. Therefore, the bag's contents are missing, but the item itself is not. So maybe this is a valid contradiction. Alternatively, the autopsy report says potassium cyanide, but the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is ear medicine, not poison. The poison is in Evidence 16. So no contradiction there. I think the correct answer is Testimony 5 (Gumshoe's "nothing else missing") is contradicted by Evidence 17 (empty prescription bag), because the bag is supposed to contain the medicine bottle, which is now in the kitchen. Therefore, the contents of the bag are missing, which contradicts the testimony that nothing was missing. Hence, the pair is evidence 17 and testimony 5.

{"evidence": 17, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to look through all the evidence and testimonies provided and find any contradictions between them. The goal is to find one pair where a testimony directly contradicts a piece of evidence.

Starting with the testimonies, let's go through them one by one. Testimony 0 from Kudo says, "The young man was reading the sports paper." That seems straightforward. Testimony 1 claims that the serving girl (Maggey) put something in the victim's javaccino. Testimony 2 insists she put white powder in it. Testimony 3 describes the victim drinking it and collapsing. Testimony 4 identifies Maggey as the defendant. Testimony 5 mentions her having a ribbon and loose apron straps. Testimony 6 says there was nothing interesting about her from the front.

Now, looking at the evidence. The key points here are the cause and method of death. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 10) states Glen died of potassium cyanide poisoning between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has both the victim's and Maggey's fingerprints and contains potassium cyanide. Evidence 16 is Potassium Cyanide with Maggey's prints found in her apron. 

But wait, Testimony 2 says Kudo saw Maggey put white powder into the coffee. However, the Coffee Cup's description mentions that the cyanide was in the coffee. But potassium cyanide is a powdery substance. So that might align. However, there's another angle: the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows two tables separated by a folding screen. The victim's table has the coffee cup knocked over, and there's an intact vase on each table. Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) mentions he broke the vase at his seat. 

Wait, Testimony 0 from Kudo says the young man (victim) was reading the sports paper. The Sports Paper (Evidence 3) has a doodle of 'MC Bomber' with a crossed-out 100,000 and a laughing face. The MC Bomber disc (Evidence 23) is a virus program found at Tender Lender. Glen's Calendar (Evidence 20) notes a meeting with "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre) on the day of the incident. The victim's Lottery Ticket (Evidence 14) was found on Maggey, which is a half-million dollar winning ticket. 

Looking for contradictions. Testimony 1 and 2 claim Maggey put powder in the coffee. But the Coffee Cup (13) has both their prints. However, the Potassium Cyanide (16) is in Maggey's apron. That seems to support the testimony. But maybe there's a contradiction elsewhere. 

Wait, the Crime Photo (12) shows the victim's table with an intact vase. But Victor's Testimony (18) says he broke the vase at his seat. That's a possible contradiction. If Victor broke the vase at his seat, but the photo shows intact vases on both tables, that would mean his vase was broken. However, the Crime Photo's description says "two dining tables are separated by a folding screen. The one closer to the camera is empty. The other one is where the victim collapsed... There is an intact vase on each table." So if Victor was at the empty table (closer to the camera), then his vase should be broken. But the photo shows both vases intact. That contradicts Victor's testimony. However, Victor's Testimony is Evidence 18, not a testimony in the list. The testimonies here are from Kudo. So maybe not directly.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 6: Kudo says there wasn't anything interesting about Maggey when he saw her from the front. But Evidence 15, the Apron, has big stains. If Maggey's apron had big stains, that might be noticeable from the front. But Kudo says there was nothing interesting. But maybe the stains were on the back? The apron's description says "small pockets but big stains." If the big stains are on the front, then Kudo's Testimony 6 contradicts that. But if the stains are on the back, maybe not. However, the testimony says "from the front," so if the stains are on the front, that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3 where Kudo says the victim took a sip, looked in pain, and collapsed. The autopsy report says cause of death is potassium cyanide. Potassium cyanide typically acts quickly, but symptoms might take a few minutes. But the testimony says he collapsed immediately after sipping. That's possible. Not sure if that's a contradiction.

Wait, another angle: the Coffee Cup (13) has a lip stain on the front and the handle to the right. If the victim was right-handed, the handle would be on the right. But if he sipped from the front, the lip stain would be there. Not sure if that's relevant.

Looking back, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 2 (Kudo saw Maggey put white powder in the coffee) and Evidence 6 (Small Bottle found in the kitchen with the victim's ear medicine and unidentified fingerprints). Wait, Evidence 6 is the victim's ear medicine, but the murder weapon was potassium cyanide in the coffee. So maybe the powder in the coffee was the cyanide, which is in Evidence 16. But Testimony 2 says the powder was put in the coffee, which aligns with Evidence 13 and 16. So perhaps no contradiction there.

Another possibility: Testimony 1 and 2 say Maggey put something in the coffee, but the Crime Photo (12) shows the coffee cup on the victim's table, and there's a knocked-over cup. If the folding screen was between the tables, could Kudo have seen Maggey from his seat? According to the floor plans (Evidence 11), if the victim was at the table behind the screen, Kudo might not have had a clear view. But Kudo's Testimony 0 says he was reading the sports paper, so maybe he was at a different table. Wait, the testimonies are from Kudo. If the Crime Photo shows that the victim's table is behind a folding screen, then Kudo couldn't have seen Maggey putting something in the coffee if he was at the other table. But Testimony 1 says he saw her do it. That could be a contradiction if the floor plan shows the tables are separated by a screen that blocks the view. Let me check the evidence: Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) says "two dining tables are separated by a folding screen. The one closer to the camera is empty. The other one is where the victim collapse..." So if Kudo was at the empty table (closer to the camera), and the victim was behind the screen, then Kudo couldn't have seen the victim's table. Therefore, Testimony 1 and 2, where Kudo claims to have seen Maggey put something in the coffee, would be impossible if the view was blocked by the folding screen. That would contradict the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) which shows the screen separating the tables. Therefore, the testimony contradicts the evidence because Kudo couldn't have seen the victim's table due to the folding screen.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 1 and 2 state that Kudo saw Maggey put powder in the victim's coffee. However, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows the victim's table separated by a folding screen from the empty table closer to the camera. If Kudo was at the empty table, the screen would block his view of the victim's table, making it impossible to witness the act.
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 1}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here.

First, I need to go through the testimonies and see what each person is saying. The testimonies are from Kudo, right? Let's look at them one by one.

Testimony 0: Kudo describes the victim as a young man with broken spectacles. Testimony 1 mentions the victim had a newspaper in his right hand and was rustling the pages. Testimony 2 says the young man was listening to the wireless (which I think means a radio). Testimony 3 states that the serving girl (probably Maggey) brought over a javaccino. Testimony 4 says the victim picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.

Now, looking at the evidence. Let's check the Autopsy Report (Evidence 10): Glen died of potassium cyanide poisoning between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has the poison, with fingerprints from both Glen and Maggey. The cup's description mentions a lip stain on the front and a handle to the right. 

But Testimony 4 says the victim used his free hand (which would be his left hand if he was holding the newspaper in his right, as per Testimony 1) to pick up the cup. However, the lip stain is on the front, implying the cup was held in the right hand (since the handle is on the right). If the victim used his left hand, the lip stain would be on the opposite side. So the testimony about using the free hand (left) contradicts the evidence of the lip stain's position, which suggests the cup was held in the right hand. Therefore, this inconsistency points to a contradiction between Testimony 4 and Evidence 13.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 4 states, "The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip." Assuming the victim was holding a newspaper in his right hand (Testimony 1), the "free hand" would be his left. However, Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup) describes the cup's lip stain as being on the front with the handle to the right, implying it was designed to be held in the right hand. This contradicts the testimony about using the left hand.
{"evidence": 13, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find a contradiction between one of the evidences and one of the testimonies. Let's start by going through the testimonies and see if any of them conflict with the evidence provided.

First, looking at the Testimonies. Testimony 2 says, "Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over." This is from Victor Kudo. He's talking about someone knocking over a vase, which broke, and the tablecloth getting soaked (as per Testimony 3). 

Now, let's check the evidence related to the crime scene. Evidence 12 is the Crime Photo, which describes the scene as having two dining tables separated by a folding screen. The photo mentions that there are "intact vase on each table." Wait a minute—Testimony 2 and 3 claim that a vase was knocked over and broken, but the Crime Photo shows both vases as intact. That's a direct contradiction. 

So, Testimony 2 (from Kudo) states that the vase was broken, but Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows both vases intact. Therefore, this is a clear contradiction between Testimony 2 and Evidence 12.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 2 states, "Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over." However, Evidence 12, the Crime Photo, describes "intact vase on each table," contradicting the claim that a vase was broken.
{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 2}

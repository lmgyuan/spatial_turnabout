Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So, the question gives a bunch of characters, evidences, and testimonies. I need to find one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, I'll start by looking through the testimonies and see if any of them have details that clash with the evidence provided. Let's go through each testimony one by one and cross-reference with the evidence.

Testimony 0 by Vasquez: She entered the trailer a little before noon. That seems straightforward, but I need to check if any evidence mentions something about the trailer around that time. Evidence 8 is the Trailer Key for Studio Two Trailer, but not sure if that's relevant yet.

Testimony 1: The meeting was from 12:00 to 4:00 PM. So the meeting lasted four hours. Evidence 4 is a Cardkey for Studio Employees, but not directly related. Evidence 18 mentions a van used to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting. Wait, but according to Testimony 3, Vasquez says she was fatigued and had Sal take her to Studio One after the meeting. That's after 4 PM, maybe. But maybe there's a contradiction here with timing?

Testimony 2: They went to Studio One after the meeting. But Evidence 18 says the van was used to drive her to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer. Hmm, that's consistent, so no conflict there.

Testimony 3: She was fatigued, so Sal took her. Again, matches Evidence 18. Not a conflict.

Testimony 4: At 2:30 PM, they took a 15-minute break. The autopsy report (Evidence 3) says time of death was 2:30 PM. So if Vasquez was in a meeting until 4 PM with a break at 2:30, how could she be involved? Wait, the victim died at 2:30 PM. So during the break, maybe someone left. But let's see if there's a testimony that contradicts the time.

Wait, let's check the testimonies again. Vasquez's Testimony 1 says the meeting ended at 4 PM, and Testimony 4 says they took a break at 2:30. So during the break, they were still in the meeting. But the autopsy says death was at 2:30 PM. If the murderer was someone else, maybe, but we need to find a contradiction between a testimony and evidence.

Looking at Evidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo taken at the gate at 2:00 PM, showing him dragging one leg. Testimony by Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene. But the photo shows Powers at 2 PM, which is before the time of death at 2:30 PM. But wait, the Security Lady's testimony isn't listed here. The testimonies provided are all from Vasquez. So maybe that's not relevant here.

Wait, the Testimonies provided here are from Vasquez only. Testimony 0-5 are all Vasquez's statements. So looking at her testimonies:

Testimony 5: "Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer." Evidence 16 is the Steak Plate with traces of sleeping pills and a large bone. The steak plate was found in the employee area. If Vasquez and Sal ate steaks in front of the trailer, but the plate was found in the employee area, maybe that's a discrepancy. Or perhaps the sleeping pills in the steak plate contradict something. Wait, Evidence 7 is an empty sleeping pill bottle with Jack Hammer's fingerprints. The steak plate has traces of sleeping pills, which might mean that the steak was drugged. But Vasquez says they ate steaks, so if the plate with sleeping pills is theirs, maybe they were drugged. But how does that contradict her testimony? She didn't mention anything about being drugged. Alternatively, if the autopsy says the victim was stabbed at 2:30 PM, but Vasquez was in a meeting until 4 PM with a break at 2:30, perhaps she couldn't have been the killer. But that's not a direct contradiction between testimony and evidence.

Wait, the key contradiction might be regarding the time of death and someone's alibi. The autopsy (Evidence 3) states time of death as 2:30 PM. Vasquez's Testimony 1 says the meeting lasted until 4 PM. But during the break at 2:30 PM, she could have left. However, Testimony 4 says "At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting." So during the break, they were on a break. If the murder happened at exactly 2:30 PM, and Vasquez was on a break, maybe she could have done it. But that's not a contradiction unless there's evidence that she couldn't have been there.

Alternatively, Evidence 11 is Mr. Monkey's Head, which blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. If the path was blocked during that time, then how did the killer get through? But Vasquez's Testimony 2 says they went to Studio One after the meeting (which ended at 4 PM), so maybe if Studio One is where the crime scene is, but the path was blocked until 4 PM. But if the murder happened at 2:30 PM, then the path was blocked, meaning the killer couldn't have accessed the scene. But the victim was already there. Hmm, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (they went to Studio One after the meeting ended at 4 PM) and Evidence 11 (path blocked until 4 PM). So if the path was blocked until 4 PM, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM, how did the killer get to the scene? Unless there's another way. But maybe the contradiction is that Vasquez claims they went to Studio One after the meeting (post 4 PM), but the murder happened at 2:30 PM, so maybe she's lying about her whereabouts.

Wait, but the testimonies from Vasquez are about her own actions. Let's check again:

Testimony 2: "There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One." The timing here would be after 4 PM. But the murder was at 2:30 PM. So if the path was blocked until 4 PM (Evidence 11), then how did the killer get to the scene before 4 PM? The victim died at 2:30 PM, so the murder happened when the path was blocked. That would mean that the killer must have been someone who was already at the scene before the path was blocked. But according to Evidence 11, the path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4 PM. So the murder occurred at 2:30 PM, after the path was blocked. So the only way for someone to commit the murder is if they were already at the scene before 2:15 PM and couldn't leave, or if there's another path. But if the only path was blocked, then the killer must have been there already.

But how does this relate to Vasquez's testimony? She was in a meeting until 4 PM, with a break at 2:30. If during the break, she couldn't access the crime scene due to the blocked path, then her alibi holds. However, if the murder weapon or another evidence contradicts her testimony.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo taken at 2:00 PM, showing him dragging one leg. If Powers was at the gate at 2:00 PM, but the Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene, but the photo shows him at the gate at 2 PM, then that could be a contradiction. However, the testimonies provided here are only from Vasquez, not the Security Lady, so that might not be the case here.

Wait, the problem states that the testimonies are from the list given. The testimonies here are Testimony 0 to 5, all by Vasquez. So the Security Lady's testimony isn't among them, so we can't use that.

Another angle: Testimony 5 by Vasquez says they ate steaks on the table in front of the trailer. Evidence 16 is the steak plate found in the employee area with sleeping pills. If they ate in front of the trailer, why was the plate found in the employee area? That might be a contradiction. But perhaps that's not directly conflicting, maybe they moved it. Alternatively, the presence of sleeping pills in the steak plate. Evidence 7 is the empty sleeping pill bottle with Jack's fingerprints. If the steak had sleeping pills, and Vasquez ate it, she might have been drugged. But she didn't mention feeling drowsy. However, that's more of an implication rather than a direct contradiction.

Wait, the autopsy report says the cause of death was a spear through the chest (Evidence 3). The murder weapon is the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6), which has a mended shaft. If the spear was broken and mended, maybe that's relevant. But how does that tie into a testimony?

Looking back at the problem statement, the user expects one pair where evidence and testimony directly contradict. The previous examples involved a testimony claiming not to have touched the murder weapon versus evidence with their prints, or a testimony about the bullet's entry point conflicting with the autopsy's location.

In this case, the possible contradiction could be regarding the time of death and someone's alibi. Let's see:

Vasquez's Testimony 1 says the meeting lasted from 12 to 4 PM. Testimony 4 says they took a break at 2:30 PM for 15 minutes. So during the break, which is 2:30 to 2:45 PM, Vasquez and others were on break. The time of death is 2:30 PM. If Vasquez was in the meeting until 4 PM, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM during the break, she could have left during the break. However, Evidence 11 says the path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4 PM. So if the path to the scene was blocked during that time, how did the killer access it? Unless the killer was already there.

But if Vasquez claims they went to Studio One after the meeting (Testimony 2 and 3), which ended at 4 PM, but the murder happened at 2:30 PM, maybe there's a contradiction. Wait, not directly. The murder could have been committed by someone else during that time.

Wait, perhaps the key contradiction is in Testimony 5 where Vasquez says they ate steaks in front of the trailer, but the Steak Plate (Evidence 16) was found in the employee area with sleeping pills. If they ate in front of the trailer, the plate should be there, not in the employee area. So that's a location discrepancy. But maybe that's a stretch. Alternatively, the steak plate has traces of sleeping pills, implying that the steaks were drugged. If Vasquez and Sal ate them but didn't mention being drowsy, but that's not a direct contradiction.

Another angle: The Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) has a mended break. Maybe a testimony about the spear being intact contradicts that. But the testimonies here don't mention the spear's condition.

Alternatively, the Script (Evidence 10) is mentioned in Vasquez's Memo (Evidence 9), which says "Bring me the script from Episode 13." If Vasquez had the script, but the testimony doesn't mention it. Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the time of death. Autopsy says 2:30 PM. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4 PM (Evidence 11), then the killer couldn't have entered or exited during that time. So the killer must have been there before 2:15 PM. But the defendant is Will Powers. Evidence 5 is a photo of Powers at 2:00 PM at the gate, dragging one leg. If the Security Lady claims she saw Powers heading to the scene (but her testimony isn't listed here), but according to the photo, he was at the gate at 2 PM. But since the Security Lady's testimony isn't in the given testimonies, we can't use that.

Alternatively, let's look at the Cardkey (Evidence 4). It grants access to Studio One. If Vasquez went to Studio One after 4 PM (Testimony 2), but the murder occurred in Studio One at 2:30 PM, then how did they get in if the path was blocked? But that's more about the blocked path.

Wait, the blocked path (Evidence 11) is Mr. Monkey's Head blocking the path to the scene between 2:15 PM and 4 PM. So if the scene was in Studio One, and the path was blocked, then the murder couldn't have occurred there unless the killer was already inside. But the victim was killed there at 2:30 PM. So the killer must have been there before 2:15 PM and couldn't leave until after 4 PM. But Vasquez's Testimony 1 says she was in a meeting until 4 PM. If she was in the meeting, but the murder occurred in Studio One at 2:30 PM, which was blocked off, then how could she have done it? Unless she wasn't there. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Vasquez's Testimony 5 about eating steaks and the Steak Plate (Evidence 16) with sleeping pills. If she claims they ate steaks but the plate has sleeping pills, which she didn't mention, but that's more of an omission than a contradiction.

Wait, another angle: The autopsy says cause of death was a spear through the chest (Evidence 3), but the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) has a mended break. If the spear was broken and then fixed with duct tape, perhaps the spear wasn't intact at the time of the murder. But if the murder happened with the spear, then the mended break would mean it was broken before. But how does that tie into a testimony?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5 where Vasquez says they ate steaks in front of the trailer, but the Steak Plate (Evidence 16) was found in the employee area with sleeping pills. This could imply that the steaks were moved or that someone else ate them. But this might be a stretch.

Wait, let's go back to the time of death. Autopsy says 2:30 PM. Testimony 4 by Vasquez says they took a break at 2:30 PM for 15 minutes. So during that break, Vasquez and others were not in the meeting. If the murder happened at exactly 2:30 PM, then Vasquez could have been at the scene during the break. However, if the path to the scene was blocked from 2:15 PM, then she couldn't have accessed it. So Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head blocking the path) and Vasquez's Testimony 4 (break at 2:30 PM) might contradict if she needed to be at the scene but couldn't access it. But this requires assuming that the path to the scene was the only way, which the evidence says it was blocked. So if the murder happened at 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, then the killer must have been there before 2:15 PM and couldn't leave. But Vasquez was in a meeting until 4 PM, so she couldn't have been there before 2:15 PM unless she left earlier.

Alternatively, the defendant is Will Powers. Evidence 5 shows him at the gate at 2:00 PM, dragging his leg. If the murder happened at 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, then Powers would have had to be at the scene before 2:15 PM. But the photo shows him at the gate at 2:00 PM. If the gate is outside the path that's blocked, maybe he couldn't get in. But again, this is about Powers, not directly related to Vasquez's testimonies.

Hmm. I'm struggling a bit here. Let me try to recap the key points.

The most straightforward contradictions in previous examples were direct contradictions between a testimony statement and an evidence fact. Like a testimony saying "I didn't touch the weapon" vs evidence showing their prints on it.

Looking for something similar here. So, which testimony says something that is directly contradicted by evidence?

Vasquez's Testimony 5: "Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer." The Steak Plate (Evidence 16) is found in the employee area with sleeping pills. If they ate in front of the trailer, why is the plate in the employee area? That's a location contradiction. But maybe they moved it, but it's a possible discrepancy.

Alternatively, the Steak Plate has traces of sleeping pills. If Vasquez and Sal ate the steaks, they would have ingested the pills. But if the autopsy report doesn't mention them being drugged, maybe. However, the victim's autopsy doesn't relate to that. Alternatively, the sleeping pills are linked to Evidence 7, which is an empty bottle with Jack's prints. If the steak was drugged, maybe Jack was the one who took the pills, but that's a different angle.

Another angle: Testimony 1 says the meeting ended at 4 PM, and Testimony 2 says they went to Studio One afterwards. But the murder occurred at 2:30 PM in Studio One (assuming the crime scene is Studio One). If the path was blocked until 4 PM, then how did the killer get in? So if the murder weapon was in Studio One, and the path was blocked, then the killer must have been there before 2:15 PM. But Vasquez claims they went to Studio One after 4 PM. If she went there after 4 PM, but the murder happened earlier, that doesn't directly contradict unless she claims she was there at the time. But she doesn't. She just says they went there after the meeting.

Alternatively, the photo of Powers (Evidence 5) at 2:00 PM shows him at the gate. If the Security Lady's testimony (not listed here) says she saw him at the scene, but the photo shows him elsewhere, that's a contradiction. But since the testimonies provided are only Vasquez's, that's not applicable here.

Wait, let's check the evidences again. Evidence 18: Van used to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting. Testimony 3: Vasquez was fatigued and had Sal take her. So they used the van to go to Studio One after 4 PM. But if the murder happened at 2:30 PM in Studio One, and the path was blocked until 4 PM, then how did the body get there? Or maybe the crime scene is in a different location.

Alternatively, the murder weapon (Samurai Spear) was mended with duct tape (Evidence 6). If someone's testimony claims the spear was intact, that would be a contradiction. But none of the provided testimonies mention the spear's condition.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again. The most likely contradiction is between the time of death and someone's alibi. Vasquez says she was in a meeting until 4 PM with a break at 2:30 PM. The murder happened at 2:30 PM. If the path to the scene was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4 PM (Evidence 11), then the killer must have been there before 2:15 PM. But Vasquez was in the meeting, so she couldn't have been there before. Unless she left during the break. But the path was blocked, so she couldn't get through. Therefore, her alibi holds, but maybe another contradiction exists.

Wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) says the cause was a spear through the chest. The Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) is the murder weapon. If the spear was mended, maybe it couldn't have been used unless it was fixed after the murder. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, the Cardkey (Evidence 4) grants access to Studio One. If the murder happened there, and the defendant (Powers) couldn't have accessed it without the cardkey. But Evidence 5 shows Powers at the gate at 2:00 PM, which might imply he wasn't in Studio One. But again, without the Security Lady's testimony, this isn't directly a contradiction here.

Wait, let's look at Testimony 5 again: "Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer." The Steak Plate (Evidence 16) is found in the employee area. If they ate in front of the trailer, the plate should be there, not in the employee area. So that's a contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 16. But the user's previous examples had a direct contradiction like "I didn't touch the weapon" vs "prints on weapon". This one is more about location discrepancy.

Alternatively, the Steak Plate has traces of sleeping pills. If Vasquez and Sal ate the steaks, they should have been drugged, but they didn't mention it. But maybe the pills were in the victim's system. Evidence 7 is the empty sleeping pill bottle with Jack's prints. If Jack took the pills, but the steak plate has traces, maybe the pills were used to drug someone else. But this is getting too convoluted.

Wait, maybe the key contradiction is regarding the time of death and the blocked path. The murder happened at 2:30 PM, but the path was blocked from 2:15 PM. So the killer had to be there before 2:15 PM. However, if the defendant (Powers) was photographed at the gate at 2:00 PM (Evidence 5), then he couldn't have entered the scene after 2:15 PM. But this would require the Security Lady's testimony, which isn't listed here. Since the testimonies given are only from Vasquez, perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere.

Alternatively, let's look at Evidence 18: The van was used to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting. Testimony 2 says they went to Studio One after the meeting. So they used the van. But the murder happened at 2:30 PM, which is during the meeting. So how did the victim get there if the path was blocked? The victim, Jack Hammer, was in the studio before the path was blocked. So perhaps the contradiction isn't here.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me try to focus on the most direct contradiction possible. In previous examples, it was a testimony vs evidence about the same fact. Here, maybe the same.

Testimony 5 by Vasquez: Ate steaks in front of the trailer. Evidence 16: Steak plate found in employee area with sleeping pills. The locations don't match. So the testimony says the plate was in front of the trailer, but evidence says it was in the employee area. That's a contradiction. Therefore, {"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}

But wait, the problem says to output evidence and testimony numbers. Let's check the numbers:

Evidence 16: Steak Plate

Testimony 5: Vasquez's Testimony 5 about eating steaks in front of the trailer.

So that would be {"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}

But I need to confirm if this is correct. The contradiction is that she says they ate in front of the trailer, but the plate was found elsewhere. That's a location discrepancy, which could imply that she's lying about where they ate, which might suggest something else.

Alternatively, if the steak plate has sleeping pills, and she didn't mention them being in the food, but that's not a direct contradiction unless she claims they didn't take pills.

Another possibility: Testimony 1 says the meeting ended at 4 PM, but Evidence 18 says the van was used to drive to Studio One after the meeting. But the murder happened at 2:30 PM, so the van wasn't used until after 4 PM. That's not a contradiction.

Wait, let's check the times again. The murder was at 2:30 PM. The meeting was from 12 to 4 PM, with a break at 2:30 PM. During the break, Vasquez and others were on break. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4 PM, then during the break (2:30-2:45), they couldn't access the scene. So if the murder happened at 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked, how did the killer get there? The killer must have been there before 2:15 PM. But Vasquez was in the meeting until 4 PM, so she couldn't have been there unless she left during the break. But the blocked path would prevent her from getting there. So her alibi holds. Therefore, no contradiction here.

Alternatively, the defendant is Will Powers. Evidence 5 shows him at the gate at 2:00 PM. If the murder happened at 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, then he couldn't have accessed the scene after 2:15 PM. But the photo shows him at the gate at 2:00 PM. If he entered before 2:15 PM, he could have been there. But if the Security Lady's testimony (not provided) says she saw him later, that's a contradiction. But since we can't use her testimony, this isn't applicable.

Back to Vasquez's testimonies. The most direct contradiction seems to be between Testimony 5 and Evidence 16 regarding the location of the steak plate. So I think that's the intended pair here.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 5 states that Dee Vasquez and Sal Manella ate steaks in front of the trailer. However, Evidence 16 (Steak Plate) was found in the employee area with traces of sleeping pills, contradicting the location mentioned in the testimony.
{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to look at the characters, evidences, and testimonies provided to find contradictions between an evidence and a testimony.

Starting with the characters, there's Maya Fey, Miles Edgeworth, Detective Gumshoe, Will Powers (the defendant), Security Lady, Jack Hammer (victim), and others. The evidences include an autopsy report, a spear as the murder weapon, photos, a cardkey, and more. The testimonies are from Vasquez, who's a producer at Global Studios.

Looking at the testimonies by Vasquez (Testimony 0 to 7), I need to check each against the evidence. Let's go through them one by one.

Testimony 0: Vasquez says she was with Sal and Oldbag when they found the body. Evidence 0 is the Attorney's Badge, which doesn't seem related. Maybe check other testimonies.

Testimony 1: She mentions the assistant was there, only Powers was absent. Evidence 5 is a photo of Powers at 2:00 PM, which might show he was present elsewhere. Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 3) states time of death as 2:30 PM. If the Security Lady claims she saw Powers heading to the scene (Character 4's description), but the photo (Evidence 5) shows Powers at 2:00 PM dragging a leg, maybe he couldn't have been at the scene later?

Wait, Testimony 1 says Powers was absent when they found the body. But when Vasquez called the police (Testimony 2), Powers showed up. The murder was at 2:30 PM. The photo (Evidence 5) shows Powers at 2:00 PM, but if the path was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM, then after 2:15 PM, access was blocked. So if the murder happened at 2:30 PM, how did Powers get there if the path was blocked? But the Security Lady (Character 4) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene. Maybe contradiction here.

Wait, let's check Evidence 5: "Powers'(?) Photo: Taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios. [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2] He's dragging one leg." If he was at the gate at 2:00 PM, and the murder happened at 2:30 PM, but the path was blocked from 2:15 PM onward (Evidence 11), then he couldn't have reached the scene after 2:15 PM. Therefore, Testimony 3 from Vasquez says Oldbag pointed at Powers, claiming he did it. But Evidence 5 and 11 together suggest Powers couldn't have been at the scene at 2:30 PM. So the Security Lady's claim (Character 4's testimony) is contradicted by Evidence 5 and 11. However, the testimonies provided here are all from Vasquez, not the Security Lady. Wait, looking back at the Testimonies section, the Testimonies 0-7 are all from Vasquez. The Security Lady's testimony isn't listed here. Wait, the user provided Testimonies 0-7 under "Testimonies:" and each is attributed to Vasquez except maybe some? Let me check:

Testimony 0: Person: Vasquez  
Testimony 1: Person: Vasquez  
... up to Testimony 7: Person: Vasquez.

So all testimonies here are from Vasquez. So maybe need to find a contradiction between Vasquez's testimony and one of the evidences.

Looking at Vasquez's Testimony 7: "I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind." Let's check Evidence 17: Five-Year-Old Photo showing an accident involving Jack Hammer. If Hammer was injured, maybe that's related. But how does that contradict?

Alternatively, Testimony 1: "The assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent." But Evidence 5 shows Powers at the gate at 2:00 PM, and the murder was at 2:30 PM. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, maybe Powers couldn't have been at the scene. But Vasquez's Testimony 1 says Powers was absent when they found the body. Wait, when was the body found? The autopsy says time of death is 2:30 PM. If they found the body after that, perhaps Powers wasn't there. But Vasquez's Testimony 2 says "I immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up." So when the police were called, Powers arrived. But if the path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM (Evidence 11), how could Powers show up after 2:15 PM? Unless he was already there before the path was blocked. The photo at 2:00 PM shows him at the gate. If the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, maybe he entered before then. But then the murder happened at 2:30 PM. So if he was already past the blocked path, he could be at the scene. Hmm, this might not be a direct contradiction.

Another angle: Testimony 3: Vasquez says Oldbag accused Powers. If Oldbag's claim is that she saw Powers heading to the scene, but Evidence 11 (blocked path from 2:15 PM) and Evidence 5 (Powers at gate at 2:00 PM) suggest he couldn't have accessed the scene after 2:15 PM. However, Oldbag's testimony isn't part of the given testimonies here; the testimonies provided are all from Vasquez. So perhaps we need to look at Vasquez's own testimonies.

Wait, looking at Testimony 5: Vasquez says she went back to the trailer to get her script and direction notes. Evidence 10 is the Script from Episode 13, which Vasquez's Memo (Evidence 9) mentions. So maybe she went to get that script. Not sure about a contradiction here.

Looking at Testimony 7: Vasquez says she left Hammer behind because he was injured. Evidence 17 is a photo of Hammer's accident five years ago. If Hammer was injured recently, maybe that's a contradiction? But the five-year-old photo might not relate to current injury. Alternatively, Evidence 3's autopsy shows he was killed by a spear. The murder weapon is Evidence 6, the Samurai Spear with a mended break. Maybe Vasquez's testimony about leaving Hammer behind because he couldn't do action scenes, but the murder involved a spear thrust which requires some action. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 from Vasquez: Oldbag said Powers did it. But Evidence 5 shows Powers at the gate at 2:00 PM. If the murder was at 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, maybe Powers couldn't have been there. But the testimonies are from Vasquez, not Oldbag, so maybe the contradiction is in Vasquez's Testimony 1 where she says Powers was absent, but Evidence 5 shows he was present at 2:00 PM. Wait, but the photo is at 2:00 PM, and the murder is at 2:30 PM. If Testimony 1 refers to the time when the body was found, which is after 2:30 PM, then maybe Powers wasn't there when the body was found. But the photo at 2:00 PM doesn't necessarily contradict that.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 5 says Vasquez went to get the script from the trailer. Evidence 10 is the script from Episode 13, and Evidence 9 is Vasquez's memo saying to bring the script. If she went to get it, but the script was found elsewhere? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the key contradiction is between Testimony 1 where Vasquez says Powers was absent when they found the body, but Evidence 5's photo shows Powers was present at the studio gate at 2:00 PM. If the body was found after 2:30 PM, then Powers might have left or been elsewhere. However, the Security Lady (Oldbag) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene (Character 4's description). But since the testimonies here are all from Vasquez, maybe Vasquez's Testimony 1 (saying Powers was absent) is contradicted by Evidence 5 (showing Powers was present at the gate at 2:00 PM). But if the group found the body later, maybe Powers wasn't there then. The autopsy says death at 2:30 PM, so they would have found the body after that. If Powers was at the gate at 2:00 PM, but the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, he couldn't have been at the scene after 2:15 PM. Therefore, when they found the body (after 2:30 PM), Powers couldn't have been there, supporting Vasquez's Testimony 1. Hmm, maybe not a contradiction here.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 from Vasquez: Oldbag pointed at Powers, but Evidence 5 and 11 suggest he couldn't have been there. But again, the testimonies here are from Vasquez, not Oldbag.

Wait, perhaps looking at Testimony 7: "I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind." If Hammer was injured, but the murder method was a spear through the chest (Evidence 3), maybe implying the victim couldn't have put up a fight. However, that's not a direct contradiction with evidence.

Another angle: Testimony 2: Vasquez called the police, then Powers showed up. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, how did Powers show up after that? Unless he was already there. The photo at 2:00 PM shows him at the gate. If the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, he might have entered before that and been stuck there. Then, after the murder at 2:30 PM, when Vasquez called the police (after finding the body), Powers could have been on the scene. But that's speculative.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Vasquez says Oldbag accused Powers) and Evidence 5 (photo showing Powers at the gate at 2:00 PM) along with Evidence 11 (path blocked from 2:15 PM). If Powers was at the gate at 2:00 PM, he could have entered before 2:15 PM when the path was blocked, making it possible for him to be at the scene. But that doesn't directly contradict the testimony. Alternatively, if the Security Lady (Oldbag) claims to have seen Powers heading to the scene after 2:15 PM, that would contradict Evidence 11, but her testimony isn't listed here.

Since the question asks for a contradiction between evidence and testimony from the provided list, the answer must be among the given testimonies (all from Vasquez) and the provided evidence.

Wait, looking back, Testimony 7: "I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind." If Hammer was injured, perhaps he couldn't have been in a position to be attacked in an action scene, but the murder happened via a spear thrust. However, the autopsy doesn't mention Hammer's prior injury, so this might not be a contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 5: "I went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes." Evidence 18 is the van used to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting. If she went to the trailer, maybe the van's use contradicts her testimony? Not sure.

Wait, Evidence 18: "Van: Manella used this van to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer." If Vasquez's Testimony 5 says she went back to the trailer to get the script, but the van was used to drive her to Studio One after the meeting, maybe there's a timeline issue. If the meeting was in the trailer, then after the meeting, Manella drove her to Studio One. But if she later went back to the trailer (Testimony 5), perhaps that's possible, but not a direct contradiction.

Another approach: The murder weapon is the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) with a mended break. If Vasquez's testimony involves the script from Episode 13 (Evidence 10), which might have details about the spear. But I'm not seeing a direct contradiction.

Wait, let's check the time of death again. Autopsy (Evidence 3) says 2:30 PM. The photo of Powers (Evidence 5) is at 2:00 PM. The path was blocked from 2:15 PM (Evidence 11). So if Powers was at the gate at 2:00 PM, he could have entered before 2:15 PM and been present at the murder scene at 2:30 PM. Then, after the murder, the path was blocked, so when Vasquez and others found the body, Powers couldn't leave, hence he showed up when the police were called. That doesn't contradict anything.

Alternatively, maybe Vasquez's Testimony 7 about Hammer's injury is contradicted by the autopsy report. If Hammer was injured and couldn't perform action scenes, but the cause of death was a spear thrust which requires some action, but that's a stretch.

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Vasquez's Testimony 1 stating that Powers was absent when they found the body, and the photo (Evidence 5) showing he was present at 2:00 PM. But if they found the body after 2:30 PM, Powers could have been there earlier and left before the path was blocked, but that's not necessarily a contradiction. Alternatively, if the photo shows Powers dragging one leg, which might indicate an injury, but the spear attack requires strength. However, that's more about capability than presence.

Alternatively, Testimony 7: Vasquez left Hammer behind because he was injured, but the autopsy report (Evidence 3) shows he died from a spear wound. If Hammer was too injured to move, how did he end up at the murder scene? But the autopsy doesn't mention prior injuries affecting mobility. So this is speculative.

Hmm. Maybe I need to look for a direct contradiction between a testimony and an evidence. For example, if a testimony claims something happened at a certain time, but evidence shows a different time.

Looking at Testimony 4: Vasquez says "I asked to be left out of the proceedings." But this seems more of a statement of intent rather than a factual claim that can be contradicted by evidence.

Testimony 6: "Then I went home." If there's evidence showing she was somewhere else, but no such evidence is listed.

Wait, Evidence 7: Empty Bottle → Sleeping Pill Bottle with Jack's fingerprints. If Vasquez's Testimony 7 says she left Hammer behind because he was injured, but the sleeping pills were found with Jack's prints, maybe implying he took them, which could relate to his state at the time of death. But if he was drugged, maybe that's why he couldn't defend himself. Not a contradiction.

Wait, another thought: Testimony 3 from Vasquez says Oldbag accused Powers, but if the photo (Evidence 5) shows Powers was present at 2:00 PM, and the path blocked at 2:15 PM, then Powers could have been at the scene before the blockage. The murder at 2:30 PM would require him to be there after 2:15 PM, but the path was blocked. So if the murder weapon was the spear found in the victim, and the path was blocked, then how did Powers escape? The contradiction would be between the photo showing him at the gate (Evidence 5) and the blocked path (Evidence 11), but that's not directly a testimony.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 1 where Vasquez says "Only Powers was absent" when they found the body, and the photo (Evidence 5) showing Powers at the gate at 2:00 PM. If the body was found after 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, then Powers couldn't have been there. But Vasquez's Testimony 1 is about who was present when they found the body, not about Powers' location at the time of the murder. The photo shows him at 2:00 PM, which is before the murder. So if he was absent when the body was found (after 2:30 PM), that doesn't contradict the photo. 

Wait, another angle: The autopsy says the cause was a spear through the chest. The spear (Evidence 6) has a mended break. If the murderer had to mend it, maybe that's relevant. But how does that relate to testimonies?

Alternatively, the Security Lady (Oldbag) claims she saw Powers heading to the scene (Character 4's description), which would be contradicted by the blocked path (Evidence 11) if that sighting was after 2:15 PM. But since Oldbag's testimony isn't listed here, only Vasquez's, maybe the contradiction is not in the given testimonies.

Wait, but the user provided testimonies, all from Vasquez, so the answer must be among those.

Perhaps the key contradiction is in Testimony 4 from Vasquez: "A shot! The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead!" But this is from a previous example. In the current problem, the murder is by spear, not bullet. Wait, no, in the current problem, the murder is by spear. The autopsy (Evidence 3) says "pierced through the chest by a spear." However, Testimony 4 in the previous example was about a bullet, but here, the testimonies are different.

Wait, looking back at the current problem's testimonies:

Testimony 4 (from Vasquez): "A shot! The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead!" No, wait, no. Wait, the current question's testimonies are:

Wait, no. In the current question, the Testimonies are from Vasquez, and they are numbered 0 to 7. Let me check again:

Testimony 0: Vasquez was with Sal and Oldbag when they found the body.

Testimony 1: The assistant was there, only Powers was absent.

Testimony 2: Called police, then Powers showed up.

Testimony 3: Oldbag accused Powers.

Testimony 4: Asked to be left out.

Testimony 5: Went to trailer to get script.

Testimony 6: Went home.

Testimony 7: Knew Hammer was injured, left him behind.

Looking for a contradiction between any of these and the evidences.

Evidence 3: Autopsy report says death by spear through the chest at 2:30 PM.

Evidence 5: Photo of Powers at 2:00 PM at the gate, dragging one leg.

Evidence 11: Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM.

If the murder happened at 2:30 PM, and the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, then the murderer must have been at the scene before 2:15 PM. Powers was photographed at the gate at 2:00 PM. If he entered before 2:15 PM, he could be at the scene. But when the body was found (after 2:30 PM), the path was blocked, so how did he leave? Unless he was still there, hence Testimony 2 says Powers showed up after the police were called. But if the path was blocked, how did he arrive? This might suggest a contradiction between Testimony 2 (Powers showed up after police were called) and Evidence 11 (path blocked). Because if the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, Powers couldn't have arrived after that time unless he was already there. So if Vasquez called the police after finding the body (post 2:30 PM), and then Powers showed up, but the path was blocked, he couldn't have come through. Therefore, Testimony 2 contradicts Evidence 11 and 5. But the direct contradiction would be Testimony 2 ("Powers showed up") and Evidence 11 (path blocked), implying he couldn't have arrived. So the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 11.

But wait, the JSON answer requires an evidence and a testimony. So in this case, Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head blocking the path) contradicts Testimony 2 (Powers showed up after police were called). Because if the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, Powers couldn't have entered the scene after that. If the police were called after 2:30 PM, Powers couldn't have arrived through the blocked path. Hence, the testimony that Powers showed up contradicts the blocked path evidence.

Thus, the answer would be {"evidence": 11, "testimony": 2}.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 2 states, "Then Powers showed up." However, Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head) indicates the path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM. If the murder occurred at 2:30 PM and the path was blocked, Powers couldn't have arrived afterward unless he was already present. This contradicts Testimony 2 where he arrives after the police were called.
{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 2}

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. Let me start by going through the evidence and testimonies provided.

First, looking at the characters, there are several, but maybe the key ones here are Max, the accused magician, Regina Berry, the victim's daughter, and others like Ben and Acro. The evidence includes things like the autopsy report, a broken bottle, a scarf with pepper stains, and a note that lured the victim.

Now, the testimonies are all from Trilo Quist, who is Ben's puppet. The testimonies 0-5 are about Trilo wanting to propose to Regina with a ring, claiming he had the ring in his pocket that night and still has it. 

Looking at Evidence 10: the Ring. It's described as a cheap ring with "From T to R" engraved. "T" could stand for Trilo, and "R" for Regina. But according to Testimony 5, Trilo says he still has the ring in his pocket because he couldn't give it to her. However, Evidence 10 is the ring found, which should be the same ring Trilo claims to still possess. So if the ring was found as evidence, that contradicts Trilo's testimony that he still has it. Therefore, Testimony 5 (where he says he still has the ring) and Evidence 10 (the ring being found) contradict each other.

Let's think step by step:
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states, "In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!" However, Evidence 10, the "Ring," is described as a ring engraved "From T to R," implying it was intended for Regina. If Trilo still had the ring in his pocket, it contradicts the existence of Evidence 10 as a separate item found elsewhere.
{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's take a look at the characters, evidence, and testimonies here. The case involves the murder of Russell Berry, the ringmaster of the Berry Big Circus. The key is to find contradictions between the evidence and the testimonies provided.

First, the testimonies from Moe (Testimonies 0-4) all claim that he saw a shadow that could only belong to Max, specifically mentioning Max's symbols: the silk hat, black cloak, and that he couldn't see what the figure was carrying because the cloak was fluttering. 

Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 3 is the Silk Hat found at the crime scene, which is part of Max's signature items. However, Evidence 15 is the Max G. Bust, a bronze statue described as looking rather heavy. The Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows the victim's footprints leading to where he was found, but there's also the Wooden Box (Evidence 12) which was 20 lbs and locked. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) states the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the back of the head. 

The contradiction here might be between Moe's testimony about seeing Max's symbols (like the silk hat and cloak) and the actual murder weapon. If the murder weapon was the bronze bust (Evidence 15), which is heavy, but Max's cloak was fluttering, implying he was carrying something light or nothing at all. Alternatively, considering the Autopsy Report says the cause was blunt force trauma, maybe the bust was used. But Moe's testimony says he couldn't see what the figure was carrying because of the fluttering cloak. However, the bust is heavy and might not be easily carried without notice. Wait, but the bust was taken from the cafeteria before the crime. If Max was seen with his symbols, but the murder weapon was the bust, which is heavy, how could he carry it under the cloak without Moe noticing? Alternatively, perhaps the bust wasn't moved by Max, which contradicts Moe's testimony that Max was there. 

Wait, the main contradiction I see is between Testimony 1 where Moe says he saw Max's symbols (silk hat, cloak) and that there's no doubt it was him. But Evidence 3 is the silk hat found at the crime scene. If Max's hat was found there, then he might have left it, but the testimony claims he was wearing it. Wait, if the hat was found at the scene, but Moe saw someone wearing the hat, that would imply the hat was both at the scene and on Max's head, which could be a contradiction. Alternatively, if the hat was found at the scene, but Moe claims Max was wearing it, that suggests the hat should have been on Max, not left behind. But maybe the testimony is saying he saw the hat on the figure, but the evidence shows the hat was left there, meaning Max couldn't have been wearing it if it's found at the scene. Therefore, the testimony that he saw the silk hat (Testimony 2) contradicts Evidence 3 (Silk Hat found at crime scene), implying that if the hat was left there, the figure couldn't have been wearing it. Alternatively, maybe another point: the cause of death is blunt force trauma (Evidence 11), but if Max's symbols include a cloak and hat, but the weapon was the bust (heavy), how would that align? Wait, maybe the contradiction is between the Autopsy Report (blunt force) and the testimonies that imply Max was the perpetrator with his symbols, but the actual weapon was the bust. But perhaps a more direct contradiction is between the testimony that Moe saw Max's symbols (including the silk hat) and the fact that the silk hat was found at the crime scene. If the hat was found there, then the person Moe saw couldn't have been Max if Max's hat was left behind. Therefore, Testimony 2 (mentioning the silk hat) contradicts Evidence 3 (the hat found at the scene), as the presence of the hat at the scene suggests it wasn't being worn by the assailant at the time Moe claims to have seen it.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 2 states, "His silk hat. That black cloak. They were all there!" However, Evidence 3, the "Silk Hat," was found at the crime scene. If the hat was left there, the assailant couldn't have been wearing it during the crime, contradicting Moe's claim of seeing it on the figure.
{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. I need to find a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony. Let me start by reviewing all the provided information.

First, the characters: there are several involved, but the key ones here might be Max, the accused magician, and others related to the circus. The evidence includes things like the Crime Photo, Autopsy Report, Max's items, and testimonies from Moe the clown.

Looking at the testimonies, Testimony 0 from Moe says, "There's no doubt in my mind! There were no white roses that night!" Then Testimony 1 adds, "However, all of the other symbols were there... I'm equally sure of that. Especially the silk hat! There is no way I could forget seeing the decorations on it! He was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!" So Moe is certain that Max's symbols (silk hat, cloak) were present except for the white roses.

Now, looking at the evidence, Evidence 4 is the Max G. Promo Poster, which mentions his three symbols: silk hat, cloak, and white roses. But according to Moe's testimony, the white roses weren't there that night. However, the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows the victim lying on a case in the snow with footprints leading to him. Wait, maybe that's not directly related.

Wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) states the cause of death is blunt force trauma to the back of the head. But Testimony 3 from Moe says Max was wearing the silk hat the entire time. If the murder weapon was something like the Max G. Bust (Evidence 15), which is a bronze statue, maybe there's a contradiction there. Wait, no, the Bust is mentioned as being taken from the cafeteria before the crime. Hmm.

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Moe's Testimony 0 and 1, where he says there were no white roses, but the promo poster (Evidence 4) lists white roses as one of Max's symbols. But the poster is just promotional material, not necessarily indicating they were present that night. Alternatively, maybe another evidence shows that white roses were present, contradicting Moe's testimony.

Wait, let me check the other evidence. Evidence 3 is the Silk Hat found at the crime scene. Evidence 4's promo poster includes white roses as symbols, but Moe says there were none. However, is there any evidence that actually mentions white roses being present or not? The Crime Photo (Evidence 2) doesn't mention roses. The Silk Hat (Evidence 3) is present. The Grand Prix Photo (Evidence14) shows Max with a bust next to him, but not sure about roses. The Note (Evidence16) mentions the meeting but not roses. The Max G. Bust (Evidence15) is bronze. 

Wait, the contradiction might be between Moe's testimony that Max was wearing the silk hat the entire time (Testimony3) and the fact that the Silk Hat (Evidence3) was found at the crime scene. If Max was wearing it the whole time, how did it end up at the crime scene? But that depends on the timeline. Maybe the crime scene is where Max was, so it's not contradictory. Alternatively, maybe the Bust (Evidence15) was the murder weapon, which is heavy, but the cause of death is blunt force trauma. If the Bust was used, but Moe says Max was wearing the hat the whole time, implying he was present, but maybe the Bust was moved from the cafeteria. Not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The Autopsy Report (Evidence11) says the cause was blunt force trauma to the back of the head. If the murder weapon was the Max G. Bust (Evidence15), which is heavy, that could cause such an injury. But if Max was wearing the silk hat (as per Testimony3), maybe he used the hat as part of the murder? But the hat is a fedora, not a heavy object. Alternatively, the Bust being the murder weapon would require someone to have moved it. But Moe's testimony that Max was wearing the hat the entire time might not directly contradict unless the hat's presence at the crime scene (Evidence3) is mentioned. Wait, Evidence3 is the Silk Hat found at the crime scene. So if Moe says Max was wearing it the entire time, but the hat was found at the scene, that implies he left it there, which could be a contradiction. But Testimony3 says "He was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!" So if the scene is where the crime happened, and the hat was found there, maybe that's not a contradiction. Unless the hat was found elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is between Moe's Testimony0 (no white roses) and the promo poster (Evidence4) which lists white roses as a symbol, but that's just a promotional item, not evidence they were present that night. Maybe another piece of evidence shows white roses were present. Let me check again. The Crime Photo (Evidence2) doesn't mention roses. The Stage Costume (Evidence17) is a vest, not related. The Grand Prix Photo (Evidence14) shows Max holding a trophy with two girls and a bust. No mention of roses. The Silk Hat (Evidence3) is part of Max's symbols. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between the Autopsy Report (Evidence11) stating blunt force trauma to the back of the head and Testimony3 where Moe claims Max was wearing the silk hat the entire time. If the victim was hit on the back of the head, maybe the attacker was behind him, but Moe's testimony might imply Max was in front. But that's more about positioning rather than direct evidence contradiction.

Alternatively, the Broken Bottle (Evidence7) is an orange juice bottle found in the cafeteria. If Moe's testimony about Max being present with the hat, but the bottle is broken elsewhere, maybe. Not sure.

Wait, the Note (Evidence16) was a message to the murderer to meet at 10 PM. The Autopsy Report says time of death is 10:15 PM. If the meeting was at 10 PM, perhaps the timeline is involved. But I'm not seeing a direct contradiction here.

Going back, the most straightforward contradiction is between Testimony0 by Moe stating there were no white roses that night and Evidence4 (Max's Promo Poster) which includes white roses as his symbols. However, the promo poster is just a promotional item and doesn't necessarily prove white roses were present that night. So maybe that's not a solid contradiction.

Wait, another angle: Testimony2 says Moe is sure about the silk hat's decorations. The Silk Hat (Evidence3) is found at the crime scene. If Moe says Max was wearing it the entire time, but it's found at the scene, perhaps implying Max left it there, but that's not necessarily a contradiction unless there's evidence he couldn't have left it. Alternatively, maybe the hat being at the scene contradicts Moe's statement that Max was wearing it the entire time. For example, if the crime happened after Max left, but Moe says he was wearing it the entire time he was on the scene. But if the scene is the crime location, then leaving the hat there would mean he wasn't wearing it the entire time. So the contradiction would be between Testimony3 ("He was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!") and Evidence3 (the hat being found at the crime scene). If he was wearing it the entire time, it shouldn't be left at the scene. Therefore, Evidence3 (Silk Hat found at crime scene) contradicts Testimony3 (wearing it entire time). 

But let me check the exact wording. Testimony3: "He was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!" So if the scene is the crime scene, and the hat is found there, maybe he took it off after being there, but Moe claims he was wearing it the entire time. So that would be a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence3 (Silk Hat found at crime scene) contradicts Testimony3 (he was wearing it entire time on the scene). So the pair would be Evidence3 and Testimony3.

But I need to confirm. The Evidence3 is the Silk Hat found at the crime scene. Testimony3 says Max was wearing it the entire time he was on the scene. So if the hat is found at the scene, that implies he took it off, contradicting the testimony that he never took it off. Therefore, that's a contradiction.

Let's think step by step:
Testimony 3 states that Max was wearing the silk hat "the entire time that he was on the scene." However, Evidence 3 (Silk Hat) describes it as being "found at the crime scene," implying that it was left there, contradicting the claim that he never took it off.

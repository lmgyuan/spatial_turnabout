Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 6 states, "By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped." However, Evidence 7, which is "Weather Data," states that snow was present from 7 to approximately 10:50 PM, and lightning was present from 10 to approximately 11 PM, which implies that snow was still present at the time of the murder.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 6}
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 2 states, "I stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern." However, Evidence 20, which is "Stone Lantern," states that the lantern was not lit the night of the crime, which implies that Maya may not have been able to see the person behind her attacker.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 2}
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "The torches were lit... And the body was gone." However, Evidence 20, which is "Stone Lantern," states that the lantern was not lit the night of the crime, which implies that the torches may not have been lit when Maya arrived at the scene.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!" However, Evidence 2, which is "Oh! Cult! New Year's Issue," does not mention Godot's first visit to the Inner Temple.

However, another contradiction exists between Testimony 3 and Evidence 2, which is "Oh! Cult! New Year's Issue." Testimony 3 states that Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time, but it does not mention when this first visit occurred. Evidence 2, which is "Oh! Cult! New Year's Issue," does not mention Godot's visit to the Inner Temple.

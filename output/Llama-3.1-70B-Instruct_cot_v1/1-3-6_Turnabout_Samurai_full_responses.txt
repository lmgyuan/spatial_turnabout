Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer." However, Testimony 4 states, "At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting." This suggests that Vasquez and Sal were still in the meeting at 2:30 PM, not eating steaks outside the trailer.

However, another contradiction exists between Testimony 5 and Evidence 16, which is "Steak Plate." Testimony 5 states that Vasquez and Sal ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer, but Evidence 16 states that the steak plate was found in the employee area, not outside the trailer.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 7 states, "I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind." However, Evidence 17, which is "Five-Year-Old Photo," shows an accident involving Jack Hammer that occurred five years ago, which suggests that Hammer's injury may have been an old one, not a recent one.

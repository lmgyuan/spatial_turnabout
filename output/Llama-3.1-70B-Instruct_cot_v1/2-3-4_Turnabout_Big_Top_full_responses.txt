Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body." However, Evidence 15, which is "Max G. Bust," states that the bust is rather heavy, which implies that it would require a significant amount of force to lift and drop it.

This is a direct contradiction between the two, as the testimony suggests that Acro could not have exerted the necessary force to drop the bust, while the evidence suggests that the bust is heavy and would require a significant amount of force to lift and drop.

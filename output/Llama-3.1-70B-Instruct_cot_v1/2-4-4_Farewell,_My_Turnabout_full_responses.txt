Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "Yeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!" However, Evidence 30, which is "Bellboy's Uniform," states that the uniform was worn by De Killer on the night of the murder, but it does not necessarily mean that the bellboy was the assassin.

However, another contradiction exists between Testimony 5 and Evidence 30, which states that De Killer was wearing the bellboy's uniform, but it does not mention that Powers saw De Killer coming out of Corrida's room.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 4 states, "Adrian Andrews already knew from the very beginning that Juan Corrida was dead!" However, Testimony 3 states, "While pretending to be the first person to discover the body and enter the scene," which implies that Andrews was trying to make it seem like she was the first person to discover the body, which would mean that she did not know that Corrida was dead from the beginning.

However, another contradiction exists between Testimony 4 and Evidence 18, which is "Picture Card." Testimony 4 states that Andrews already knew that Corrida was dead, but Evidence 18 states that Andrews was carrying a picture card that was placed next to the victim at the time of the murder, which implies that Andrews may have been trying to make it seem like she was the first person to discover the body.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "One of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews." However, Evidence 25, which is "Figurine," states that the figurine was found at Engarde Mansion, and Evidence 27, which is "Celeste's Suicide Note," states that the note was found inside the figurine, which implies that the figurine was already in the possession of Andrews or Engarde.

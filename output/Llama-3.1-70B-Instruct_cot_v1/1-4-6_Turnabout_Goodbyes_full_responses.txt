Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream." However, Evidence 18, which is "DL-6 Case File," states that the murder weapon was fired twice.

This is a direct contradiction between the two, as the testimony suggests that there was only one gunshot, while the evidence suggests that the murder weapon was fired twice.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 5}

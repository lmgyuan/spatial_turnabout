Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Evidence 2 is "Glass Shards," which are described as "the broken remains of a glass light stand. Broken beyond all recognition." However, Testimony 5 states, "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!" 

This suggests that the victim must have used something to write with, but Evidence 2 indicates that the only thing that could have been used to write (the glass light stand) was broken beyond all recognition. However, it does not necessarily mean it was impossible for the victim to write with it. 

However, there is another contradiction. Testimony 5 states that the victim wrote the killer's name, but Testimony 2 states that the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood, and Testimony 3 states that the blood was the victim's. This means that the victim wrote "Maya" in her own blood, but Testimony 5 states that the victim wrote the killer's name. This is a clear contradiction, as "Maya" is not necessarily the killer's name.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 1 states, "The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right." This is consistent with Evidence 9, which is "May Testimony" and states, "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." However, this also implies that the victim was moving around after the first attack.

However, Evidence 5, which is "Mia's Autopsy Report," states, "Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous." This suggests that the victim died immediately after the attack, which contradicts Testimony 1 and Evidence 9.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces." However, Evidence 4, which is "Sacred Urn," states that the Sacred Urn is "supposedly priceless, it looks like a plain old pot", which implies that the urn may not be as valuable as it seems.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 4 states, "Thirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!" However, Evidence 19, which is "Buzzer Record," states that the buzzer went off once at 1:02 AM on October 12 in the CEO's office, which implies that the police were notified immediately after the crime, not 30 minutes later.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "I put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye." However, Testimony 2 states, "Unfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless." This implies that the thief used a weapon to strike Atmey, but Testimony 5 suggests that the thief struck Atmey's third eye directly.

However, another contradiction exists between Testimony 2 and Evidence 6, which is "Shichishito." Testimony 2 states that the thief grabbed a weapon from the side, but Evidence 6 states that the Shichishito was not bent before the crime, which implies that it may not have been used as a weapon.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 3 states, "I donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!" However, Testimony 0 states, "The truth is, I've been Maskâ˜†DeMasque all along!" but Evidence 14, which is "DeMasque's Broach," states that the broach was found in the shadow of Ami Fey's statue, which implies that Ron may not have been the one wearing the costume.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "So after I heard that single gunshot I went home." However, Evidence 11, which is "Lotta's Deposition," states that Lotta heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. This suggests that there were multiple gunshots, not just a single gunshot as Butz claims.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "Just when she said 'Hey! It's almost Christmas!' I heard the gunshot!" This suggests that Butz heard the gunshot at the exact moment the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!", which implies that the gunshot occurred at a specific moment in time.

However, Evidence 3, which is "Autopsy Report â†’ Robert's Autopsy Report," states that the time of death was sometime on the 24th or 25th, but does not specify an exact time. This suggests that the time of death may not be as precise as Butz claims.

Gumshoe: Every year in March, we have a training camp for us cops. Officer Byrde was a rookie at the time, and she and Officer Prince seemed to hit it off. Phoenix: (They got close, I take it...) Gumshoe: Actually, I was supposed to go, too, but... I couldn't pay the deposit for the trip, so I didn't. If only I had gone on that trip... Judge: What is it? Gumshoe: Oh, uh, nothing, sir! Really! Anyway...Gumshoe: It sounded like they were even talking about marriage.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Marriage? But wasn't the victim 8 years older than her? Gumshoe: What!? You saying a guy's gotta marry someone the same age as himself, pal!? Phoenix: No, that's not what I meant at all... Byrde: Detective Gumshoe and Dustin were only a year apart, you know? Phoenix: (Ugh... I think this fella has a ways to go before marriage...) Gumshoe: Mind your own business, pal!Gumshoe: The day of the incident just happened to be the victim's birthday, sir.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The day of the incident... You mean September 6th? Gumshoe: Yeah. The victim, Officer Prince, had just gotten off duty at 5:30 PM that day, and since Maggey's night shift hadn't started yet, they went to the park for a bit... Judge: Ah, I remember when I was young and in love. Oh, it was a jolly time. Phoenix: (That's great, Your Honor... I'm glad you're such a cheerful old man...)Gumshoe: Maggey... I mean, Officer Byrde, had gotten Officer Prince a present.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ... You seem to know a lot about the defendant. Gumshoe: Well, that's because, uh, I'm her boss. And I've gotta watch out for my subordinates! Phoenix: But even what she was going to give as a present? Isn't that going a bit too far...? Gumshoe: Hey, pal! Watch what you say! I know everything that happens under me! If someone so much as scratches their... Phoenix: I REALLY don't need to know that much... Payne: Payne: Mr. Wright! Please refrain from badgering the witness! Judge: I agree. Even if this witness has a crush on the defendant, that should not be the point of discussion at this time. Gumshoe: Whoa! Wait a second! Why are we talking about this!? It's all YOUR fault, pal! You're guilty, guilty, guilty! I should have you arrested! Phoenix: (I think the good Detective is about done here...)Gumshoe: It was something she had bought over 2 months ago. (Changed from [It was something she had gotten over 2 months ago.] in the original release)Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Over 2 months ago?\" Gumshoe: Yup. She's a very considerate woman, pal! Phoenix: So... What was this birthday present? Gumshoe: She got him a glove. Judge: A single glove? Why would she only give him one? Payne: Um, actually, Your Honor, the glove in question is a baseball glove. Judge: Oh, I see. A baseball glove. Gumshoe: Officer Prince was a huge baseball fan. Phoenix: (A baseball glove. Hmm...) Press further Phoenix: Just now, I believe you said that the present was something she had \"bought over 2 months ago\". (Changed from [she had \"gotten over 2 months ago\".] in the original release) Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: Are you saying she bought the glove at a store that far in advance? (Changed from [Are you saying she went out and bought the glove over 2 months ago?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Nah, nothing like that, pal! Phoenix: Then, what is it like? Gumshoe: She ordered it. It was custom-made! Phoenix: Custom-made? The glove was custom-made? Gumshoe: Yup, that's what I said! Judge: Hmm... So the glove was custom-made. Payne: Payne: Your Honor, I really don't see how this glove is related to this case. Judge: Yes, it would seem that there is little relevance. What do you think, Mr. Wright? Do you think this glove is really relevant to this case? Of course it's relevant Leads to: \"I don't know where this will lead me, but...\" Of course it's not Phoenix: Hmm, I suppose it isn't really relevant. Judge: Th-Then...  Then why were you wasting this court's time with irrelevant questions!? Phoenix: Uh, I was curious and got, uh, carried away, Your Honor...? Judge: Witness, please ignore this airheaded lawyer and continue with your testimony. Payne: Detective Gumshoe, please tell the court why you knew about the baseball glove. Leads back to cross-examination Leave him be Phoenix: (Well, it's just a birthday present...) Payne: If there are no further questions, Your Honor...  Judge: Hmm... Witness, why do you know about this glove? Leads back to cross-examinationGumshoe: I should know, 'cause she came to me to ask what she should get for him.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You discussed what the defendant was going to give to her boyfriend? Gumshoe: Well, I'm, er... *ahem* She, uh... trusts me, so... Phoenix: (Boy does he look proud of himself right now...)Phoenix: ...Byrde: Wh-What is it this time?Phoenix: That testimony didn't sound like it had any contradictions in it to me. There just wasn't anything that really stuck out as odd.Byrde: Yeah... I wonder what would happen if you tried to get more information from him?Phoenix: Get more information?Byrde: Yeah! You know! Like how they \"press\" people on those old cop shows, sir!Phoenix: So I should try \"pressing\" him, huh?Phoenix: (I don't know where this will lead me, but...) Of course it is relevant! That glove is the key to this whole case!Byrde: Yes! Bluffing to the max! Now, THIS is the Mr. Wright I know! I'm so happy you're back, sir! I was wondering how long it'd take! This is great!Phoenix: (Hmm, pressing people... It feels like I've done this before. As if I used to do this to squeeze information from even the most tight-lipped people.)Judge: Very well. If you are that convinced, then let's hear some more about this matter.Gumshoe: Actually, I brought the glove with me today.Phoenix: And?Judge: Why didn't you say so earlier? Hurry and show the glove to this court!Gumshoe: Well, I didn't think it had anything to do with this case... Anyway, this is it, sir.Judge: It's, uh... rather yellow, isn't it?Baseball Glove added to the Court Record.Gumshoe: Officer Prince really liked the color yellow.Phoenix: And that's why you had to special order it?Byrde: Yup, that's right! That, and one other reason...Judge: I think this court has heard enough. It is clear that the victim and the defendant were involved with each other.Payne: Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.Judge: Now, if that is true, it brings up an important question. Was the name \"Maggie\" really written by the victim?Payne: I see your point, Your Honor. Detective Gumshoe, please tell the court a little more about the name on the ground.Gumshoe: Yes, sir.Witness Testimony-- Writing on the Ground --Gumshoe: We first looked into the handwriting. (Changed from [We first looked into the handwriting, sir.] in the original release) Unfortunately, we couldn't confirm that it was the victim's handwriting. Next, we checked the victim's pointer finger. We found out that there was sand trapped under the victim's fingernail. There were also scratches on the skin that were caused by him writing on the ground. From this, we could confirm that the victim wrote this name with his right hand.Judge: Hmm... Yes, a perfectly logical conclusion. Now then, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix: Thank you, Your Honor.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Writing on the Ground --Gumshoe: We first looked into the handwriting.Press Phoenix:   Phoenix: But can you really determine handwriting based on a sample written in sand?  Gumshoe: Heh, this is why amateurs are amateurs. We're not a buncha simpletons, pal! Scientific investigation in this country's actually pretty good.  Judge: Hmm, I believe it's time to get back to the real point.  Payne: Agreed, Your Honor. So, what was the result of the investigation?Gumshoe: Unfortunately, we couldn't confirm that it was the victim's handwriting.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So in the end, you couldn't confirm it?  Gumshoe: Hey, don't you look down on us! I told you! We're not a bunch of simpletons, pal! Everyone knows you can't find out everything you want with scientific investigation!  Judge: I've never heard that before.  Payne: Me, either.  Phoenix: Nor I.  Byrde: I never heard anything like that at the police academy, sir...  Gumshoe: OK, so I made it up. Anyway...Gumshoe: Next, we checked the victim's pointer finger.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: His pointer finger?  Gumshoe: You know, the one you're always POINTING and waving around in people's faces.  Phoenix: Aha, ha, ha. Don't tell me it bothers you...  Gumshoe: Every time you do it, I have a mini-heart attack. It's like you're trying to kill me, pal.  Payne: In any case, you examined the victim's index finger, correct?  Gumshoe: Yeah. We figured there should be something on his finger if he had been writing in sand.  Judge: Hmm... And the results?Gumshoe: We found that there was sand trapped under the victim's fingernail.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And what does that prove? Gumshoe: Well, it proves that he did write that name with his own finger. Payne: Yes, which explains why there was sand stuck under his nail. Phoenix: (I guess he's right...) Gumshoe: And there's more...Gumshoe: There were also scratches on the skin that were caused by him writing on the ground.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Scratches on his skin?\" Gumshoe: Yup. You can't see them with your naked eye, but they're there.  Judge: That is incredible!  Gumshoe: Sure is! That's the power of scientific investigation! They're so small that we had to use a magnifying glass... like a really strong one. It's got that really scientific-sounding name...  Phoenix: You mean a microscope?  Gumshoe: Yeah, that's it! We used one of those and that's how we found them!  Phoenix: (I can't believe this guy doesn't know what a microscope is...)Gumshoe: From this, we could confirm that the victim wrote this name with his right hand.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely sure? Gumshoe: I believe in the power of science. Phoenix: (Hmm, I wonder if my evidence is solid enough to counter with?)Present Baseball Glove Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe. Take a look at this.\"Phoenix: (Listening to this, you would think there was only one conclusion... that the name was definitely written by the victim...)Byrde: But don't you think that would be really strange, sir!? If Dustin really wrote that message with his right hand, do you think I would have gone through that much trouble to get him his present?Phoenix: (The present...?

And that's about it.Phoenix: Yes, it's REALLY yellow, but that is only one of its qualities.Gumshoe: Huh?Phoenix: There's another reason why it's special.Judge: And what would that be?Phoenix: It's very simple. This glove is made for a left-handed person!Gumshoe: Left-handed...?Judge: Why, you're absolutely right! This glove is made to be worn on the right hand!Phoenix: That is why it had to be custom-made. I have never seen a bright yellow left-hander's glove for sale. Have you?Gumshoe: Well, um... no.Phoenix: So, Detective. Which hand did the victim use to write the name with, again...?Gumshoe: That's easy! Look, it's obvious from this picture that it was his... W-W-Wait a sec...Phoenix: Don't forget that the victim was left-handed!Gumshoe: Aaaaah!!Payne:Payne: This is... This is... I mean... I... Objec--Judge: Overruled. Mr. Wright, I would like to know what your line of reasoning proves.Phoenix: There is only one conclusion that can be drawn! A left-handed person could not have written a message with his right hand! Therefore! The person who wrote the name \"Maggie\" could not have been the victim!Judge: Order! Order! When you think about it that way, then yes, it is not possible that this name was written by the victim himself.Gumshoe: Then that means Maggey is...!Payne: No... IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!!Judge: Mr. Payne.Payne: Y-Y-Yes, Your Honor?Judge: The evidence the prosecution has presented has failed to prove the defendant's guilt. In fact, I believe you have proven her to be innocent!Payne: NOOOOOOO!Byrde: Alright! You did it, Mr. Wright! Whew! I feel like I can breathe again!Judge: It seems that we have reached the conclusion. You did a fine job once again, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: Me, Your Honor? Ah, well, thank you, sir...Byrde: See, you got complimented by the judge again! You're really good! And that's why you can't give up being a lawyer, sir!Phoenix: (Are you joking!? I'm more than ready to retire!)Judge: I will now announce my verdict. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde...Payne:Payne: No!! Not yet! I mean, please give me a few more minutes, Your Honor.Judge: Wh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Payne!?Payne: The prosecution is not finished yet!Phoenix: What do you mean!?Payne: We would like to call our next witness to the stand!Phoenix: Whaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge: And what did this witness... witness?Payne: The moment the victim was pushed to his death! What's more, he saw the very face of the culprit!Phoenix: What the heck!?Judge: Order! Order in the court! I believe a recess is in order. Afterward, we will hear from this new witness.Phoenix: (I had a feeling that was a bit too easy... Hmm, I need more information. I'll have to see what I can find out during this recess. I can't let my guard down! It's only going to get tougher from here!)Judge: Court is adjourned for recess!To be continued.September 8, 11:43 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Byrde: A-Amnesia!? I can't believe my lawyer's trying to defend me in such a state...Phoenix: ... I... Uh...Byrde: Why didn't you tell me, sir!?Phoenix: I'm sorry I didn't mention it to you.Byrde: Oh! I know what to do! I heard you can fix something like this with a really strong shock to your system! Come on, lower your head a little! A Maggey Kick should be all you need!Phoenix: Ah, no, no, no. I think I'll pass on this one.Byrde: Come on! ... I-I'm sorry. (Changed from [Come on! ... Ah, I'm sorry.] in the original release) Whenever I see someone in trouble, I have a hard time leaving them alone... I tend to stick my nose where it doesn't belong and try to tackle everyone's problems.Phoenix: (Well, my head's one problem you won't be tackling today...) Well, we're here to solve your problem first. We can deal with mine later. For now, do you think you can fill me in on a few things?Byrde: Of course! I'd be honored to! Ah, well, I guess we'll start with my name and then I can tell you about me!Phoenix: No, no, that's ok. Really. I think I know you and your name pretty well by now. I was wondering if you could help me figure out a few things about myself. So, my name is \"Phoenix Wright\"? What a weird name.Byrde: Hmmmm... This is serious. You really don't remember. I'll tell you what, sir. You can have this back, and maybe it'll help!Phoenix: ...? This is... a business card?Byrde: I got this from you. It's my most prized possession! You can borrow it for now, but please give it back, OK!?Phoenix: OK. (There are some numbers written on the back...)Byrde: Oh, that's your cell phone number!Phoenix's Business Card added to the Court Record.Phoenix: I guess for now, we should stop talking about me, and start talking about this case.Byrde: This case...?Phoenix: Yup. Can you think of anything that would be helpful for me to know?Byrde: Um, what can I tell you...? Ah, um... Hmm... I can't think of anything other than the incident with that cell phone, but...Phoenix: ...Cell phone?Byrde: Yeah! Your eyes lit up when we talked about it at the Detention Center, sir!Phoenix: ...! Hurry up then and tell me! This might be very important!Byrde: OK! Roger! It was on the day of the crime, just before 6 PM... I picked up a lost cell phone while on a walk with Dustin.Phone: ...............Byrde: All of a sudden, the phone began to ring...Phone: ...*beep*...Byrde: \"Um, hello?\"???: \"Oh, thank you! I've been searching for my phone.\"Byrde: \"Is this yours? Oh, I'm glad you called! We can meet up and I can give this back!\"???: \"I'll be right there, um... I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name...\"Byrde: \"You can call me Maggey!\"Byrde: We agreed to meet up at 6 PM. Dustin and I waited for the person to show up... but they never did.Phoenix: Hmmmm... So where is the phone you found now?Byrde: I gave it to you yesterday!Phoenix: Huh? To me? (Is it that phone in my pocket...?) Y-You mean this?Byrde: Do you think it has anything to do with the murder?Phoenix: I... don't really know... But if my eyes \"lit up\"...???: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!! YOU WERE HERE ALL ALONG!! You're so mean!! I called you a million times but you wouldn't pick up! And when I went to check in the courtroom, everyone had already left...Phoenix: (Ack! Now who in the heck is this? Let me guess. I'm supposed to know this girl too...)???: Hey, good morning, Maggey!Byrde: And a good morning to you, too, Maya!Maya: So!? So!? How's it going!?Byrde: Is there a word for \"worse than abysmal\"...?Maya: Oh? And what if I said that everything will be fine? That's right! It's Maya to the rescue with the ultra-decisive super-important evidence! Here you are, Nick! The thing you wanted me to bring!Phoenix: Huh? Oh, ah, thanks... (What the heck is this? A list? It has about 20 people's names and phone numbers written on it.)Maya: It was kind of tough, but I managed to dig up some dirt! (Changed from [It was kind of tough, but I managed to find out some dirt!] in the original release) It looks like these guys are up to no good.Phoenix: \"No good\"? As in?Maya: There's a group of con artists the police are currently investigating. I think these guys are members of that group.Names List added to the Court Record.Phoenix: Why would a group of con artists pop up in a case like this?Maya: Don't look at me!Phoenix: Hmm... And where did you get this list from in the first place?Maya: Whaaaaat!? Don't you remember, Nick!? (Changed from [Whaaaaat!? Why are you asking that!?] in the original release) You're the one who asked me to look this up yesterday!Phoenix: Oh... is that right?Maya: These numbers were in the memory of that phone Maggey found.Phoenix: Hmm, so that's where they're from.Maya: You're awfully forgetful these days, Nick. I hope I never get to be a forgetful old prune like you!Byrde: Um, Maya... Actually, Mr. Wright is...Bailiff: Mr. Wright! Recess is now over. Please bring the defendant and return to the courtroom immediately!Maya: Oh, oops! Guess you have to get going! We can talk about you being old later, Nick!Byrde: W-Wish us luck!Phoenix: (I guess I have all the pieces now... More or less. All that's left is to put it all together. I'm not going to lose this. I can't!)Maya: Come on, Nick. Better get a move on!Phoenix: Y-Yeah.September 8, 11:54 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge: The court will now reconvene. Please call your next witness to the stand, Mr. Payne.Payne: Yes, Your Honor. But before I do, if I may say a few words...Judge: What is it, Mr. Payne?Payne: It's about the next witness. He has a tendency to say things that rub people the wrong way, you see, so I ask that the court might be a little lenient on...Judge: There is no need to give a preface. Just hurry up and call your witness, please.Payne: Y-Yes, Your Honor. ...The prosecution calls its next witness: a drifter who was taking a walk in the park on the day of the murder!Payne: Please state your name for the court, witness.???: Before I do, I'd like to clarify a little something.Payne: Huh? Oh, alright, go ahead.???: Just now, you introduced my wonderful self to the court, correct? Perhaps as a \"drifter who was taking a walk\"?Payne: D-Did I????: But I will not stand for that! Now you've tinted the court's eyes and colored me wrongly. Sure, I suppose calling me a university student would not be the absolute truth, but to give in and just settle would be as evil as death and I can't have that! Everything in my life is to be of the utmost, highest, top grade quality, you understand. I am merely looking for that perfect, top notch, unbeatable university, don't you see...? I have a rigorous selection process and I was in serious thought during my \"walk\" as...Payne: Yes, yes, I understand. I'm very sorry. I will be more careful from now on.Maya: Wh-What is he? A human chatterbox?Phoenix: Ugh... I have to question HIM????: Fashion! Cars! Women! Glasses! And of course, University! First-rates only need apply!Phoenix: (Glasses...? But you aren't wearing glasses...)Judge: That's enough! Your name, witness.???: Oh? Is that how you want to play this? Using your power and influence to keep the young people down. I see how you work now. You old people and your dirty tricks. You thought you had me, but you thought wrong.Judge: I-I'm sorry. It won't happen again.Phoenix: (Oh man...)Wellington: I forgive you. Alright, I suppose I can tell you my name. I am Richard Wellington, the \"Drifting Virtuoso\" with a Ph.D. in Drifting, as it were. If you wanted to, you could call me a \"University Student in Transit\".Payne: Ahem, Mr. Wellington. On the day of the murder, you were taking a... er, strolling through the park, correct?Wellington: It would appear that you are attached to that word. If you must, then by all means. But I remind you that I am in no way a prepubescent boy, \"out on a walk\" with mommy. If you must know, I am--Payne: Anyway! Please testify to this court what you saw during your walk through the park!Wellington: See, you said it again! \"Taking a walk\"... You know, you--Judge: What you witnessed will do, Mr. Wellington!Witness Testimony-- What I Saw That Day --Wellington: I was at the park all afternoon, deep in thought about my life situation. I don't remember the time all that well, but I do believe it was past 6 PM. All of a sudden, a police officer falls from above, right in front of my eyes. Without a thought, I looked up, and there I met the eyes of a charming, young lady. Of course I remember her sweet face. It was that of the pretty defendant there. The only other thing I saw was the banana that fell with the police officer.Judge: Hmm, that was certainly a decisive testimony.Maya: Decisive!? Nick, did you hear what he just said!?Phoenix: Yeah.Maya: That's all you have to say? How can you be so calm!?Phoenix: (It's strange... My mind is very calm and clear.) Maybe it's because I... believe in my client.Maya: You mean Maggey?Phoenix: Yes. And if she really is innocent, then that can only mean one thing: That guy is lying!Judge: You may now question the witness, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: (I'll find out the truth, no matter how well you craft your lies!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What I Saw That Day --Wellington: I was at the park all afternoon, deep in thought about my life situation.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you were at the park all afternoon? You seem to have a lot of free time.  Wellington: Hmph. That was very rude of you. But then again, what can I expect? That's what you get from a man who graduated from a no-name, trashy university.  Phoenix: N-No name? Trashy...?  Wellington: Now, this might be hard for a mush-headed, feeble-minded baboon like you, but I have to think very carefully about the future of our great country.  Phoenix: But I thought you said you were thinking about which college to go to just now...  Wellington: Oh, puh-leaze. Which university I go to will directly affect the very future of this country!  Phoenix: (That arrogant little snot...)Wellington: I don't remember the time all that well, but I do believe it was past 6 PM.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How did you know what time it was? I see you're not wearing a watch, so...  Wellington: Is that the best you can do? Do you think you can discredit me like that? You're just a third-rate, biased fool. I guess I can't expect real smarts from you.  Phoenix: (Grr... His arrogance is really intolerable... So, what should I do now...?) Press harder Phoenix: Answer the question! How did you know what time it was!? Wellington: Tsk, tsk. I can't believe I have to deal with a worm like you. You're just a shallow man who can only slam on desks and point at people for fun. Hmph, I guess I don't have a choice. I'll try to explain it so that even a third-rate simpleton like you can understand. There was this little thing they call a \"clock\" at the park. Did you get that? Do you know what a clock is? It's a thing that tells you the time. Payne: As you can see, Mr. Wright, it's even in this picture of the crime scene. Phoenix: (Oh... So it is... Urk.) Wellington: I looked at that clock, and that's how I knew the time. But if you ask me, this whole concept of breaking time apart into fragments... It's total and utter nonsense that no man should follow. A real first-class person doesn't live by, nor is he chained by, time. And to wear a watch? Hah! What a ridiculous notion! People should live freely without constraints. That's how life should be! Phoenix: (And yet again, another flood of meaningless words... Talk about a first-class waste of time...) Wellington: In any case... Leads back to cross-examination Leave him be Phoenix: (Well, I guess there's no point in pressing him further. After all, there was a clock right there at the crime scene...) Leads back to cross-examinationWellington: All of a sudden, a police officer falls from above, right in front of my eyes.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And how did you know he was a police officer? Wellington: You obviously have no idea how powerful my deductive reasoning skills are. With one glance, I could tell just what kind of occupation he held. That shoddy, do-it-yourself hairstyle practically screamed \"I'm a police officer\". It was also the way he tied his tie and those cheap, low-quality shoes. Ugh. Oh, and I suppose it was also because he was wearing an officer's uniform. Phoenix: (Shouldn't that statement have come first!?) Maya: Wow, that's pretty impressive. Hey, Nick! Do you think he's figured out what I do? Phoenix: (Even I haven't figured that out yet...)Wellington: Without a thought, I looked up, and there I met the eyes of a charming, young lady.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure you got a good look at her face? Wellington: Animals have this thing called an \"eye\", Mr. Wright. They use this \"eye\" to see things. In the case of humans, we have two of them. Yes, even you! Phoenix: I don't care if I have them or not! Did you or did you not get a clear look at her face!? Payne: Payne: That's what the witness was just about to get to. I would like to request that Mr. Wright not use such a loud voice during questioning. Judge: Sustained. Mr. Wright, please refrain from raising your voice in this court. Phoenix: (Then please don't make me have to raise my voice.) Wellington: Are you finished? I'd like to continue, if that's alright with you.Wellington: Of course I remember her sweet face. It was that of the pretty defendant there.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you're SURE you are not mistaken? Wellington: Please. Don't confuse your pitiful, train-wreck of a life with mine. I'm what you call a famous brand-name product, while you are only a cheap imitation. There is no way someone as magnificent as myself could have made a mistake. Payne: Of course, of course. Phoenix: (Oh ho ho ho. Of course.) Judge: Did you notice anything else of interest, witness?Wellington: The only other thing I saw was the banana that fell with the police officer.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The banana...? Wellington: Well, it was actually more than just one. More like a bunch of bananas. Phoenix: Now what would a bunch of bananas be doing there...? Wellington: And why would I know such a thing? I'm only telling you what I saw. Maya: That's really strange. Maggey never mentioned anything about a bunch of bananas. That's it, Nick! He's gotta be lying about the bananas! Phoenix: (Hmm... He could be, but... there's no reason for him to lie about there being bananas at the crime scene.) And what if it's not a lie? Maya: Well, maybe he thought he was seeing one thing, and it was something else...? Phoenix: (If he mistook something else for a bunch of bananas, then that would be an inaccuracy. Think Phoenix, think!)Present Baseball Glove Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Wellington.\"Phoenix: (If my client is innocent, there is no way he could've seen what he says he did.)Maya: Which means if we can somehow show he's lying...Phoenix: Yeah, that's exactly what we need do.

Were you wearing your glasses then?Wellington: ...!Phoenix: How about it, witness!?Wellington: Y-You are an unrelenting, evil man. You're like those people who rejected Joan of Arc and put her to death! She was brave and courageous, only to be caught by horrible, unrighteous people. And while she didn't do anything wrong, she was still gruesomely burned at the--Phoenix: Which boils down to you were not wearing your glasses at that time! Therefore! The identity of the \"woman\" at the scene of the crime and that of the defendant cannot be proven to be the same by this witness!Wellington: ...!Payne:Payne: But the height difference was only 9 feet!

They must have a lot of free time on their hands since they showed up within 10 minutes.Judge: Hmm...

Payne: Payne: The witness has already answered that question. He has stated that the defendant is the culprit! Judge: This is true. Mr. Wright, I'm striking your question from the record.

Wellington: As in immediately! I mean, sure, a minute might have elapsed before I did, but... That's the duty of every good citizen, or did they not teach that at your pitiful school?

I graduated from a pretty good, I mean, top-ranked college! Phoenix: (I don't believe this.) Wellington: It doesn't matter. I don't believe I was mistaken on what time I called. And if I am wrong, then that detective obviously doesn't know how to tell time. Gumshoe: What!? Why you!!! You're just some lousy kid who... Payne: I think the court can see your point. Anyway, how did the police respond?Present Dustin's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Wellington, would you please take a look at this?\"Wellington: They must have a lot of free time on their hands since they showed up within 10 minutes.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you're saying that there were police on the scene by 7:00 PM? Wellington: They got there before that, I think. There usually aren't many people in that area at that time of day. But suddenly, before I knew it, there were people crawling all over gawking. It certainly says something about the morals of the people in this country.Phoenix: (I can't find anything out of the ordinary in his testimony...)Maya: Why don't you take one more look at the Court Record?Phoenix: Yeah, I guess I should.\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maggey Byrde\nDescription: My client.

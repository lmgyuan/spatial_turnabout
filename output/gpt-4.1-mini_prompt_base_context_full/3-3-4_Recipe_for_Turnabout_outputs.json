This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. I-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me! Judge: The evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee. No! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me? Payne: Well... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!? Judge: This court finds the defendant... Guilty Judge: The court is adjourned. January 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Ahh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world! Phoenix: I bet it does, Maya. Maya: So! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think? Phoenix: Sure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake. Maya: Never! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game. ???: HEY, PAL! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... Maya: Happy New Year, Detective! Gumshoe: Uh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA... Maya: Here's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation! Gumshoe: Um... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO... Maya: Have you got a holiday present for me, Detective? Gumshoe: A what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but... Maya: Yay! Thanks! Gumshoe: LOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT! Maya: Hey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you? Gumshoe: Ah... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose? Maya: Ha ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year? Gumshoe: Very funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this! Phoenix: What is it? A magazine? Maya: Hey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\" Phoenix: Tr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!? Gumshoe: It's a report, pal. About you! Maya: Listen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\" Gumshoe: WELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it! Phoenix: But I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway? Gumshoe: Umm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month. Maya: Which makes it old news, you mean. Phoenix: But I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December! Maya: Hmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick? Gumshoe: If it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility... Maya: No way. You don't mean... Phoenix: A pho... Maya: A phony Nick!? Phoenix: (This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...) Magazine Clipping added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: SO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!? Phoenix: What do you mean, what am I going to do about it? Maya: Well, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case! Phoenix: My fault!? How do you figure that? Maya: Because THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of... Gumshoe: Yeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves? Phoenix: (But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...) Gumshoe: You better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it? Maya: Sounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto! Phoenix: I don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned. Maya: ... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year. Gumshoe: So you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!? Phoenix: (I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least pretend to read them once in a while. Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's sort of a keepsake... something to remember Mia by. Sure, the office is a mess, but I never forget to water this little fella. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so it's still super neat and tidy from when Pearls cleaned it. Movie poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I have to check it out one of these days. Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they bought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called \"Gatewater Land\". ...I wonder if that bellboy is going to send me a greeting card this year, too? Talk What to do Maya: So, what's our first move? Phoenix: I guess we go down to the detention center and talk-- Maya: Wait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right? Phoenix: Hey, hey! Let's get one thing straight. It wasn't me, it was a fake me that did this! Maya: Hmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean. Phoenix: (I hope not. *shudder* ...And what kind of name for an evil double is Xin Eohp anyway!?) Maya: Ah! Nick! I've got it! Phoenix: If you're going to ask whether I've got a twin brother, the answer is no. Maya: ...Spoilsport. Any ideas Maya: Did you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me? Phoenix: What do you mean? Maya: I mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess he was acting kind of strange. Maya: Maybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick! Phoenix: ... Considering how we interact, I seriously doubt that, Maya... Maya: Well, if he wasn't nervous because of you... Phoenix: ...then maybe it's because of our new guilty client? Present Attorney's Badge Maya: So you've still got that badge, I see. Phoenix: Huh!? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I? Maya: Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job. Phoenix: (...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.) Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe you've got an impersonator. Phoenix: I can't either. *sigh* Maya: Aww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people impersonating them! Phoenix: This isn't funny, Maya. It's not just an impersonation. This guy stole my identity! And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result. Maya: ...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick? Phoenix: (...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day. Phoenix: ...That's called \"taking a shower\". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it's because Maya's at a loss these days...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia helped me out in court again last time. Maya: It's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that. Phoenix: Yeah... Maya: We mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis... Phoenix: ...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don't we just have Pearls call her? Maya: No... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her. Phoenix: (I guess Maya's got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.) Godot profile Maya: So you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh? Phoenix: I already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much. Maya: Well he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter. Phoenix: You're just making that up, Maya! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: Digging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it? Phoenix: No. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him. Maya: Yeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears! Phoenix: (Did you mean he \"gets paid dirt\" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?) Any other evidence Phoenix: Do you know anything about this, Maya? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) Any other profile Phoenix: Do you know anything about this person? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everyone, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this individual. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: It's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick? Phoenix: Looks like Gumshoe isn't around. Maya: He's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work! Phoenix: No, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case. Maya: Guess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh? Phoenix: After being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Don't die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!\" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that's the key. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Desks Phoenix: These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks. Poster Phoenix: A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT! Mask☆DeMasque turned up at the bank? What's he doing!? \"Hands up, you scalawags!\" \"You're under arrest!\" Hey! That's our job! Phoenix: (Looks like Ron DeLite's opted for a new career.) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\", right Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Umm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: This is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...? Phoenix: K-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me! ???: Aaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying. Phoenix: A-Aren't... you... ???: Yes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down! Maya: Aah! You're... Are you...? ??? Don't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Maggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt-- Byrde: Oh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!? Maya: You better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick. Byrde: O-Oh... I see... Phoenix: So that's where we stand right now. Maya: I'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder... Byrde: My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures. Phoenix: (I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...) Byrde: But I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir! Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. I bet they don't get too many waitresses in here. He looks like he's getting a bit restless. Talk Maggey Byrde Maya: So, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform. Byrde: Hmph. I was fired after that... incident last year. Maya: Oh. I'm sorry. Byrde: It's OK. I don't mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on. Maya: So, what do you do now? Byrde: In the second act of \"The Life of Maggey Byrde\", I'm playing the role of a waitress! Maya: A waitress!? Byrde: Yes. In a French restaurant. It's a small place, but it's quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir. Phoenix: And then you got into this mess straight away, right? Byrde: Yeah, you could put it that way... What happened Byrde: This whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Trés Bien. Maya: \"Treh Bee-an\"...? Byrde: Yes. It's a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included! Maya: Oh... Byrde: There were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim's cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out. Maya: Hey, hold on there, Maggey. Byrde: What? Maya: You keep calling the guy, \"the victim\". Didn't you know the guy who was killed? Byrde: Not at all! I'd never even seen the guy before! Maya: Oh... Phoenix: (So she wouldn't have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right? Byrde: Of course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele. Phoenix: So, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come? Byrde: ......... You tell me, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ack! (Guess the answer to my question is \"my phony\"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.) Guilty verdict (appears after \"What happened\") Maya: So, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted? Byrde: Because no one else saw. Maya: Saw what? Byrde: The other man. The one who put the poison in the victim's coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. \"The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time.\" Phoenix: But how's that possible? Byrde: I don't know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could've done a better job! Phoenix: Look! That wasn't me, OK? Byrde: And then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket. Maya: What? Byrde: A small bottle... of poison. Maya: WHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!? Byrde: Well, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must've slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious. Phoenix: And no one else saw this other guy? Byrde: No, sir. That's what everyone said. But I don't see how they could've missed him... The other guy (appears after \"Guilty verdict\") Byrde: I was the one who took the coffee to the two men. Phoenix: O-Oh...? And what was your impression of them? Byrde: Well... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry. Maya: In music? How come? Byrde: Well, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician's look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Maya: An earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all? Byrde: It had a band's name written on it. I think it was \"MC\"-something. They must've been preparing for their debut, I guess. Phoenix: So it was a band's CD. Maybe a promo disc? Maya: Maybe it was \"MC Screwdriver\"! Phoenix: Get serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that? Byrde: Nngh... What was the name of that group again...? \"MC Hacksaw...\"? No... \"MC...\" Maya: And what about the killer? What did he look like? Byrde: Well, I, um... I don't really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really. Present Attorney's Badge Byrde: That badge! Is it real? Phoenix: Of course it's real! Byrde: That's what they all say. But I've been duped before. Give it to me for a sec! Phoenix: Ah...! ...*chomp!* Maya: She... She bit into it... Byrde: And I left a few teeth marks, too! Phoenix: I can see that... Byrde: I just wish I could remember if that means it's real or a fake. Phoenix: *sigh* (I said it was real!) Magazine Clipping Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I need to ask you about this... Byrde: Hey! This article's about my case! Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me? Byrde: Yes, sir! It was the morning after I'd been arrested... I met you in the visitor's room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits. Phoenix: Me? Byrde: Yes, you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Argh... Maya: Hey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too? Byrde: No. I don't remember a phony you, Maya. Maya: Oh... *sigh* It would've been so cool... Byrde: Then you got really worked up and passionate. \"I'm gonna get you' cleared'a dis crime!\" you said. (Changed from ['I'm gonna get you cleared of this crime!' you said.] in the original release) Phoenix: OK, I get the picture. But you've met me in person before... So how come you didn't realize that guy wasn't the real me? Byrde: ... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange... Phoenix: Only a little? Byrde: Well, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And... Phoenix: So the guy was nothing like me, then!? Byrde: But he had your spiky hair and blue suit. Phoenix: (... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?) Maya: How about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter? Byrde: Everyone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir. Maya: This case just keeps getting weirder and weirder... Maya Fey profile Byrde: Thanks for your help last year! Maya: Aw, it was nothing. I'm glad we got you off the hook. Byrde: I hope you can help me out this year, too! Maya: Yeah, me too. It's be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned. Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Oh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force! Phoenix: Have you seen him recently? Byrde: No. He's never been to the restaurant. Maya: Guess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all. Byrde: Yeah, he prefers the simple things in life. Phoenix: (...Or he's just simply too poor to afford anything else.) Maggey Byrde profile Byrde: No matter what happens, I never let anything get me down! Maya: You're always so positive, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! The early Byrde catches the worm! A Byrde in the hand! Maya: Wow! All those phrases are named after you? Byrde: And I never turn my back on anything! Maya: You're always so strong, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! I'm a tough old Byrde! Maya: \"Tough old byrde\", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it? Phoenix: ...Yeah, I get it. Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be on the police force, sir. But I'm incarcerated, now. So I can't use my connections to help you. All I can tell you about now is info about ex-cons or the clientele of Trés Bien, sir... Maya: Aww, don't let it get you down, Maggey! After clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping: Byrde: Mr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial? Phoenix: Probably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial. Byrde: Um... Mr. Wright...? Phoenix: ? Byrde: Do you think we'll win next time? ...Sir? Phoenix: ...! Byrde: My life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck! Maya: Argh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this! Phoenix: Wh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!) Maya: We'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you! Byrde: Thank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then! Phoenix: Trés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place. Byrde: Yes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi! Maya: Sure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food! January 6Trés Bien Maya: Wow! Look at this place. Phoenix: \"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right? Maya: Actually, I'm not all that into it... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here. Phoenix: Don't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here! Maya: Perfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want! Phoenix: (Yeah, I suppose we can...) Examine Cash register Maya: Look, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money. Phoenix: You know, you're the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way! Trinkets Maya: Look at all the little trinkets tucked away in here. Phoenix: I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let's see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups! Maya: ... I never knew you were so... cultured. Phoenix: Come on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much! Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? It'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then. Phoenix: Hm? There's something stuffed in behind the rack. Maya: ...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. \"MC Bomber\", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe? Phoenix: I wonder what \"MC Bomber\" is supposed to be...? ! (This paper! It's from December 3rd...) This paper's from the day of the poisoning! Maya: WHAT!? Sports Paper added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...) Magazine rack (subsequent times) Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Looks like Mr. Armstrong doesn't get any newspapers. Maya: Well, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it? Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" like in these mags, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Phoenix: (We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I'd better try to find out everything I can about it...) Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: What do you think this flower is, Nick? Phoenix: Let's see... Well, it doesn't look like a tulip, and it's not a sunflower, I don't think... Maya: Duh. Even I could've told you that. Phoenix: Well, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I'm a lawyer, not a botanist! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got you! I was only kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Crime scene Phoenix: This must be the table where the murder occurred. Maya: I guess so, with all this police tape all around it. Phoenix: And that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don't go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya? Maya: Why would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know! Phoenix: (Then why can I picture you doing just that?) Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Sports Paper Maya: Hmm... \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: There's something about that name, \"MC Bomber\". Phoenix: Yeah, It's a pretty unusual name. Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: Everyone's worried about bombs these days, I guess. Phoenix: I'm not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...) Maya: Anyway, we should really look into this some more! Maggey Byrde profile Maya: This is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then. Maya: Wasn't she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We're gonna get her off the hook or I'll give up hamburgers! Detention Center Present Sports Paper Byrde: Oh! A sports paper. Let's see, let's see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title? Phoenix: Sorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It's from the day of the murder... Maya: And Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid. Byrde: Oh, no... Phoenix: I found this paper in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Byrde: Really? That's strange... Trés Bien doesn't get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he's not really fond of them. Maya: Then maybe one of the customers left it behind? Phoenix: Anyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here. Byrde: Ah-ha! That's it, sir! \"MC Bomber\"! That was the name that was written on the CD! Phoenix: (Just as I thought...) Maya: I guess it wasn't \"MC Screwdriver\" after all, huh... Byrde: So, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right? Maya: If someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! \"The Master of Kurain\" or \"The Spirit Song\" or even \"Maya's Theme\"! Phoenix: Um, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim's table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim! Maya: You're right! Phoenix: (So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...) Maya: I think we better step up the investigation, don't you Nick? After presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 6Trés Bien ???: Oh là là! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Trés Bien! Maya: Oh! Hel... lo... ... Phoenix: (What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...) ???: Bienvenue! Welcome to my petite restauranté! Maya: Huh? \"Bee Avenue\"? ???: Oh, non, my petite chulip! Maya: Huh? Me? ???: Look at z'is face! Like la kitten rejected by its own mother. You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil mélange of la néroli and la rose. My personal recommendation! Maya: You think I need what...? ???: Oui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voilá! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique! Maya: Really? ???: And for la monsieur! Phoenix: Who? Me? ???: Look at z'at face! Like la puppy rejected by life itself! You are fatigued, non? For you, monsieur, I recommend z'is! Oil of bergamot. And maybe a 'int of... Oui, oui! I will add la peppermint and la clary sage for a fragrance exceptionnel! Such an invigorating recipe will bring out your delicious beauty, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My beauty!? ???: Alors. If you will be seated, I will bring you la special menu of z'e day! Phoenix: Actually, we're not here to eat. We're lawyers. ???: Mais bien sûr! I know z'is already, monsieur. You are la Phoenix Wright, non? Phoenix: Um, yes... You know me? ???: Mais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court! Maya: I guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp... Phoenix: It looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already. Maya: I wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you? Armstrong: Allow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté! Talk Trés Bien Maya: So what does \"Trés Bien\" mean? I know \"trés\". That means \"three\", right? Armstrong: Non, non, non! \"Trés Bien\" is Français! In English, you would say, \"Very Good\". Maya: Oh. Very good... Armstrong: Oui, exactement! La atmosphere is trés bien, and la cuisine is trés bien! Phoenix: (If the food's good, why aren't there any customers in here?) Armstrong: My cuisine is not for all. Some people, z'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine. Phoenix: (I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...) Armstrong: Since I 'ave lost Maggey, I do not 'ave enough 'ands. Phoenix: So, you're running this place on your own now? Armstrong: Oui. For la moment. No one 'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi! Phoenix: (... Please don't eyeball me while you say that.) Armstrong: I am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist. Maya: A roaming what? Armstrong: A practitioner d'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z'e delicate floral aromas. Phoenix: (Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...) What happened Phoenix: So, could you tell me what you know about the incident? Armstrong: Bien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z'an a month 'as passed since it 'appened. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess it's been about a month since Maggey's sentencing...) Armstrong: So. It was z'e third of last month. Just after one in z'e afternoon. A man who was in 'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill. Phoenix: Because of the poison in his coffee? Armstrong: Z'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took 'is drink to 'im. I was in la kitchen. I 'eard z'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, 'e was already slumped in 'is chair. Maya: He was dead? Armstrong: Mon dieu! Oui! 'E was dead! Maggey 'ad passed out also. Phoenix: And this man who died... Was he alone? Armstrong: Oui, monsieur. All alone. I know z'at Maggey said z'ere was someone else, but... Maya: I see... Armstrong: La police, z'ey asked me many times. \"Are you sure z'ere was no one else at z'e table?\" z'ey asked. But I am not z'e only one. La old man said z'e same thing. Phoenix: Old man? What old man? Old man (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Um... So who is the old man that you mentioned? Armstrong: At z'e time of la murder, z'ere was another customer in 'ere. Maya: What!? Someone else saw it? Armstrong: Mais, oui! As usual, 'e came alone z'at day. At z'e time of la murder, 'e was 'ere. 'E saw it, too. But 'e said z'e same thing, z'at z'ere was no one else at la victim's table. Maya: But Maggey swears there were two people! Armstrong: Mais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, 'e could not prove z'is, non? Phoenix: About the lawyer. That was me, I suppose? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr! Phoenix: ... Wow! He's the first person who's said it wasn't me. Maya: Don't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!? Maggey's motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile) Phoenix: When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen? Armstrong: Ou... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so. Phoenix: So what happened? Armstrong: Non. It was, er... It was nothing. Maya: Look, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive! Armstrong: Oui. It is true. Phoenix: If there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant. Maya: So please! Tell us anything you know. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock!?] in the original release) Maya: No way! What are we going to do, Nick? Phoenix: We'll just have to remov... WHAT THE!? Maya: Wh-What's wrong? Phoenix: The Magatama... It's gone! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: I had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air! Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (But I could see the Psyche-Locks. (Changed from [But I could see the Psyche-Lock.] in the original release) Maybe that means the Magatama's nearby...?) Maggey's motive (subsequent times) Phoenix: Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim. 3 PSYCHE LOCKS Armstrong: N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qué será, será. Perhaps Maggey 'ad another reason. Phoenix: (What's Maggey's motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock [sic] must mean it's nearby.) Maya: I only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK? Phoenix: (...And here I thought it was mine to keep!) Present Attorney's Badge Armstrong: Please, monsieur. Z'ere is no need to show me z'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z'e worst defense lawyer in town. Phoenix: (I think I can imagine how he formed this completely wrong impression of me...) Um, the last time we met, did I show you this badge? Armstrong: Oui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant! Maya: Looks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick! Magazine Clipping Armstrong: I am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z'at day was a little, how you say, \"lacking\", per'aps? Phoenix: *sigh* Armstrong: Even a Frenchman who cannot speak any English could 'ave done a better job! You were very cool, though. Oh, oui, oui! So 'andsome. Maya: Wow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been... Armstrong: Every time you opened your mouth, z'e 'ole courthouse stirred. Phoenix: (Oh, man. That is something I don't want to imagine...) Sports Paper Phoenix: We found this sports paper in the magazine rack here. Armstrong: One of my customers must 'ave left it behind. Maya: Do you have any idea which customer it was? Armstrong: Z'e only ideas I 'ave, mademoiselle, I save for my kitchen! Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: If you want a job 'ere, it is yours, precious! Mia Fey profile Armstrong: Mon dieu! What beauty! Maya: That's my sister! Armstrong: Ah, oui? Another delight! But you 'ave a certain je ne sais quois z'at I do not sense from your sister. Maya: I do? Armstrong: So throw your head 'ead 'igh! Thrust out your feminine features! Do not lose 'eart, ma fille! You are a woman! A woman extraordinaire! Maya: Do I look like I need cheering up or something? Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Maggey was a policewoman once, n'est-ce pas? Phoenix: Yes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control. Armstrong: Oui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non? Maya: Oh... You know about that? Armstrong: Z'at is why I gave to 'er la perfume for la 'appiness. Phoenix: Happiness perfume? Armstrong: Oui. Blended from bergamot, like I 'ave given to you before. Phoenix: But she's been arrested again. And found guilty this time. Armstrong: Z'is is true. 'Er natural aroma of un'appiness must 'ave been very strong. Phoenix: (Just admit it! Your perfume doesn't work!) Armstrong: I am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z'at took place before my very eyes. Maya: Something like what? Phoenix: (What's this guy talking about!?) Maya: Does this mean... Maggey did have a motive? Phoenix: We've got to ask this guy for more info, stat! Jean Armstrong profile Armstrong: It is 'ard to imagine, I know, but I was an apprentice for five years in la gay Paris. Maya: Wow! In Paris!? Armstrong: It was something la chef z'ere said to me z'at made me decide to open my own restaurant. Phoenix: What was it? Armstrong: Z'at awful man said to me, \"You must train for another ten years!\" Oh! It was such a shock! So unexpected! But you would 'ave to be a fool to do z'is, non? Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Armstrong: Félicitations! Mais... qu'est-ce que c'est? Phoenix: Ack! Um... Je... Je no comprehend... Maya: Nick! Don't just make something up! After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there? Armstrong: ... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves. Maya: Huh? \"'Im\"? Armstrong: La old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc. Phoenix: La p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that? Armstrong: Behind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\". Maya: Thank you! Armstrong: Je vous en prie, my dear! Maya: Let's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick! January 6Vitamin Square Maya: So this is Vitamin Square. Phoenix: Yeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you. Maya: Hey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about? Phoenix: That grouchy-looking grandpa? Maya: He's throwing seeds out for the pigeons. Phoenix: Maya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them! Old Man: ... Phoenix: (Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...) Examine Sandbox Maya: I used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe! Phoenix: Really? You? Maya: Sure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do. Phoenix: Iron filings? Wow... That's too exciting for words. Maya: It was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then! Phoenix: So, did you manage to get all the iron? Maya: No, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them? Phoenix: No. Fruit attractions Maya: This place is so fruity! Phoenix: That's not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They're among my favorites. Maya: Then that apple slide is perfect for you! Phoenix: ... And what is so \"perfect\" about it? Maya: Oh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo! Phoenix: No way! I'd get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that. Maya: Yeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too. Pigeons Maya: Hey, look. Pigeons! Phoenix: Yeah. And heaps of them, too. Maya: Did you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace? Phoenix: That's a dove, not a pigeon. Maya: ... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony? Phoenix: You're over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya. Magazine on orange-themed seat Maya: Ooh, there's a magazine here. Phoenix: It's a magazine full of job listings. Old Man: You disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away! Phoenix: \"Threw away\"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job? Old Man: Kah! That's none of your business! Phoenix: Sorry! I guess I'll take the magazine with me then. Old Man: I don't want anyone else having it! Give it back! Phoenix: (Too bad. Now that you want it so bad, I don't want to give it up!) Job Listings added to the Court Record. Old Man: Hey! That's mine! Closer orange-themed seat (after examining magazine on orange-themed seat) Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: You don't have to tell me twice. Talk What you saw Phoenix: Um... Excuse me. Old Man: ... Phoenix: Would you mind if I had a word with you? Old Man: Yes! Phoenix: I just want to ask you a couple of questions... Old Man: What's the matter with you!? Can't you see I'm busy? So you don't like my seeds, eh, pigeons!? Phoenix: (He's really chucking those seeds at them! That's got to hurt!) Old Man: Go on! Eat this! Phoenix: (*sigh*) Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Maya: Yes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Kah! It's a disgrace, I tell you. An utter disgrace! Maya: A disgrace? Old Man: An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: Revealing!? You mean her uniform? Old Man: The youth of today! They don't have any shame! No shame, I tell you! Not one ounce! Whatever happened to the old bushido values of Japan, like honor and modesty? Maya: What about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing. Old Man: You!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace! Maya: Talk about hitting a girl where it hurts... Trés Bien Phoenix: Do you go to Trés Bien a lot? Old Man: Hmph! That miserable excuse for a restaurant? That garbage they serve in there's not food. Where's the sushi? The tempura? The rice!? Phoenix: Trés Bien is a French restaurant, sir... Old Man: Where do you think we are, boy? In Paris!? I want real food, not those snooty snacks! And what about those shameless girls!? Phoenix: You mean the waitresses? Old Man: You can see all the way up to their... their... Yes! The waitresses! They're practically naked! It's a disgrace, isn't it? Well, isn't it!? Phoenix: Listen, it's not my restaurant. Old Man: Kah! It's a miserable excuse for a restaurant, that place! Miserable! Phoenix: (He certainly knows the place. He must be a regular! But if he hates it so much, why does he keep going?) Trés Bien regular (appears after \"Trés Bien\") Maya: Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir? Old Man: ... Maya: It's just, if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Maya: He must be hiding something, right? Phoenix: If he is, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock... Oh, wait... I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... Maya: Remember, Nick. That Magatama is only on loan. You better find it or else! Phoenix: (If Pearls ever gets wind of this, I'm going to be in a world of pain...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, excuse me, sir. Could I just ask you about this... Old Man: ... Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: Here you go, boy! How does some pigeon feed sound to you!? Phoenix: (This wasn't exactly what I was hoping to get out of this guy...) Detention Center Present Job Listings Maya: Um, Maggey... Byrde: Oh, are you looking for some part-time work, Maya? Why don't you take a job at the restaurant? I bet Mr. Armstrong would hire you. Maya: Really? Me? Byrde: It's pretty cool being a waitress, you know. And in the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets! Maya: What secrets...? Byrde: You can't make it obvious, but just spy on him for a bit. You'll see. It's interesting. Maya: Wow! I can't wait to get my apron on now! Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Oh, so you met the owner, Mr. Armstrong! Phoenix: He's, um... Oh, how can I put this... pretty unique, huh? Byrde: He has a really intense aura. As a chef and as a person. Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Trés Bien Examine Cash register (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's really tight behind the cash register counter. Can Mr. Armstrong even get in there? And if he got in... could he get out again? Trinkets (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: There's a bunch of little trinkets on a shelf by the door. I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Magazine rack (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Ugh. All the clothes in these are absolutely atrocious! ...Some of them have been circled in red. ... I really hope Mr. Armstrong is not thinking of buying those. Table (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong must be a pretty big neat-freak. He already has this table ready to go. Now if only the food in this place was edible... Windows (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It looks pretty cold out there on the streets. Peaceful, though. It's nice that people can take it easy after the holiday rush. Crime scene (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: This must be the table where the poisoning occurred. The stain tells the story well. The whole area is still cordoned off with police tape. I guess it must still be under investigation. Present Job Listings Armstrong: Mademoiselle! Maya: Y-Yes? Armstrong: Are you looking for la job? Maya: What!? N-No, no. I was just... Armstrong: Let me see. Your style is un peu différent, but you 'ave a good face. Maya: ...Different? Armstrong: Félicitations! You 'ave passed! I will 'ire you! Bien! Come wiz me. I will teach you everyz'ing I know! Maya: N-Nick! HEEEEEELP! Phoenix: (I don't know whether to laugh or feel bad for Maya... Maybe I should do both...?) Vitamin Square Examine Sandbox Phoenix: When I think back to when I was young... ...I wonder what I found so great about playing in a sandbox. Maybe I'll come back here in the middle of the night one of these days to relive it. ... On second thought, being arrested by Gumshoe would be too embarrassing to bear. Fruit attractions Phoenix: You don't see many parks like this anymore. What a great place for kids to play. But that old man's the only one here, chucking his seeds at the pigeons. Pigeons Phoenix: The pigeons are so busy pecking at the seeds, they don't notice anything else. Seeing those birds eat with such intense focus... ...reminds me of Maya when she's scarfing down a burger. Closer orange-themed seat Phoenix: This is where I found that job listings magazine before. A guy like me carrying around a magazine like that kind of gives the wrong impression. I guess I better give it back to that old man once this investigation's over. Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Yes, you do. You know, the waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Hmph! If you ask me It's a disgrace! Th-That's what it is! An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: So, you didn't like that kind of thing, then? Old Man: ... Wh-What are you trying to say about me, boy!? Explain yourself! Phoenix: Um, nothing! I'm not saying anything about you... Old Man: I know your kind! You young ones with your spiky hair and your fancy suits! That heads of yours is over-flowing with filthy ideas! Phoenix: (...I know someone who needs to learn some stress management.) Old Man: Get out of here, you young brat! Trés Bien regular Phoenix: So, you are a regular at that restaurant, right, sir? Old Man: ... Phoenix: You're always complaining about the place, so why do you go there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Phoenix: (Something's not right about this guy... But If he's hiding something, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock.) Oh, wait... (I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... I need to find it before I can get anywhere with this old man.) After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Looks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later. Examine Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. There's nothing for him to do right now, so he's catching some vertical z's. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Poor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Trés Bien once things have cooled off. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Well, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!? Phoenix: Um, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation. Gumshoe: Well, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's really fired up about this...) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor... Phoenix: (Oh. ... Him.) Gumshoe: Now, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again... Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Gumshoe: Um... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!? Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Hitting the gas is like hitting the fast-forward button on your life.\" No. That's too obscure. You don't really get the \"you'll die before your time\" idea. I need something more direct. Something a bit more light-hearted. Something like, \"Hitting the gas is your passport to paradise!\" Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT!? Poisoned coffee waitress gets a retrial!? I knew it! I knew there was something funny about the taste of this coffee! OK! Who brought me this coffee today? Hands up! Phoenix: (Yeesh! Have a little faith in your subordinates!) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Phoenix: No matter what, whenever I come here, that mascot's there to greet me. Chief: You got that right. That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Phoenix: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're married. Phoenix: (So should I expect to see Baby Badger next time I'm here...?) Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: So the guilty party was Maggey Byrde, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah... Phoenix: Back when she was on the police force... ...you were her mentor when she was a rookie, right? Gumshoe: Yeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened. Phoenix: (Gumshoe sure is sweating up a storm over nothing... ...Ah, so that's it! Our big ol' Gumshoe has a little ol' crush on Maggey!) Gumshoe: I... I don't like her or anything! I... I was... Aaaargh! Phoenix: (Note to self: Gossip with Maya about this later!) Gumshoe: Look, pal! Don't tell anyone, OK!? You've gotta keep it a secret, got it!? Phoenix: S-Sure... And would you mind not guessing what I'm thinking all the time? Gumshoe: Hey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind. The victim Phoenix: So I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim? Gumshoe: Glen Elg, he was a computer programmer. Phoenix: I see. A programmer... Gumshoe: He was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal. Phoenix: (Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often? Gumshoe: Not according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy. Phoenix: (A programmer... and a first-time customer at that...) (Changed from [A programmer... and a first-time customer...] in the original release) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that? Gumshoe: That's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial. Phoenix: You're kidding! What was her supposed \"motive\"? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK? Phoenix: (What could this motive have been...?) The investigation Gumshoe: This isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself. Phoenix: O-Oh, that's right... Gumshoe: The judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony. Phoenix: Yeah... Doesn't sound very good for us, huh? Gumshoe: Look, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop. Phoenix: (That's not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony? Contradictions (appears after \"The investigation\") Gumshoe: The biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table. Phoenix: Yeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim. Gumshoe: Right. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD... Phoenix: (CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...) Byrde: And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Gumshoe: But our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD. Phoenix: What? Gumshoe: Not on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal. Phoenix: But didn't Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too? Gumshoe: Yeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie. Phoenix: A radio? He didn't have a CD player? Gumshoe: You got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all. Phoenix: (Come to think of it... The owner of Trés Bien didn't mention that CD either. I don't know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong's got something to hide...) The charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile) Phoenix: So what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Trés Bien? Gumshoe: It's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected with the case anyway... Phoenix: Hey, come on, Detective. Didn't you say you'd give me the dirt on anything? Gumshoe: Well, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stuff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK? Phoenix: Um... Don't suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Trés Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.) Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? (I've got to track this creep down!) Magazine Clipping Gumshoe: I wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was. Phoenix: And what did he say? Gumshoe: He started off by saying, \"I'm at a complete loss for words...\" But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour. Phoenix: But... Gumshoe: He said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty! Phoenix: (It looked like I was \"trying to get Maggey found guilty\"...?) Sports Paper Gumshoe: What's that? A sports paper? Phoenix: Yeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Gumshoe: It's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here. Phoenix: And take a look at this. See this writing here? Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... Hey! Phoenix: What is it? Gumshoe: I've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Gumshoe: Hey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble. Phoenix: (Handwriting, huh? It'd be good to know more about that, in any case...) Gumshoe: Thanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue! Sports Paper given to Detective Gumshoe. Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: Hey! So how come she's not with you today? Phoenix: She's working down at the restaurant right now. Gumshoe: Working, huh? Yeah, it's tough being broke. I would know. Phoenix: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: Next time I see her, I'll show her how to make the world's best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It's the only way! Phoenix: (Um... Why is he shaking my hand with such enthusiasm...?) Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Phoenix: What? Mia did? Gumshoe: Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Godot profile Gumshoe: That's the guy who's gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey's retrial tomorrow. Phoenix: O-Oh, really? Gumshoe: He was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal. Phoenix: (Why's that guy so determined to see me fail?) Gumshoe: You sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind. Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything. Phoenix: It's OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right. Gumshoe: ... You know what? You're not such a bad guy after all, pal. Maggey Byrde profile Phoenix: Have you gone to see Maggey? Gumshoe: Of course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words. Phoenix: Oh... Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to. Phoenix: (Did he go for her, or for himself...?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: The chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Phoenix: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day. Phoenix: Under orders? Old Man: Yeah. You know, there's something about the lady... I mean, guy. Phoenix: Huh!? You can't stop thinking about him!? Gumshoe: Not like that, pal! Gimme a break! He's not my type. I mean, I can't stop thinking that he's involved with this case somehow! Phoenix: (Sounds like he knows a little something more about our charming chef.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you make of this...? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant... Phoenix: (You don't have to explain... Really...) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.: January 6Trés Bien Phoenix: The scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...) ???: Ah! Welcome! Bee avenue! Phoenix: (Wow. What a cute voice.) Maya: Oh, it's just you, Nick. Phoenix: M-Maya! Maya: Well? How do I look? Phoenix: ... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium... Maya: Maybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer. Phoenix: (Then who was that woman I just saw?) Maya: Oh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat! Phoenix: ... I am kind of hungry, actually. Talk Waitress Phoenix: So, how do you like your new job, Maya? Maya: I never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people's orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that. Phoenix: Yeah, it's a nice-looking restaurant. It's a shame more people don't come. Maya: Don't forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my \"gimme a tip\" smile! Lunch special Maya: Hey, Nick! Why don't you order something? The chef's preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says. Phoenix: How much is it? Maya: It's the Twin-T set. So it's 20 dollars, of course. Phoenix: The Twin-T set? I believe I'll be taking a pass. It's kind of expensive. Maya: What!? But you can't! Come on, Nick! It's not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register! Phoenix: How about cleaning the toilets? That should keep you busy. Maya: Yeah, right! Maybe later. Present Anything Phoenix: About this... Maya: Sorry, Nick! I'm a waitress now. I've got a pile of work waiting for little ol' me. After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um... About the lunch... Maya: Oh! A fine choice, sir. Phoenix: No. I, um... Maya: KITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT! Phoenix: I don't need any of that! Maya: Just a moment, please, sir. Phoenix: (Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya! Maya: Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set! Phoenix: Whoa! Maya: A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit! Phoenix: Um, thanks...? Maya: Come on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already! Phoenix: (Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp! Maya: Well? Phoenix: Are you hungry, Maya? Maya: I'm starving! Phoenix: Here. It's yours. Maya: Really!? ... Urp! Phoenix: Remember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate! Maya: ... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets! Phoenix: Hey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!) Trés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record. Phoenix: How does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad? Maya: Hey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen? Phoenix: (The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.) Talk Kitchen Phoenix: Hmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? \"In the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!\" Maya: In the kitchen? Mmm. That sounds tasty! Phoenix: Hey, wait up! Maya! Maya: What is it? I'm pretty busy right now. Phoenix: Weren't you going to show me around? Maya: Tsk. There goes my plan to find some cool clue and show it off in your face... Phoenix: (I'd better conduct the search in the kitchen myself!) After clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Trés Bien: January 6Trés BienKitchen Maya: And here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually. Phoenix: ... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure. Maya: Mr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop! Examine Mirror Maya: Now THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty. Phoenix: There's a book on the dresser. \"Claurice Armstrong's Bedtime Literature\". Maya: Not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it? Phoenix: It looks like a collection of poems he's written. Maya: Poems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK? Phoenix: OK, um... Here's one. Ahem! It's called, \"Printemps\". \"Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must.\" Maya: Huh? That's it!? Phoenix: Yup. That's a poem for you. Oil bottles Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: There's one bottle that's different from all the others. Phoenix: Well what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either. Maya: And... *sniff* It doesn't smell. Phoenix: (So what's that liquid inside then, I wonder?) Maya: Hey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he? Small Bottle added to the Court Record. Oil bottles (subsequent times) Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Lace curtains Phoenix: What are these lace curtains for? Maya: I don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those. Phoenix: (How do you respond to something like that!?) Table Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter! Maya: My Magatama! What's it doing there!? Phoenix: (What indeed...) Magatama put into pocket. Table (subsequent times) Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Maya: And look at these knives. They look really sharp! Phoenix: I'd like to see how one of those slices through a cheesecake. Maya: A cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick. Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I just ate for lunch? Maya: Maybe... What you ate is the only French dish I know the name of. After examining oil bottles in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Hey, you're just in time! Phoenix: What is it, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: The lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me. Phoenix: (He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything? Gumshoe: They said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it. Phoenix: (I expected as much...) Gumshoe: The victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment. Sports Paper refiled into the Court Record. Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal? Phoenix: (Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...) Talk Armstrong's secret (appears after presenting Small Bottle) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes... Gumshoe: So, how was it? Phoenix: To put it nicely... it was inedible. Gumshoe: Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so... Phoenix: Yeah... I guess it's probably the food. Gumshoe: The real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt. Phoenix: Really? How much does he owe? Gumshoe: This is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red. Phoenix: H-Half a million? Are we talking dollars? Gumshoe: Yeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble! Phoenix: Sorry. That figure just took me by surprise. Gumshoe: Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch. Jean's Loan Contract added to the Court Record. Armstrong's secret (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes...

Present Sports Paper Gumshoe: So according to the boys down at the lab, the doodles were probably made by the victim. Phoenix: Probably? Gumshoe: Analyzing this kind of writing is difficult since it's done with a fiber-tipped pen. But don't worry! I'll vouch for it. Phoenix: (Why would Gumshoe have to vouch for it? Can't it stand on its own?) Small Bottle Gumshoe: You got one of those aroma bottles too, huh? Phoenix: Only this one doesn't smell. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get you... Phoenix: This was mixed in with all the other aromatherapy bottles, but it's not the same. It doesn't even look the same, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: A cologne bottle that doesn't smell, huh? Smells like a skunk to me, pal! Mind letting me borrow that bottle for a while? I wanna send it to the lab for analysis. Phoenix: (The victim was poisoned, so the contents of this bottle are pretty important...) Small Bottle given to Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: I had a lunch there was something funny about that chef. Phoenix: You suspect Jean Armstrong? Gumshoe: I've got that guy's number. I know what his secret is. Phoenix: (That must be the same secret Gumshoe was talking about before.) Gumshoe: I guess I'd better fill you in on the details. About this Armstrong guy's secret, I mean... Jean's Loan Contract Gumshoe: It's for half a million dollars, pal! That's... um... half a million dollar bills! Phoenix: (What was the \"um\" in there for!?) Is there really that much money tied up in this case? Gumshoe: I can't give you an answer on that, pal. Not without the case file in front of me. But I'll tell you this... That Armstrong guy would've done anything for cash. He was desperate, you know? Phoenix: No, I don't. But I think I sort of get the picture. After examining table in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Vitamin Square Phoenix: Hmm, the old guy's not here anymore. (Drat. And I still have some unanswered questions for him.) Examine Motor scooter Leads to: \"A scooter, huh?\" Phoenix: A scooter, huh? Who'd leave it right in the middle of the park like this? The wheel guard and the light are busted... I guess it must have been in an accident.

Take that! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it... This old guy has got something to hide. But what could it be?) Trés Bien regular (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Why are you a regular at a restaurant that you clearly hate, sir? Old Man: Take that, pigeons! See how you like these seeds! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (It's no good. I'm gonna have to break his Psyche-Lock. I just can't figure out what he would be hiding. I mean, I'm only asking him why he goes to a particular restaurant.) Trés Bien regular (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Um... Sir... Old Man: Yes, it's true! I was there for the young girl. Fine, so I'm a dirty, wicked, sinful old devil! Phoenix: No, no... I didn't mean it like that... Old Man: I even get one of those lousy cups of javaccino every time. For 8 dollars! All because of the serving girl! Punish me! Lock me up! Phoenix: Really, that's not what I'm here for. Old Man: You'll be the same! Another 20 years and you'll understand what it's like! You'll know how painful it is to be an old man like me! Phoenix: No, really. Listen, sir... Old Man: Stop calling me that! I have a name you know, boy! So show some respect, hmm!? I'm Victor Kudo. Phoenix: S-Sorry... Mr. Kudo. Kudo: You young ones think you know it all, don't you? Well, I'm not saying another word! I won't tell you anything more! Phoenix: (This guy was in the restaurant at the time of the incident. Which means I have to hear his testimony, one way or another!) Kudo: Hmph! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... I even broke his Psyche-Locks and everything... (Changed from [I don't believe this... I even broke his Psyche-Lock and everything...] in the original release) I guess I'll have to try to get him when he's in a better mood.)

Old Man: Wh-What do you mean!? Phoenix: I don't think you go to that restaurant for the food at all. Old Man: You insolent brat! How dare you accuse me! What proof have you got!?

I haven't done a jot of work since I was born. Other than feeding the pigeons. Phoenix: (What a load of crock!) Old Man: The taste's another story, but the price... It's nothing to me. Phoenix: So, you're saying that you go there because you've got money to burn? Old Man: Exactly! I have so much cash, I go for a swim in my money vault every day!

Old Man: What's your problem? You think a poor man would be better off drinking dishwater, do you? Is that it!? Phoenix: N-No. I wasn't thinking that. I was wondering if the coffee there is really that great... Old Man: No, it's not. But... But anyway! Yes! That place has free newspapers to read every day. Phoenix: Newspapers? Old Man: Exactly.

Phoenix: And you are probably telling the truth here. Because you weren't looking at the girl's face... But at her outfit! Old Man: *gulp* Phoenix: That's the truth, isn't it?

Kudo: Eating the food at that restaurant really takes me back to my days in France. Mia: What a lovely story. Phoenix: (London's in England, not France!) Kudo: Oh, yes! France is wonderful. I'd love to show you around the city some time! It-It's too much! I can't take it! I want... France! Mia: Ha ha ha! Phoenix: (I can't believe Mia's laughing at the guy... *sigh*) Trés Bien regular Mia: You visit Trés Bien a lot, don't you? Kudo: Of course! I mean, yes. I'd like to come and see you there. Heh heh heh. Mia: Really? Oh, you flatter me so! (Changed from [Really? Oh, you're so flattering!] in the original release) The owner would be delighted to welcome you, I'm sure. Kudo: Be careful of that chef, my dear! Phoenix: The chef? You mean Mr. Armstrong? Kudo: That's right. The man's an ex-con. Phoenix: He... He's an ex-con!? Armstrong's record (appears after \"Trés Bien regular\") Leads to: \"Whatever did Mr. Armstrong do!?\" Mia: Whatever did Mr. Armstrong do!? Kudo: Oh, no! Those eyes! I can't take this! Phoenix: (Mia's really got this guy eating out of her hand...) Kudo: He steals things. From his customers. Phoenix: From his customers? Kudo: Gloves, handkerchiefs... Little things, mainly. He's a pilferer! So you be careful around him, my dear. Mia: Are you sure about this? Kudo: Of course! He was arrested for it once. I was there when it happened, having my javaccino. Phoenix: (He really is a regular!) Kudo: Let me write you a little haiku about it. Phoenix: A haiku? Kudo: A Japanese poem. It'll explain all you need to know about that chef. Victor's Note added to the Court Record. Kudo: If he takes anything again, you let me know! If it's not too expensive, I'll buy you a replacement! Phoenix: (Poor guy. He couldn't do enough for Mia.) Mia: OK, Phoenix. That's about as much as I can do to help. Phoenix: Thanks, Mia. We got some really important information thanks to you. Mia: Honestly! I can't believe Maya called me for something like this! Criminal Affairs Dept. Present Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: You're looking upbeat, as usual. Maya: And you're looking tired as usual, Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yeah. That's life, huh? One guy's got it all, and one guy's got squat. Maya: Is it just me or did the room get darker all of a sudden...? You know, Detective. This is the year of the, um... gum! Gumshoe: I-It is? Maya: Yeah. ...I think. Gumshoe: Gum, huh? This is gonna be a great year for this ol' Gumshoe then, right? Maya: Look at that. He perked up in no time! Phoenix: Maya... Don't mess with him like that. After clearing \"Armstrong's secret\" Talk option in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept. and clearing \"Armstrong's record\" Talk option in Vitamin Square: January 6Trés Bien Maya: I guess it's about time to wrap up today's investigation. Phoenix: Had enough of being a waitress? Maya: Yeah. Plus, no one came to the restaurant... Armstrong: Oh là là! Mademoiselle Maya! Non! 'Ow can you leave like z'is!? Maya: I-I'm sorry... Phoenix: (That reminds me. Mr. Armstrong had a Psyche-Lock or three, didn't he? I'm going to have to break those...) Mr. Armstrong. I hope you won't mind, but I'd like to have another word with you... Armstrong: Volontiers! Of course! Talk Maggey's motive Phoenix: When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen? Armstrong: M-Monsieur... I cannot... Phoenix: Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Armstrong: N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Phoenix: (Somehow... I've gotta get this guy to spill the beans on everything he knows.) Maggey's motive (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong. You said that the victim had a winning lottery ticket for half a million dollars. How did you know he had something like that in the first place? Armstrong: Z'e man... 'E was listening to la radio wi'z 'is earpiece. Phoenix: (Hmm, Maggey said something about that, too.) Armstrong: La winning number was announced on la news, I think. All of a sudden, 'e exploded! \"Yes! 'Alf a million!\" 'e shouted. Phoenix: And the ticket? Armstrong: Oui. 'E 'ad all of 'is tickets spread out on la table. I... I was so desperately in need of money, so I... Phoenix: Put the poison in his coffee? Armstrong: Non, non, non, non, non! Oh, non, you naughty man! I simply 'elped myself to one of 'is tickets. Maya: What? Armstrong: La victim collapsed, and Maggey passed out. I thought to myself, \"Pourquoi pas?\" 'E 'ad so many of zem. Phoenix: (Yeah, but only one of them was the winning ticket, right?) Maya: How could you do that, Mr. Armstrong!? Maggey was arrested because of you! Armstrong: Non! Z'is is not true! Winning ticket (appears after \"Maggey's motive\") Leads to: \"I did not take it! La ticket for 'alf a million, I mean.\" Present Job Listings Armstrong: Oh lá lá! You are looking for la job also? Phoenix: N-No! Armstrong: Oui, oui. Your looks are un peu, unusual, shall we say? But I love your style! Phoenix: I look \"unusual\"? Armstrong: It will suit you perfectly, la uniform of la waitress! Phoenix: (I just knew it...) Lunch Special Armstrong: Oh lá lá! So you 'ave eaten my lunch, oui? Tell me, monsieur. Did you enjoy la lunch I prepared for you? Phoenix: It was a... unique and... wild mixture of flavors. Maya: That was the first time I ever had lobster, you know! Armstrong: Lobster? Z'ere was no lobster in my lunch... Maya: Huh? But, it said, \"lobster\" right on the menu. Armstrong: Mademoiselle Maya. Please, you must read la menu more carefully. It says, \"A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with a balsamic vinaigrette. Maya: Oh. It's only inspired, is it? Armstrong: Oui. Inspired by z'ese ingredients, but not per'aps made from z'em, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Well, guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, Nick. Phoenix: (The way the lunch tasted, it's probably 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.) Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Maggey's Motive -- Armstrong: Wh-What is 'appening? I do not like zis 'orrible feeling. Phoenix: I have to know the truth. What happened that day? Armstrong: ... Alors, alors! I will confess everything! Just don't 'urt me! Phoenix: Huh? (Well that was a new world record!) Armstrong: It was a lottery ticket. Phoenix: A lottery ticket? Armstrong: La man who died 'ere 'ad a lottery ticket. For 'alf a million dollars! Phoenix: H-HALF A MILLION!? Armstrong: Oui. But after la incident, z'is ticket... It disappeared! Phoenix: (The ticket disappeared...?) Armstrong: Z'is was la motive z'at la prosecution gave for Maggey. Z'ey said z'at she poisoned the man to get ze 'alf a million dollar lottery ticket. Phoenix: Why didn't you tell me about this sooner? Armstrong: Mais, alors... Phoenix: You've been trying to hide this information about the lottery ticket from me. And I want to know the reason why! Armstrong: Non, monsieur! You doubt me? But I 'ave confessed to you everything I know! Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong. The half a million dollar lottery ticket... I think I know who took it. I think the winning ticket was stolen by this person. Present Jean Armstrong profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Armstrong! I believe there is a very high probability that it was you.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? How about it? Armstrong: Ça va? Phoenix: Excuse me? Armstrong: It means, \"'Ow are you?\" Phoenix: Oh. Um... I'm fine, thanks. Armstrong: Bien. I am 'appy to 'ear it. Phoenix: ... (Doesn't sound like I'm doing so fine with this Psyche-Lock though...) Armstrong: Poor Maggey, she was tempted by la evil, non? Phoenix: (No! If it was really Maggey, then you'd have no reason to hide the facts from me!) Leads back to: \"Mr. Armstrong.\" Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong! I believe there is a very high probability that it was you. Armstrong: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (Wow!

Leads back to: \"I am not Mask☆DeMasque! I'm not z'e kind of person who steals z'e property of others.\" Armstrong: What is z'is!? A poem? Oh, monsieur, you know me so well! I adore poems!

Phoenix: I'm sorry to have to bring it up, Mr. Armstrong... ...but you have been arrested for stealing from your customers before, haven't you? Armstrong: Mon dieu! Le mensonge! You are z'e liar! Phoenix: You deny it? Armstrong: Do not make la false accusations, s'il vous plaît! So do you 'ave any proof? I want to see la incontestable proof that I 'ave ever stolen from one of my customers!

Leads back to: \"So do you 'ave any proof?\" Phoenix: It seems old habits die hard, Mr. Armstrong. Armstrong: Wh-What is z'at? Phoenix: This is my Magatama. And I found it in your kitchen. Armstrong: Nooooon! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (Wow, that scream just about broke some windows...) Armstrong: Oui... oui... I-I 'ave a weakness for la little trinkets and la figurines. My 'and, it just slips out. I cannot stop it. Phoenix: You've stolen handkerchiefs, gloves, and other things from your customers, right? Armstrong: Oui! It is la truth! I am just a timid little girl inside, monsieur. A timid little girl! Besides, z'is time, it was not la small trinket, oui? It was 500,000 dollars! Mais, non! Why would I steal it? I 'ave no need for such money. Phoenix: Really now? Armstrong: Oh, monsieur. What is it? Phoenix: Isn't it true that you're in some pretty serious trouble? And that you are in desperate need of a large amount of cash?

Maya: But you just told us you did! You said you took a ticket! Armstrong: Mais non, ma fille! It was not... ???: That's enough. Maya: Huh? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr. Godot! Phoenix: What in the heck are you doing here!? Godot: Urgh! This is without doubt... the worst coffee I have ever tasted, Mr. Armstrong. Phoenix: (He came in here for coffee!? Does his craving for coffee know no bounds!?) Godot: Perhaps Mr. Armstrong stole one of the victim's tickets on the day in question. Armstrong: I am la air'ead, non? Just a pretty little girl who everyone is laughing at. Maya: But, in that case, Maggey shouldn't be the only one under suspicion... Godot: He had the wrong ticket. Phoenix: ...What? Godot: Mr. Armstrong made off with the winning ticket's pretty neighbor. Maya: So... the ticket he took was worthless? Godot: Not quite. He did win something. A dollar. Armstrong: You see! I am just a pretty face! W'izout my looks, I 'ave nothing! Phoenix: So... What happened to the winning ticket, then? The one he meant to steal. Godot: Indeed. What did happen to it? I don't like spoiling myself by watching trailers, so... ...we'll just wait and see how the movie turns out tomorrow, won't we? Maya: Nngh... Armstrong: Voilà! You two! Time to laugh at la pretty little air'ead! Phoenix: (Looks like I won't be needing this note anymore.) Victor's Note thrown into the trash. Phoenix: Looks like we've got a new mystery now. Namely, where did the winning ticket go? Maya: I've got a bad feeling about this. Phoenix: Well, anyway. We can't let Maggey suffer any longer for this. And certainly not again. To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)

I guess I should've expected this. Nobody saw the other guy, huh? But he was there when I took the coffee over, sir. Scout's honor! ???: Maggey! Byrde: Ack! D-Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: A-Are you doing alright!? How're you feeling!? Byrde: ...As if you need to ask either question, sir. Gumshoe: Don't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK? Byrde: Roger! Gumshoe: And you! Phoenix: Y-Yes? Gumshoe: You'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest! Phoenix: (I-I think he's serious!) Maya: Hey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right? Gumshoe: Yup. Maya: So you'll be able to help Maggey out, right? Byrde: Really? Can you, sir!? Gumshoe: O... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright? Phoenix: S-Sure. Gumshoe: OK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!? Byrde: I can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you. Maya: Looks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh? Phoenix: (I can only wish...) January 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Godot: ... Aaah, bitter! Judge: Mr... Um... Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor? Judge: Aaaah! Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong!? Judge: Nothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating. Phoenix: No, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix. Judge: I see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he? Phoenix: (\"Our trusty\"...?) Judge: So, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please. Godot: Mr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today. Phoenix: But I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright! Godot: I wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out. Phoenix: (There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!) Judge: As everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial. Phoenix: (I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!) Judge: Now then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness. Godot: Let's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation? Gumshoe: ... Judge: Witness! State your name for the court! Gumshoe: Huh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe. Godot: Other way around, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir! Judge: Since yesterday? Gumshoe: Yeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now. Maya: I hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake. Judge: I see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case? Gumshoe: Y-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report. Judge: The court accepts this into evidence. Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Um... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress. Judge: The waitress being the accused? Gumshoe: Yeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo. Judge: Hmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me. Trés Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record. Godot: Come, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands. Judge: Now then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony. Gumshoe: Umm... Yes, sir... Witness Testimony -- The Incident -- Gumshoe: When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir. We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time. Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup. And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch! And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive. Judge: Hmm... Godot: Using the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady! Judge: The facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but... Phoenix: Yes? Judge: Please, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood? Phoenix: I already told you! That wasn't me! Cross Examination -- The Incident -- Gumshoe: When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Can I stop you for just a minute? Gumshoe: Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence? Phoenix: (He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's what she said. And I-- Godot: Godot: What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction? Phoenix: Hey! Godot: Sadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Well, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way. Godot: Ha...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Trés Bien, Trite! Phoenix: ...! Godot: I have here in my possession a ticket. Phoenix: A ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.) Godot: Yes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen. Judge: This is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct? Godot: I think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table? Phoenix: Urk! Judge: It certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Can I stop you for just a minute? Gumshoe: Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence? Phoenix: (He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's what she said. And I-- Godot: Godot: What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction? Phoenix: Hey! Godot: Sadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table. Judge: Hmm... Gumshoe: We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He was listening to his radio, you say? Gumshoe: Yeah. He had a portable radio in his chest pocket. Maya: Maggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\". Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: And what was it that the victim was listening to on the radio, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Huh? How should I know? Phoenix: (Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.) Maya: This isn't going very well, is it...? Judge: Hmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used? Leads back to cross-examination Gumshoe: Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else? Gumshoe: Not sure I get you, pal. Phoenix: Was the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder? Gumshoe: If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance. Phoenix: So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper... Godot: Godot: Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite? Gumshoe: The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: It seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee? Gumshoe: Huh!? What do you mean? Phoenix: According to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!? Gumshoe: Oh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think-- Godot: Godot: In case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there. Gumshoe: Huh? For me? Godot: \"Oh, hey! You're right!\"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence. Gumshoe: Th... THAT piece... sir? Godot: Yes. THAT piece. Gumshoe: ... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again? Godot: This! Phoenix: (Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?) Gumshoe: Oh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup. Godot: Yes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim. Judge: Oh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it. Godot: Conclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this! Phoenix: Uuuurgh! Gumshoe: For the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's. Coffee Cup added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Upon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance... Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else? Gumshoe: Not sure I get you, pal. Phoenix: Was the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder? Gumshoe: If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance. Phoenix: So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper... Godot: Godot: Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite? Gumshoe: The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: It seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee. Gumshoe: And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: (Potassium cyanide? I've heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: It's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history. Maya: How much is too much? Godot: A lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off. Maya: 0.2 grams? How much is that? Gumshoe: You know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much. Phoenix: (Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...) Judge: Hmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere. Gumshoe: And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Some kind of a motive\"? Gumshoe: Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion. Godot: Godot: You know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get it. Godot: I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out. Gumshoe: *gulp* Godot: So stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive? Phoenix: (Come on, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: She was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket. Phoenix: I knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.) Gumshoe: It disappeared from the scene of the crime. Godot: And it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million! Maya: Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one... Phoenix: (Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Wait a minute! The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client! Godot: Ha...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question! Judge: Th-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...? Gumshoe: One of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant. Phoenix: WH-WHAAAAAT!? Judge: Order! Order! Godot: Ha...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress. Judge: Y-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately! Phoenix: (Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...) Victim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record. Judge: The ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...? Godot: It's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor. Phoenix: (And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey's person...] in the original release) Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Victim's Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Some kind of a motive\"? Gumshoe: Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion. Godot: Godot: You know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get it. Godot: I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out. Gumshoe: *gulp* Godot: So stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive? Phoenix: (Come on, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: She was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket. Phoenix: I knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.) Gumshoe: It disappeared from the scene of the crime. Godot: And it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million! Maya: Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one... Phoenix: (Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?) Maya: You really think there are any contradictions in this testimony? Phoenix: To be honest, I don't know. Maya: But Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line? Phoenix: (I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.) After selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements: Judge: That's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime. Godot: I like an old man who knows the score. Judge: There is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules! Godot: I don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money. Maya: Not good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast. Phoenix: Yeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already. Godot: I'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence. Phoenix: (He's got more evidence against Maggey!?) Godot: This is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time. Maya: Wow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen... Phoenix: Th-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?) Godot: Ha...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself. Phoenix: The coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye... Godot: Of course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more. Judge: Something else? I presume you mean... Godot: Of course. I'm referring to the pocket. Phoenix: The... pocket? Godot: A search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket! Phoenix: A bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket? Gumshoe: Yeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it. Phoenix: WHAAAT!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence. Apron added to the Court Record. Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record. Judge: There's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court? Godot: Bloodstain? What bloodstain would that be? Judge: Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron! Godot: That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain! Phoenix: (You don't need to be told! Just look at it!) Godot: Well, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!? Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir. Phoenix: Ketchup!? Gumshoe: She must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day. Judge: ... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe! Godot: Pull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness! Gumshoe: Unnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already. Judge: Hmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case. Phoenix: ...! Judge: The motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established. Godot: Well, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all. Phoenix: (Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!) Judge: Witness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there. Witness Testimony -- The Investigation -- Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir. Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her. The victim didn't have any identification on him. But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly. When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison. And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene. Judge: Hmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good. Godot: Last chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite! Phoenix: ...! Godot: Don't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin! Cross Examination -- The Investigation -- Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Scary old man\", Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: There's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened. Phoenix: (Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...) Gumshoe: Officers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. \"What took you so long!?\" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds... Judge: Hmm... Seeds... Godot: Ha...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth. Phoenix: (I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...) Godot: The old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime. Gumshoe: Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How long was the defendant unconscious for? Gumshoe: The officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself. Phoenix: (I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...) Gumshoe: I woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful. Phoenix: (You're a professional detective, Gumshoe. Not a professional bird watcher!) Godot: Save the romantics for your own time, Detective. All we need to know about is the investigation. Gumshoe: Oops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I? Gumshoe: The victim didn't have any identification on him. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then? Gumshoe: No, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet. Phoenix: Fifty-eight cents...? Gumshoe: Yeah. I can't believe I found someone with less in their wallet than me, pal! Judge: The victim sounds like he was a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... Why not give him a bit of an edge? Phoenix: (I think I'm on to something here...) Gumshoe: But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...) Gumshoe: There was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket. Godot: It seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Trés Bien. Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?) Leave it Phoenix: (I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the prescription bag Phoenix: So what sort of medicine was in the bag? Gumshoe: Well... Actually, the bag we found was empty. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Yeah. Completely empty. Phoenix: (It was completely empty...?) Victim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record. Godot: Ha...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence? Desperate, are you, Trite? Phoenix: ...! Godot: Now, what happened with the investigation after that, Detective? Leads back to cross-examination Ask about his health insurance Phoenix: So, the victim had no form of identification on him, correct? Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: And yet, before arriving at the restaurant, he went to see a doctor. Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him! Judge: Oh! That is very true! Phoenix: The fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen! Godot: Ha...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with! Phoenix: Huh? Judge: Hmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... A bit of an edge never hurt anyone. Maya: Looks like we're off course again, Nick. Judge: Witness. Please continue with your testimony. Explain for the court the events following the preliminary investigation. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Victim's Prescription Bag is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...) Gumshoe: There was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket. Godot: It seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Trés Bien. Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court. Gumshoe: When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But the defendant had been passed out for a while, correct? In that case... Isn't it possible someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket!? Gumshoe: Hey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal! Judge: Hmm... Gumshoe: It happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes! Godot: Godot: Keep up this crazy testimony, Detective, and those shoes will end up down your throat! Gumshoe: Sorry... Godot: So, Trite. \"Someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket\"...? That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence? Phoenix: Um... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...) Judge: It appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness. Gumshoe: And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for. Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: Interesting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh? Phoenix: (And they're just going to let him get away with it...?) Judge: It was just one dollar, Detective. Maya: I guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe. Present Victim's Prescription Bag Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you.\" Phoenix: If I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict! Maya: Gumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something! Phoenix: Yeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious. Maya: Come on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony. Gumshoe: Oho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you? Phoenix: You testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later? Gumshoe: Um, no. They didn't. Phoenix: The victim was given a prescription right before going to Trés Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!? Gumshoe: Y-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!! Judge: I-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!? Gumshoe: I, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh? Phoenix: The victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself! Judge: O-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that? Godot: Ha...! That's all. Phoenix: What!? Godot: Read for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will. Phoenix: What's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological? Judge: Just what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot? Godot: Hardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say. Judge: A war wound? Godot: The day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum. Phoenix: He ruptured his eardrum!? Judge: Then what on earth was the prescription he was given? Godot: It was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested! Phoenix: What!? Godot: It's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear. Judge: Yes. Here it is. In very, very fine print. Godot: It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication. Phoenix: Uuurgh... Judge: It seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all. Phoenix: N-No... Maya: Nick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over! Phoenix: (She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?) Push the medication issue Leads to: \"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\" Leave it Phoenix: It does seem as it the medication isn't connected to the case. Godot: Ha...! Maybe the last Mr. Trite was the real one. At least he didn't waste time. Judge: Indeed... If you have nothing further to add to this medication issue... ...the facts of this case seem no different to those presented on the last trial. I would therefore have no choice but to hand down my verdict. Phoenix: Uh... Umm...! Maya: Nick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground! Judge: Now then... Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Your Honor! Actually, this prescription... is absolutely pivotal to the case! Judge: Mr. Wright! Did you not just say the exact opposite only moments ago!? Phoenix: (Gotta lose a few battles in order to win the war, I suppose.) Leads to: \"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\" Phoenix: Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!? Godot: ...! Judge: But the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal! Phoenix: Phoenix: That doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth! Godot: Godot: You know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide. Phoenix: Phoenix: It hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable! Godot: Aaargh! Judge: That's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call? Godot: ... Judge: Mr. Godot...? Godot: ... Gumshoe: Um... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder. Phoenix: (Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?) Judge: Very well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me. Maya: Yay! Good job, Nick! Judge: The court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness. Godot: Ha...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups. Judge: Court is adjourned for recess! January 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Maya: Phew! That was close! Phoenix: Tell me about it... I nearly died in there! Byrde: That's my line, sir! Maya: No! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit. Byrde: Looks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!? Maya: Huh? Byrde: He said he'd help me. But he totally set me up! Phoenix: I don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right? Byrde: It's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again! Phoenix: (Poor Gumshoe...) Maya: So the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right? Phoenix: Yeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds! Byrde: I bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know? Maya: Yeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds! January 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: Court will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please. Godot: The prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand. Godot: Name and occupation, if you don't mind. Kudo: The name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too. Phoenix: We don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation. Kudo: My occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!? Phoenix: Kimono embroidery? Kudo: That's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed! Maya: Wow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime. Kudo: Anyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile! Phoenix: (That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...) Judge: Now then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident? Kudo: Oh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino. Judge: Seeds? Kudo: What do you think these are, hmm!? Judge: I-I see... Godot: So you saw everything that happened, gramps? Kudo: Did I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all! Godot: Then please, tell the court. We're all ears. Kudo: Sure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail! Phoenix: (He's really getting into this...) Witness Testimony -- What I Witnessed -- Kudo: The young man was reading the sports paper. The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed. That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well! Judge: Mr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress. Kudo: Kah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!? Judge: N-Newfangled? Kudo: All this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you! Judge: E-Excuse me... Kudo: Listen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away! Judge: Well, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Cross Examination -- What I Witnessed -- Kudo: The young man was reading the sports paper. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you saw the victim, then? You saw Mr. Glen Elg? Kudo: I wanted to know if Gusten Brawn retained his championship or not. Phoenix: (So he was looking at the sports paper the victim was reading, huh...) And at the location in question... ...there are partitions between tables on the same side of the restaurant, right? Kudo: So what if there are? Phoenix: If you say that you could see the victim... ...that means you were sitting at a table on the other side of the restaurant, correct? Kudo: Kah! I go to that place to drink javaccino! I don't go to sit! I don't remember what table I was sitting at! Phoenix: (You mean you go there to eye the waitress!) Kudo: The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw? Kudo: Victor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i! Phoenix: I see... Kudo: My eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving. Phoenix: (...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.) Kudo: And I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well! Phoenix: (I bet I know what's coming up and something tells me I'm not going to like it...) Leave it Phoenix: (It'd be dangerous to press this too much. I'd better ignore it for now.) So, what happened next? Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Your Honor. We need more clarification on what was put into the victim's coffee. I'd like to ask that the witness add what he knows about this to his testimony. Judge: Hmm... I agree. Witness, will you enlighten us, please? Kudo: Sure, sure. Adds statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\" Press (after adding statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw? Kudo: Victor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i! Phoenix: I see... Kudo: My eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving. Phoenix: (...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.) Kudo: And I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well! Kudo: There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: D-Did she really put that into the coffee? Kudo: You doubt me, boy!? She too some out of a small, brown bottle and sprinkled it in. Phoenix: Couldn't she have been adding sugar? Kudo: Sugar!? In a small, brown bottle like that!? Judge: \"Like that\"? Witness, could you please describe the bottle in more concrete terms? Godot: Ha...! A bottle like this, perhaps? Kudo: Oh, there it is! That's the one! Judge: That's the bottle of potassium cyanide, I presume? Godot: So what did the accused put into the coffee? I think it's clear, don't you? Phoenix: Argh... Kudo: The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He took just one sip? Kudo: You young'uns! You waste everything! Those javaccinos cost 8 dollars! In the good old days, we would have drank every last drop, eaten the cup, and then died! Phoenix: (Congratulations. You have earned the title of Battiest Man To Grace A Courtroom.) Godot: So it was an immediate death? Well, with potassium cyanide, I suppose that is possible. Kudo: Oh, yes. He slumped over without so much as a twitch! I felt the javaccino I'd just drank turn sour in my stomach. Godot: Oh, yes. I know that feeling. Judge: And the waitress? I presume she is...? Kudo: That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by? Kudo: Particular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is! Phoenix: Sorry? Kudo: You can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform! Phoenix: Phoenix: So the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me! Judge: Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image. Maya: Don't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together! Phoenix: (I-I guess I got a bit carried away...) Kudo: Kah! There are other things I recognize about her, too. Phoenix: (He seems pretty sure of himself. What should I do?) Leave it Phoenix: (There's got to be a better line of attack than this. That's what I should be looking for now...) Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Sure, you saw a waitress take the coffee over to the victim. But what matters is whether that waitress was Maggey Byrde or not. Judge: Quite right. Mr. Kudo. These other \"features\" that you recognize about the defendant... I would ask you to add them to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Adds statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\" Press (after adding statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by? Kudo: Particular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is! Phoenix: Sorry? Kudo: You can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform! Phoenix: Phoenix: So the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me! Judge: Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image. Maya: Don't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together! Phoenix: (I-I guess I got a bit carried away...) Kudo: Kah! There are other things I recognize about her, too. Kudo: There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (There's no doubt he remembers the waitress pretty well. What should I do? I get the feeling there's something more to this somehow...) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I must be imagining it. I need to find another angle with this guy.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the straps Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. You seem especially interested in straps. Why is that? Kudo: Wh-What? Phoenix: The ribbon in her hair, the straps on her apron. What's the fascination? Kudo: F-Fascination? Godot: Godot: People have all kinds of fetishes, Trite. We don't need to embarrass the witness. Kudo: Listen, you young upstarts! I haven't got some sick strap fetish! Judge: Hmm... Is there any relevance to the witness's unusual love of straps, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I was just curious as to why he was so fixated on the waitress's straps... Kudo: I said I haven't got a strap fetish! How many times do I have to repeat myself!? Judge: Very well. Continue with your testimony, Mr. Kudo. And make it strapless. Kudo: *grumble grumble* Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the waitress's back Phoenix: The identifying \"features\" you described are all things you would see from the back. Kudo: So what? Phoenix: Is it possible that... ...you never saw the waitress from the front at all!? Godot: Godot: Ha...! He's got you there, gramps! Phoenix: People normally talk about facial features when they're asked to describe someone. But this witness's testimony is nothing but straps and ribbons! Kudo: Th-This is harassment! I tell you I'm not obsessed with straps or ribbons! I'm just telling you what I saw! Judge: Mr. Kudo, the court requests that you add details about any identifying features... Features you observed from the front, that is, to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Maya: The old man's testimony is getting longer and longer! Phoenix: And if I can't find a hole in it soon, it'll get even longer, I bet. Adds statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\" Press (after adding statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm... Kudo: There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't find anything to be distinct, but you did clearly see the witness's face, yes? Kudo: No question about it! I didn't come this far to back down now! Victor Kudo never backs down! Phoenix: (That's not the answer I was looking for, but OK...) Maya: This has turned into a matter of pride for Old Seedy now, I guess... I wonder if he really did see Maggey's face or not... Phoenix: (Like I thought, we need some concrete proof of this. Proof that the old guy didn't see the waitress clearly from the front.) Present Apron Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\" Maya: Do you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it? Phoenix: Well, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there. Maya: But he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress... Phoenix: I-I guess... (Hmm, she makes a good point though...) Maya: Hey! Did I just say something clever? Phoenix: I wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw really was Maggey... Maya: That's what we have to figure out, Nick! Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this. Kudo: Kah! That filthy thing would suit filth like you just perfectly. Actually, it reminds me of what my grandson looks like, just after he's done eating. Phoenix: Have you ever seen this before? Kudo: Of course I haven't! Do you think I'd forget something as dirty as that!? Hmm? Well? You half-witted clot!? Phoenix: ... Judge: ... ......... Kudo: Wh-What!? What is it!? Ever since I said, \"you half-witted clot\", there's been an eerie silence in here. Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. This apron... ...is the apron worn by the defendant on the day of the poisoning! Kudo: Uh? Phoenix: And as you just said yourself... ...you wouldn't forget something like this. Which means, is you had really seen this apron before... Kudo: Er... Phoenix: Yes, you know what I'm getting at! You couldn't have possibly seen the waitress from the front! Kudo: ... Oops! Judge: Witness! You can't just \"oops\" your way out of this! Godot: Ha...! Well, well... Looks like we finally have a genuine trial on our hands. Phoenix: ... Godot: Listen, Trite. Here are the facts. On the day of the incident, there was only one waitress in the restaurant. Judge: That being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde? Godot: Exactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching! Judge: Hmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing. Godot: Just tell the court exactly what you saw, gramps. Kudo: You can rely on me, Captain! My noggin's in perfect working order. I can't remember a single occasion when I forgot what burger a customer wanted! Maya: He can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out... Judge: Very well. Let's test just how good your memory and attention to detail is, Mr. Kudo. Tell us what you remember about the victim. Witness Testimony -- About the Victim -- Kudo: He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles. He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages! The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well. Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino. The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip. Judge: The testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail. Kudo: Oh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything! Maya: How are we going to handle this, Nick? Phoenix: We only need to do one thing. We just need to prove that the old man's memory is shot. Maya: Just trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel? Phoenix: (I suppose... But it's what I do best.) Cross Examination -- About the Victim -- Kudo: He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Spectacles? Kudo: Dark glasses to you! One of the lenses was green, but the other was broken. Newfangled rubbish! That's why I remember him so well. Phoenix: (He did have some kind of lens over his left eye... But I wouldn't have called it a pair of glasses.) Judge: Hmm... He seems to have been wearing some rather modern-looking shades. Perhaps I should take to wearing some, and rival Mr. Godot's sharp appearance. Maya: Ah! We better come up with something sharp, and quick! Phoenix: (Guess I'll wait and see if I should challenge him about the \"spectacles\"...) Kudo: He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The newspaper was a sports paper, was it? Kudo: That young hooligan! I nearly asked him, \"Can't you even read without fidgeting, hmm!?\" How was I supposed to be able to read the back page with all that rustling going on!? I needed to find out if Gusten Brawn retained his championship title! Phoenix: (It was his paper, not yours! If you wanted to know so bad, why didn't you buy your own!?) Kudo: What are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? How dare you judge me! Phoenix: Ow! Ooow! Maya: Gusten Brawn got beaten yesterday, by the way. Anyway... Kudo: The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The wireless? Kudo: The decadent young rascal! In my day, it was one or the other! Read the paper, or listen to the wireless! Phoenix: (...Oh boy.) Kudo: And using an earpiece! It's selfish, that's what it is! I was straining my ears, but I couldn't catch any of it. Phoenix: (Was he that desperate to listen to the radio...?) Kudo: What are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? 2 you feel sorry for me! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Kudo: Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean the waitress, who you only saw from behind, right? Kudo: You're one of those, are you? You never let anything go, isn't that right? Phoenix: ...Maybe. Kudo: What does it matter if I saw her from the front or from behind!? My eyes don't lie! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! (I better not push it until I've got some hard evidence.) Kudo: The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"His free hand\"? Kudo: Yes. Phoenix: Which hand was that? Kudo: Weren't you listening before, cloth-ears!? I said he was rustling the newspaper with his right hand, didn't I? If his free hand wasn't his right hand, then which hand was it, you moron! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Godot: Ha...! Perhaps the great Mr. Trite has three hands! Phoenix: (Yeesh! I was only asking! No need to gang up on me and treat me like a freak!) Present Coffee Cup Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony?\" Phoenix: (The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.) Maya: I guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh? Phoenix: (Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!) Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony? That this was a way of testing the credibility of your memory? Kudo: I know, I know! There's nothing wrong with my memory, I tell you! Nothing! If I got anything wrong, I'll eat these seeds and sing the pigeon song! Godot: Care to tell us where this is going, Trite? Phoenix: According to Mr. Kudo, the victim was holding the paper in his right hand... ...while drinking coffee with his free hand, which would make that his left. Kudo: Kah! What is this? Kindergarten? Phoenix: But I would like the court to please take a look at this. Judge: That's the cup victim used, correct? Phoenix: Yes, and on the rim, you'll notice the mark left by the victim's lips. Judge: Yes. There is a stain left by the coffee. Phoenix: If you consider where that stain is, you'll clearly see... ...that the victim was holding the cup in his right hand! Kudo: But how...? Phoenix: Well, Mr. Kudo. The court is waiting for your epic performance! You said you'd eat those seeds and sing the pigeon song! Kudo: Aaaargh! Judge: Mr. Kudo... I'm afraid this is simply not acceptable. I think the witness had better go back to the park where he came from. Kudo: WAAAAIT! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to you tell me I'm mad, you're wrong! I don't care about that dirty coffee cup! I know what I saw! Judge: Y-You still insist on your testimony? Kudo: That young brat was holding the cup in his left hand! Oh, yes. No question! I'm a good, law-abiding citizen, I am. It's that dead young hotbot and you, you spikey-haired yahoo, who are at fault! Phoenix: (Who, me!?) Judge: Th-Thank you, old man. We've heard quite enough from you already. Kudo: Don't call me \"old man\", old man! Been around for 68 years, I have. You can't ignore me! LISTEN TO WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAAAAY! Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but... Godot: Sure, why not hear a little more? Judge: M-Mr. Godot! Godot: But this is my 16th cup of coffee... So this is your final stand. Kudo: Thank you, Captain! You can rely on Victor! Witness Testimony -- Left Hand or Right Hand -- Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs. He kept fiddling with it all the time. He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too. And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand! Judge: We know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye. Godot: It wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers. Judge: A monitor? You mean, like a television screen!? Godot: The inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work. Kudo: HDTV, DVD, CD... All these newfangled letters drive me mad! But they don't matter. I know what I saw, and I'm telling the truth! Phoenix: (It's true... He doesn't seem to be lying.) Kudo: And those are the facts, in good old black and white! Cross Examination -- Left Hand or Right Hand -- Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the victim was wearing an HMD. Kudo: HDTV, CD, DVD... What does it matter!? Phoenix: (It was none of them actually, but anyway...) And you're sure that he was wearing the earpiece on the same side? Kudo: No question! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting. Phoenix: (Yeah. That's pretty obvious if you look at the floor plans. From the opposite table, he'd only have a view of the side of the victim's head.) Present Victim's Prescription Bag or Glen Elg profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but...\" Kudo: He kept fiddling with it all the time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: It seems you kept an eye on Mr. Glen Elg. Kudo: He was getting on my nerves! Rustling that newspaper and fiddling with his earpiece all the time! And then he went and made all that fuss dying from one sip of javaccino! I wanted to say to him, \"Calm down, you young brat!\" Just looking at him made me suddenly speed up my seed eating! I could've chocked! Phoenix: (So I take it the victim was a walking ball of nervous energy...) Kudo: He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The earpiece you mentioned... Which hand did the victim touch it with? Kudo: ... You're one of those people! One of those people who uses his left hand to get things out of his right pocket. Or fastens his left cuff with his right hand? And when the tour guide says, \"On your right side, you'll see the famous blah-blah\"... ...you're the only one who deliberately looks left! Well? Aren't you? Phoenix: N-No! I didn't mean... Kudo: Obviously he used the hand on the same side of his body that the earpiece was in! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Ow! (So, if he had the HMD on his left side, then it was his left hand, I guess...) Kudo: And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You seem very sure of yourself, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: That's because I know what I saw, no matter what tricks you try to play on me! Phoenix: (It looks like he really did see the guy picking the cup up with his left hand. This is a dead end!) Maya: Well, Nick? What do you think? Phoenix: I think the guy's telling the truth. But even so... Something's not quite right. Maya: Then chuck evidence at him until he breaks! Phoenix: (But if he's not lying, there wouldn't be any contradictions in his testimony, right?) Phoenix: I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but... Mr. Kudo! There is something very strange about your observations of the victim. Kudo: What!? Phoenix: You say he was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the HMD. Kudo: No question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting. Phoenix: I don't think so. Kudo: Wh-What did you say!? Phoenix: You're no doubt unaware of this fact, Mr. Kudo. But the victim couldn't hear with his left ear! His eardrum was ruptured! Kudo: Eh? Phoenix: Traces of medication for his condition were found in his ear canal. That's right! It's impossible that the victim was wearing his earpiece in his left ear. Because he couldn't even hear in that ear! Kudo: ... Is that true, Captain? Godot: ...It is. Kudo: ...Pi... Pi-Pi-Pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Pretty pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Judge: Order! Order! Order! Phoenix: This witness's testimony is completely unreliable! He only saw the witness from behind. And he claims the victim was wearing an earpiece when we know his eardrum was ruptured! Well, Mr. Godot!? Godot: Aaaargh! A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup! The old man... ...is my drop of milk! Kudo: Captain! Are you calling me a drip!? Judge: This is the victim's coffee cup in which the potassium cyanide was found. The mark on the rim clearly shows that the victim picked it up with his right hand! Kudo: I'll never back down! I know I'm right! The lad drank his javaccino with his left hand! Godot: Let me put you out of your misery... Clearly, the victim used both hands. He took a sip with the cup held in his right hand, and then switched to his left... That's what the old man saw! Phoenix: Phoenix: Impossible! The witness has already testified on numerous occasions... ...that the victim died immediately after taking just one sip of the coffee. Godot: Godot: Which hand the victim used to pick up his cup is irrelevant, Your Honor. The facts still stand! With one hand or the other, Mr. Elg drank the poisoned coffee... ...Like this! Phoenix: Phoenix: Sadly, Mr. Godot, that doesn't wash! The point of this testimony was to establish whether the witness's memory was credible. And the results are clear! The testimony given by this witness is useless! Godot: Puuuurgh! Judge: I believe it is time to conclude today's proceedings. I am satisfied that the witness is not deceiving the court. But to be frank, his testimony is a farce! Kudo: D-Did you have to be so frank!? Take that, you pompous old fogey! Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo. You can't reach me from there. I'm ordering the defense and the prosecution to investigate this case further. That is all for now. This court is adjourned! ???: Kudo: WAAAAIT! If we stop now, where does that leave me? Judge: Leave you, Mr. Kudo? Kudo: Thanks to that blue-suited young upstart over there... ...I'm just a bumbling old man who can't even dot his t's or cross his i's now! Phoenix: (How is your bad memory my fault!?) Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but there's nothing I can do. Kudo: I've kept my mouth shut until now... ...but there's something else the court should know! Godot: What!? Phoenix: There's more? Kudo: To be perfectly honest, it might not be anything. But I want another chance! I want another crack at you, you young shark! Phoenix: M-Me? (He's looking at me like I'm some sort of evil Shogun...) Kudo: Well, everyone? What do you say to one final showdown? The final chapter in this eccentric old man's scrapbook! Godot: Sorry, gramps... I've already had my 17th cup of coffee. Kudo: What have you got to lose, Captain? I'll give you all the javaccino you want if you come to my house after the trial. (Changed from [I'll give you all the coffee you want if you come to my house after the trial.] in the original release) I may be 68 years old, but Victor Kudo is still a man! Judge: That's enough, witness. I believe it will be quicker for the court to just hear your testimony. Kudo: You bet! Much, much quicker! Maya: I can't believe this is happening... Kudo: Ha ha ha! You better get ready, youngster! Phoenix: I get the picture! Just quit throwing those seeds at me, would you!? (He's gotta be using some sort of infinite ammo code with that box of seeds...) Witness Testimony -- The Final Showdown -- Kudo: First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself. The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino... Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over. It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked! Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm? Judge: ... Um... Is that all? Kudo: Yes, that's all. I remember it perfectly. Eh!? You're doubting me again? You're doubting a poor, defenseless old man!? Judge: N-No. We are not doubting you, Mr. Kudo. Maya: Don't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick? Phoenix: Yeah. \"So what?\" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy! Kudo: You're a birdbrain, that's why that's all you can think of! Judge: Very well... Mr. Wright. Your final cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- The Final Showdown -- Kudo: First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Um... The court generally prefers if witnesses are sure of themselves, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Noisy brat! I'm warning you, I'm more savage than a macho man right now! You won't beat me with this testimony! This is the final battle! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! (He's chucking those seeds harder than ever! I better be careful...) Maya: Come on, Nick! Nail him! Kudo: The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The court has already heard that testimony, Mr. Kudo... Kudo: I know that! I was just setting the mood. How else am I supposed to build up the suspense, hmm!? Phoenix: The suspense? Kudo: Isn't it enough? Should I work the audience a bit more? Judge: No, no! Please continue, Mr. Kudo. As quickly as possible! Kudo: Alright. Now where was I...? ...Ah yes. The young boy slumped over the table, and... Kudo: Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A vase, you say? Kudo: Yes. There are vases on all the tables in that place. They're accidents waiting to happen! They're practically begging to be knocked over! Phoenix: (Well, he's right about there being vases. I do remember seeing them, too... There was a vase on the table when I ate munch there.) And you saw the moment when the victim actually knocked over the vase? Kudo: Well... it's hard to say... It's a bit unclear... How do you really define... Phoenix: OK, I get it. Kudo: I heard it break! And the sight of it is burned into my memory as clear as day! Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\" Kudo: It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Soaked in water, you mean? Kudo: Yes. It splashed me on the knee as well. Phoenix: You said you were sitting at a table across the room from the victim, correct? And yet, the water still managed to splash onto you? Kudo: ... It was cold! I clearly remember it splashing me! Phoenix: (Could the water really make it all the way across to the other side of the room...?) Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\" Kudo: Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean, the vase on the victim's table falling upside-down and breaking? Kudo: The vase turned upside-down, and my testimony's turning this case upside-down... It's a joke! I just wanted everyone to hear it! What do you think, Captain!? Godot: ...I'm impressed. By your ability to waste time. Phoenix: (Godot hasn't raised any objections for a while now...) Kudo: So, you young show-off! With that scrap of information, I'm throwing down the gauntlet! If I lose this one, I'll take it like a man and admit defeat! Phoenix: He's really giving you the evil eye, Maya. Maya: It's you he's looking at, Nick, not me! It's like he's saying, \"I triple dog dare you to find a contradiction, young'un!\" Phoenix: I guess I'll just have to rise to the challenge then... Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene. Kudo: Hmph! So what? Phoenix: Look carefully at the table. The vase is there... intact! Kudo: Huh? Phoenix: Lost your tongue, granddad? Kudo: ... I'm no granddad of yours, hop scotch! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Judge: Enough! If you throw any more seeds in this courtroom, the cleaners will be here all night. Kudo: Aaaaaah! Judge: ... What is it now? Kudo: I just remembered something! Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Go on... Kudo: The broken vase... Ha ha! It was on my table! Phoenix: Wha...? Kudo: Ah, well... You see... It startled me when that young lad collapsed. So I stood up. That must've been when it fell over. The vase on my table, I mean. Judge: The vase on your table? Kudo: Ah ha ha! Yes, it was on my table! And that's how my groin came to be completely soaked. ......... Judge: *sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today. Kudo: Er, I'd like to ask a question now. Have I, er... Have I been any use at all? Judge: Perhaps that's something you should reflect on yourself, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Aaaargh! WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else... Judge: Bailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom! Kudo: WAAAIT! LISTEN TO MEEEEEE! Judge: Well! We seem to have been considerably sidetracked. And I am still not in a position to deliver a verdict. Phoenix: ...! Judge: The defendant has not been positively identified as the waitress in question. Additionally, there are two disparities in the testimony we have heard thus far. Phoenix: The mark on the coffee cup that the victim supposedly drank from with his left hand. And the earpiece which was inserted into his left ear, out of which he couldn't hear. Maya: Wow, Nick! You did it! Judge: I therefore require both the defense and the prosecution to further investigate the facts. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Godot: ... Judge: There is one more thing before I call today's session to an end. Phoenix: O-One more thing, Your Honor? Judge: The witness we just heard from... He is most insistent that his testimony should be of use. So he's summarized it accordingly into this statement. Phoenix: Um... OK... Judge: You may each have a copy of it, if you wish. Godot: Whatever. The prosecution doesn't need props like that. Maya: Godot's really mad, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. I would be, too. Judge: Very well. Here you are then, Mr. Wright. There are 3 copies. My own, yours, and Mr. Godot's. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Victor's Testimony added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (\"I'm sorry\"? This isn't a piece of testimony! More like a five year old's apology...) Maya: What the heck are we supposed to do with 3 copies...? Judge: That is all. This court is adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned! Recipe for Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 January 7, 12:52 PMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: So how do you think the trial went this morning? Phoenix: How do you think it went!? Maya: It got a bit crazy in there. I just wonder if that killed our chances. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess it did get out of hand. Mr. Kudo's testimony did nothing to help us. Plus, now we don't even know the identity of the waitress who laced the coffee. Maya: All we know is what old Mr. Kudo saw... The apron straps, and the ribbon. Phoenix: And that the victim was wearing an earpiece when his eardrum was ruptured. Maya: Talk about a terrifying case of contradictionitus. Phoenix: Time to play doctor and find ourselves a cure then, huh? Maya: Yeah, we've gotta find one for Maggey, or she's going to have a terminal case of guilty! Talk What to do Phoenix: Well? I'm officially at a loss as to where to start. Maya: Yeah, me too. Let's try some brainstorming. You go first. Phoenix: I guess we should try to put Mr. Kudo's testimony to some sort of use. Maya: Yeah, that's true. Phoenix: And we need to figure out the identity of the waitress and who the victim really was... Somehow, I think the key to this case has got to be at Trés Bien. Maya: Well then, let's go back there and check it out again. Oh! And we should drop in on Maggey and see how she's doing, too. Any ideas Phoenix: So... Anything on your mind? Maya: Actually, there is something... Phoenix: ...? Maya: I was wondering about Xin Eohp... You know, like what he's like and stuff. Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I almost forgot about that guy. ???: I atta beat you so hard, it'll feel like youse were smoochin' the express train! ???: Phoenix Wright? Youse sayin' YOU' Phoenix Wright? ???: Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only! Phoenix: Actually... I've learned a little something about my doppelganger. Maya: Huh? You did? What did you find out? Phoenix: (Oh, yeah, Maya was working at the restaurant when I ran into Don Foneeonay...) Let's just say he was such a terrible version of me that I wanted to sue for defamation! (What's that guy's story, anyway? What does he have to gain by impersonating me?) Present Attorney's Badge Maya: That badge is totally useless, Nick. Phoenix: Huh!? Maya: I mean, no one suspected that Xin Eohp wasn't a real lawyer. I bet he didn't have an attorney's badge! Phoenix: ...I guess you're right. Maya: Or maybe he did have one! And maybe he switched your real one for a \"fugazzi\"! Phoenix: My badge? A fake!? ... Ha ha ha... That's a good one, Maya... Maya: Why the nervous laughter? ...Aha! I knew it! Your badge really IS fake, isn't it Nick? Sports Paper Maya: This doodle here... It was drawn by the victim, right? Phoenix: This is a newspaper from the day of the incident, so, yeah, we've got to assume so. There must be a clue in there somewhere. Maya: I guess we should show it around and see if anyone can tell us more about it. Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe there's a fake Nick running around. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. What's the deal with that? Why's he impersonating me? Maya: Maybe he's got something against you. People do tend to have a distinct distaste for you, Nick. Phoenix: (True enough... The only thing prosecutors seem to like about me is pushing me around...) Maya: Or... maybe he's got something against Maggey. Phoenix: (So he pretended to be me to get Maggey convicted?) Scooter Maya: That thing must've been in an accident. It's a total wreck! Phoenix: That's what the guy I met at the park was riding. And I'm betting he's the fake me. ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only! Phoenix: His voice is still ringing in my ears. Maya: Introduce me next time, Nick! I want to meet Xin Eohp, too! Jean's Loan Contract Maya: A loan of half a million dollars! I wonder what Mr. Armstrong did to get into that much debt. Phoenix: I'm going to guess he spent money needlessly. You'd better watch your spending, too. Maya: Hey, I've got a great idea! What if Mr. Armstrong charged $20,000 for the Twin-T set? Phoenix: If you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back! Victor's Testimony Maya: A letter of apology from the old man? Aww, how sweet. Phoenix: Actually, it's his \"testimony\"... If you can call it that. Maya: So? What's it say? ...\"I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry.\"? Heh heh! I used to break things all the time when I was little, you know. And I used to have to write apologies all the time, too. Phoenix: (Well, Pearls and Adrian seem to have picked up where you left off...) Coffee Cup Maya: That's the cup the poison was in, isn't it? Phoenix: Yeah, and the stain on the rim shows that the victim used his right hand to pick it up. Maya: But the old man swore he saw the victim pick it up with his left hand... Phoenix: (If Mr. Kudo wasn't mistaken, then what could account for this contradiction...?) Victim's Lottery Ticket Maya: Maybe I should try the lottery sometime, too. Phoenix: Sure, why not? If you hit the jackpot, you could win half a million bucks. Maya: So, what are you waiting for, Nick? Buy one! Phoenix: No way! Don't you know the lottery is a tax on people who are bad at math! Maya: Blah. Fine then. At least I can add it to the newly renamed \"Paths to Wealth\"! I'll have to call Pearly later and have her add, \"Buy lottery tickets whenever possible.\" Apron Maya: It's almost surreal that this artsy apron is what got us this far. Phoenix: Well, as art goes, this piece definitely leaves an impression. Maya: I guess that means the old guy never saw the front of it, huh? Which means he didn't see the waitress's face, either... Potassium Cyanide Maya: I can't believe they found this in Maggey's pocket. Phoenix: Yeah, but she was passed out, right? So the killer could've easily planted it on her. Maya: Where do you even get a hold of something like this? It's not like you can go down to your local CostMo' and buy it in bulk for $5 a pound! Phoenix: (She has got a point... How the killer got a hold of this poison is pretty important.) Victim's Prescription Bag Maya: \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\". Hmm... I guess if your eardrum was ruptured, you couldn't listen to the radio, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. It'd be pretty pointless to wear an earpiece of any kind. Maya: The medication in the bag is missing too, right? Phoenix: (The mysterious vanishing medication... Much like our mysterious \"other person\"...) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since then. I think Mia said it's because Maya's \"at a loss these days\"...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia really bailed me out again yesterday. Maya: Argh! That seedy old man was so rude to me! He didn't realize just how awesome I am. If he had, I bet he would've treated me better. Phoenix: Since when did you become so awesome? Godot profile Maya: Godot got it good today, huh? He was even smoking at me end there! Phoenix: He'll have a new witness ready for tomorrow, though. You can count on it. (We need to figure out the facts before then, or we're doomed!) Maggey Byrde profile Maya: A lot of strange conflicting things kept popping up today in the trial, huh? Phoenix: Yeah, and they seemed to come out of nowhere. Maya: That's why we've gotta go talk with Maggey and get out this whole thing straightened out! Phoenix: (Maggey said that when she brought the victim his coffee... ...there was one more people sitting at the table. This single contradiction is probably the most important one we have to resolve...) Glen Elg profile Maya: Have you noticed the victims in our cases tend to be people we know nothing about, Nick? Take Glen Elg, for example. Phoenix: Now that you mention it... Maya: We don't know what kind of guy he was, or why he was killed. I say it's time to get out there and find some answers! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: I really felt sorry for Gumshoe today. He really wanted to help Maggey out, but he kept getting backed into a corner. Phoenix: Maggey took it pretty bad, didn't she? Do you think she feels betrayed? Maya: Maybe. We've got to cheer her up somehow. She's a friend, after all. Phoenix: (A friend? Hmm... Never really thought of it that way, but I guess she is.) Victor Kudo profile Maya: It's the seedy old man! What's his name again? Phoenix: Vermin Kudo, is it? I can't remember, either. I've never seen a witness mess up so badly in court before. Maya: Better stay away from him a while, huh? Phoenix: (Yeah. It might be more than seed that he chucks at me next time.) Jean Armstrong profile Maya: The chef's a witness too, right? Phoenix: I suppose so. He was in the kitchen at the time of the incident. Maya: Well, since Old Man Seeds's testimony is pretty much useless to us... ...I guess we should speak to Mr. Armstrong again, huh? January 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: Looks like Gumshoe's not here. Phoenix: Never mind that. What's going on? It feels different in here somehow... Maya: You think? Phoenix: Yeah. Everyone seems to be on edge. Detective: What are you doing!? Call in the officers for the briefing, quick! Can't you shut down the station's server? Chief! Quit playing on the Internet! Chief: But my e-mail pen pal, 1337aZnPrInceSz! Detective: Save it for later! I'm turning it off NOW! Chief: Noooo! 1337aZnPrInceeeeeSz!! Maya: Everyone's keeping busy in here, huh? Phoenix: Keeping busy? More like panicking, if you ask me. (Something's going on. Something big...) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Even pickpockets can have their pockets picked.\" That's a keeper! Better to go with something that doesn't sound too much like a slogan. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a crime prevention campaign... ...But I'm not sure even he knows what kind of crime he's trying to prevent. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut. Chief: Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to write her a real letter instead of an email. Phoenix: (Alternately, you could write up some reports... Just a suggestion.) Chief: \"Dear 1337aZnPrInceSz, How are you? I'm OK! How was the show last night...?\" Maya: Wow, what an awesome job! Maybe I should send in my resume and become chief! Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\"! Right, Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Um... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: I guess Maggey's still in questioning. Maya: But! But we've got questions to ask her, too! Magg-ey! Magg-ey! Phoenix: Keep it down, Maya! This isn't a playground, you know! January 7Trés Bien Maya: Empty, as usual. Phoenix: Yeah, and it's lunchtime, too. ???: That's it! Come on, come on, come on! Phoenix: Hey, that sounds like... Gumshoe: Now just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can! Maya: He's getting really worked up about something. Gumshoe: Noooooo! That's the wrong number! Argh! Look like an \"8\" would have only netted me five bucks anyway! What a rip off! Maya: What's the problem, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Huh!? Oh, it's you... I, uh... I was uh... Hah hah! I was just... Hah hah hah! I was just listening to the radio, pal. Phoenix: To the radio? Maya: Hey, Detective Gumshoe's having lunch here! Phoenix: (He is! And he's having the Twin-T set...) Gumshoe: Aha ha ha... What can I say...? Examine Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Maya: It could say \"Entrance\" or \"Exit\", too. Did you think of that? Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: Hey, Nick. Do you think Old Seedy was talking about a vase like this today in court? Phoenix: It does look like it's ready to fall over any second. Looks kind of fragile, too. Maya: I bet if Mr. Armstrong charged 10,000 dollars for every vase a customer broke... ...he'd be able to pay off his loan really quickly. Phoenix: If you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got ya! I was just kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Maya: Wow, you really can't see the table in front or behind you at all! It's the perfect setup for slipping poison into your enemy's coffee. Talk Today's trial Gumshoe: This is a nightmare! How am I supposed to look Maggey in the eye now, pal!? Maya: You really drove her into a corner, you know. Gumshoe: You always blow apart my testimony! Why, of all days, didn't you do it today!? Phoenix: S-Sorry... There just weren't any holes in it... for once! Maya: Yeah, what happened? Usually, your testimonies are like Swiss cheese! Gumshoe: S-Swiss cheese...? Phoenix: (Would he have preferred, \"crumbly like aged parmesan\"? Anyway, this case has already been ruled on. There shouldn't be any holes left to find.) Gumshoe: So... Did Maggey say anything to you? About me, I mean. Maya: Well, um... How did she put it again...? Byrde: I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again! Maya: Something like that. Gumshoe: Wah... Waaaaaaaaaah! Maya: P-Please! Detective Gumshoe! I didn't mean... Gumshoe: Why!? Why is this happening!? Maya: He's banging his head against the wall, Nick! Phoenix: (Oh, man... Poor Gumshoe...) Lunch special Phoenix: So, did you like the Twin-T set? Gumshoe: I've never paid that much money for lunch before. I was so nervous, my hands were shaking. Maya: So? How did it taste!? Gumshoe: Well... For 20 bucks, I guess... I dunno how to describe it, really. It was... delicate. Maya: Delicate? Phoenix: You mean you liked it!? It didn't taste bad to you? Gumshoe: ... Maya: What's the matter with him? Phoenix: Looks like he's thinking... Gumshoe: ... That's it! I've been trying to think of the right word to describe the taste. I just got it right now... \"Bad\"! That's it. It tasted bad! Phoenix: *sigh* Gumshoe: It's kinda hard to admit it to yourself when you pay 20 bucks though, pal. Phoenix: (Maybe he should've found out about the price AFTER he had finished eating...) Maya: Maybe that's why Glen Elg came here. Maybe he heard about the famous Twin-T set! Phoenix: (Glen Elg, the victim, huh... Which reminds me. We still hardly know anything about the guy.) Maya: Why don't we ask Gumshoe what he knows, seeing as he's here? The radio Maya: So what were you all excited about earlier? Gumshoe: Huh? Phoenix: That's right! You said you were listening to the radio or something. Gumshoe: Oh, that? That was nothing! I-I wasn't excited! Maya: Come on, Detective Gumshoe! You can tell little ol' me! What were you listening to? Gumshoe: N-Nothing, really. It was just the, um... \"Daily Exercise Show\"! 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (What the...!? A Psyche-Lock?) Gumshoe: Hah hah hah! Mmm... This lunch special's lobster is great! Maya: Then why are there tears in your eyes...? The radio (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Lock) Maya: Come on, Detective Gumshoe. You can tell us what you were listening to on the radio. Gumshoe: But I already told you. It was the, um... the... weather forecast, pal. Phoenix: (Didn't you say it was an exercise program earlier!?) 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Gumshoe: It was nothing, really. Hah hah hah! Phoenix: (Even if it's nothing, the fact that he's hiding it makes me really curious!) The radio (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Gumshoe: I'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try. Phoenix: What's with everyone and the lottery...? Maya: So? How did it go? Gumshoe: I won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad! Phoenix: (Yeah, I know the feeling.) Gumshoe: I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg, see. (Changed from [I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg.] in the original release) And they've got this special radio show where they announce the winning numbers. (Changed from [When they read those results out on the radio, it really gets your heart pumping!] in the original release) They even do the drawings live on the air! It's intense, pal! (Changed from [You know they broadcast it live when they're picking the numbers? It's intense, pal!] in the original release) Maya: I bet that's what Mr. Elg was listening to on the day he was killed. (Changed from [I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.] in the original release) Phoenix: Yeah. What time is it now? Gumshoe: Uh, it's... It's just after 1:30. Phoenix: And are the lottery results always broadcast at the same time? Gumshoe: Yeah. Look, I got this flyer when I bought the ticket. Millionaire Radio Flyer added to the Court Record. Maya: \"Millionaire Radio\"? That sounds cool! I want to try it, Nick! Phoenix: Then buy a ticket, Maya. With your own money! The radio (subsequent times) Gumshoe: I'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try. Phoenix: What's with everyone and the lottery...? Maya: So? How did it go? Gumshoe: I won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad! Phoenix: (Yeah, I know the feeling.) Gumshoe: I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg, see. (Changed from [I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg.] in the original release) And they've got this special radio show where they announce the winning numbers. (Changed from [When they read those results out on the radio, it really gets your heart pumping!] in the original release) They even do the drawings live on the air! It's intense, pal! (Changed from [You know they broadcast it live when they're picking the numbers? It's intense, pal!] in the original release) Maya: I bet that's what Mr. Elg was listening to on the day he was killed. (Changed from [I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.] in the original release) I want to try it, Nick! Phoenix: Then buy a ticket, Maya. With your own money! Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? Gumshoe: It tells me the guy is cruising for a bruising! Maya: You're really caring, aren't you, Detective Gumshoe? About Maggey, I mean. Magatama (after clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, before breaking Psyche-Lock) Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- The Radio -- Phoenix: Alright, Detective Gumshoe, tell me the truth. What were you listening to? Gumshoe: No way, pal. Now that you've made a big thing out of it, I'm not gonna tell you... Phoenix: We'll see about that, pal. Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening... ...it's pretty clear what kind of radio program it was. I'd say it was related to... Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm right, aren't I?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Detective Gumshoe!? Gumshoe: Yeah! That's it, pal! You got me. You sure are something! Phoenix: (Then how come I'm still seeing the lock? Guess I was wrong... Now, what was it he shouting when he was listening to the radio...?) Gumshoe: That's it! Come on, come on, come on! Gumshoe: Now just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can! Gumshoe: Noooooo! That's the wrong number! Phoenix: (It seems so obvious... I'd better ask him again.) Gumshoe: D-Don't tell me you're not through yet... Leads back to: \"Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening...\" Phoenix: I'm right, aren't I? You were listening to the lottery results, weren't you? You thought you'd try to win big, just like Glen Elg did! Gumshoe: I-It's... It's like you can see right through me! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (Huh? I've cracked him already...?) Gumshoe: That's why I said it was nothing! Unlock Successful Sports Paper Gumshoe: That's the sports paper the victim wrote something in, right? ... Maya: What is it? Gumshoe: I know I've heard that name somewhere before... \"MC Bomber\"... Yeah... I heard it real recently, too... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Lunch Special Gumshoe: I haven't got anything to say about that, pal. ... Just take it away already, please? Phoenix: (Spending 20 dollars on this has got to be killing him inside...) Scooter Gumshoe: Hey! Are you putting this up for sale, pal? Phoenix: N-No! Why, would you want a busted up scooter like this anyway? Maya: Yeah. Plus, the seat's all covered in pigeon poop! Gumshoe: Who cares? If it runs, that's all that matters to me. Phoenix: (My phony was riding this bike... Maybe if I head back to the park. it'll be there again.) Victim's Lottery Ticket Gumshoe: A one-way ticket to happiness, huh? Phoenix: Glen Elg died because of this ticket. Gumshoe: Yeah, but it's still a one-way ticket to happiness, pal. Phoenix: And Maggey was found guilty of murder because of it, too. Gumshoe: ... Maya: ...Looks like anything about Maggey is an instant conversation stopper. Phoenix: Yeah. He's got a real soft spot for her, and it obviously hurts when you hit it! Apron Gumshoe: That's the apron Maggey was wearing. Yeah, it still smells like her, too. Maya: Does this mean Maggey smells like ketchup? Victim's Prescription Bag Gumshoe: We never did find the contents of that bag. Maya: It was medicine for Mr. Elg's ruptured eardrum, right? Gumshoe: Yeah. We found traces of it in his left ear canal. He must've used it while he was at Trés Bien. We're sure of that much. Millionaire Radio Flyer Gumshoe: Apparently everyone's listening to this show now. Maya: That's because everyone wants money. Gumshoe: They say that the victim, Glen Elg, was really into gambling. Maya: Yep. You can't beat gambling! I love it, too! I won 500 dollars last night playing cards with Nick. Phoenix: Huh? We were playing for money!? Maya: Of course! So you'd better pay up! Gumshoe: You're a smart one! ...Waiting for a cop to be present before asking for the cash! Godot profile Gumshoe: Mr. Godot agreed to take this case just so he could face you, pal. He was working on a bunch of more important cases, but he cancelled them all... Maya: Huh? But then... ...why didn't Mr. Godot take this case... ...when Maggey's first trial came up? Phoenix: Yeah. that is kinda odd. I mean, everyone thought the defense was \"Phoenix Wright\". So why didn't he try to fight \"me\" then? Gumshoe: Well, according to Mr. Godot... ...he knew the guy was a phony right away, so he didn't want to bother with the trial. Phoenix: (He couldn't be bothered to tell the judge!?) Maggey Byrde profile Gumshoe: Maggey's probably crying all alone right now, huh... Maya: Yeah, thanks to you. Gumshoe: Aaaaaaargh! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! Phoenix: Maya! Don't torch poor Gumshoe feelings like they're are some sort of cheap crème brûlée! Maya: You're really crazy about Maggey, aren't you? Gumshoe: No! No, no! I'm just... I'm not... It's not that I... Phoenix: (You don't have to hide it, Gumshoe! It's pretty obvious.) Maya: Yeah, you're way too plain-looking for Maggey. Right? Gumshoe: I'd arrest you right now if you weren't so right... Glen Elg profile Gumshoe: This guy was a real programming genius. They called him \"the walking computer\" at the place where he worked. Maya: What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!? Phoenix: (*groan* He wasn't LITERALLY a computer, Maya!) (Changed from [*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!] in the original release) Gumshoe: Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim. Phoenix: Yeah. That's what we found out yesterday, too. Maya: Hey, Detective Gumshoe. Don't you have any information that's a bit more fun? Gumshoe: F-Fun? I, uh... Oh! I know! So, have you paid a visit to where Elg worked yet? You might as well. Maya: His workplace? Where's that? Gumshoe: A computer firm called \"Blue Screens, Inc.\" or something like that. Maya: Sounds like a real stable company. This could be fun, Nick. Let's go! Phoenix: Computers aren't really my thing, Maya. Maya: We'll be fine! I know all about that hi-tech stuff. Phoenix: (I wonder about that...) Gumshoe: It's just around the corner from this joint. You should take a look. Phoenix: (A computer firm called \"Blue Screens, Inc.\" huh...) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I know I look a little rough around the edges. But the truth is, I'm a lot more \"detective-like\" than I used to be. Maya: Really? Like what part? Gumshoe: ...Like the color of my coat. Maya: Ah! You're right! Phoenix: (Yeah, but what about what's inside the coat...?) Victor Kudo profile Gumshoe: You know, in all my years, I've never seen a witness who was that confused before. Phoenix: Yeah, you looked pretty confused by his testimony. Gumshoe: Nothing against old guys, I like them and all... But... He sounded like he was pretty sure about what he saw. Maya: Yeah, that's the impression I got, too! Phoenix: (Me, three... But then, why doesn't even a single part of his testimony corroborate any of the facts?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh lá lá! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Maya: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". But I'll tell you want. This stuff works like a charm. I slept like a rock last night. Phoenix: O-Oh, really... That's nice... Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal... I can't discuss anything connected to the case. Maya: Hey! I thought you said you were going to help us out! Gumshoe: I can't help you out if I don't have any info! Phoenix: Yeah, I suppose the retrial has only just begun... January 7Vitamin Square Maya: Hmm... I don't see any sign of Mr. Kudo. Do you? Phoenix: Maybe he went to buy another ton of bird seeds. I was kind of hoping he wouldn't be here, anyway. At least, not for now. (Besides, any more seeds today and I'm liable to turn into a real phoenix!) Examine Scooter Maya: Hey, check this out... Phoenix: I wouldn't get too close to that if I were you. Otherwise you might be in for a shock. My phony must be lurking someplace nearby... Just imagine! A Tiger, loose in the city! Maya: Meanwhile the real Phoenix is like an abandoned chick, lost in a vast urban jungle! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Don't worry. Someday, you'll grow up and become a ferocious tiger, too! Don't lose hope! Phoenix: (Why is she trying to pep-talk me into becoming my phony...?) Orange Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: Speaking of fun, if we get Maggey acquitted, may be can all get together sometime. Maya: OK! ...But what do we play with someone who's never even won a game of Tic-Tac-Toe? Phoenix: How about we change the rules a bit, then? We could play Old Maid, and... um... We could say the person who's left with the old maid at the end is the winner. How's that? Maya: Not bad... Not bad at all! We could even rename the game to \"Fair Maiden\"! January 7Trés BienKitchen Maya: Huh? Mr. Armstrong's talking to someone. ???: I'll be back next month. Armstrong: Oui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you! ???: If you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here. Armstrong: Non! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise! ???: I love fire, you know... I love the way it crackles... Hee... Hee... Hee... Armstrong: Non, non, non! Stop it! I beg you! ???: Then don't let me down... I'll be watching you... Armstrong: Mais, non! Z'is is not necessary! You can trust me, mademoiselle! ???: Talk to anyone... and I'll drive a knife... right through your heart. Armstrong: Oh, non! You do not 'ave to worry. You know, you worry far too much. Maybe z'is will 'elp you relax. It is la oil of sandalwood. ???: I do love... raw meat... from time to time... Hee... Hee... Hee... Armstrong: Aaaaah! ???: I'll be taking my leave... Goodbye... for now! Armstrong: Urgh! I 'ave la shivers! I must rub some of my oil all over my body before I become z'e nervous wreck! Z'ere. Oh, oui, oui! Z'at feels good! Phoenix: Urgh! Armstrong: Oh là là! Excusez-moi, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My eyes! My EYES! Armstrong: Your eyes? If you 'ave trouble wi'z your eyes, you need z'is. La oil of sandalwood! Phoenix: Isn't this just the leftovers of what you were just using!? Examine Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I ate yesterday for lunch? Maya: Yeah, I think it's been permanently burned into my brain now... ...as an example of what truly awful food tastes like. Phoenix: (I bet it'd taste really good if it was prepared well. ...Balsamy even!) Talk Trés Bien Phoenix: You don't exactly have many customers, do you, Mr. Armstrong? Armstrong: Non, you are right, monsieur. But per'aps z'at is la perfect time for you to visit me, non? Now I can give you my undivided attention, and cook for you la dish suprême! Phoenix: Putting on a brave face, huh? Maya: That's what girls do, Nick! Armstrong: But you are right. Business is very difficult z'ese days. Per'aps ze name is la problem. People do not understand it. Z'ey think it is \"tray\". I just wanted people to think z'at my restaurant was exclusive. Phoenix: But they think you just serve fast food on cheap, plastic trays? Maya: Nick! That's the kind of thing that can make a girl cry! Phoenix: Have you forgotten that Mr. Armstrong is a man, Maya? Armstrong: But z'is restaurant is my life! It is everything to me! I will defend it to la finale! No one will take it from me! The woman just now Phoenix: So who was that woman you were just talking to? Armstrong: Oh lá lá! You saw z'at? Phoenix: Ah, well... Yes. Sorry. Maya: So? Who was she!? She looked so polite and graceful. Armstrong: P-Polite!? G-Graceful!? Maya: And she likes raw meat and fires, right? ???: I'll be back next month. Armstrong: Oui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you! ???: If you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here. Armstrong: Non! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise! Phoenix: (Now that I think about it...) Hey, Maya... I think it's pretty clear what kind of conversation they were having. Maya: You think so? Well, then let's show him that piece of evidence and see what happens! The woman just now (appears after presenting Jean's Loan Contract) Phoenix: The woman who was here earlier... I take it that she's... um... Armstrong: Why 'as it come to z'is...? What a tragedy! Suddenly I find myself so deep in la debt. It is a sign of la bad, bad world we live in, uh? Phoenix: (No. I'd say it's more of a sign of la bad, bad culinary skills...) Armstrong: Z'e woman who was 'ere... Z'e scary woman... She is from la loan office. Phoenix: Loan office? Is that where you borrowed half a million dollars from? Armstrong: Oui. Tender Lender, it is called. Maya: Catchy name. Just hearing it makes me wanna borrow some money. Armstrong: Please! You must not borrow from z'em. If you must, no more z'an ten dollars! Phoenix: Ten dollars? Sounds like your whole monthly stipend, Maya... Maya: Hey! I get a bit more than that, thank you very much! Phoenix: So Tender Lender is the loan office you borrowed half a million from, huh? Maya: I wonder if they've got anything to do with this case... Tender Lender (appears after \"The woman just now\") Armstrong: I am a weak woman. When I am upset, I 'ave to buy something nice to cheer me up. Thanks to 'im loaning me la money, I 'ave to pay back 'alf a million dollars now! I am like 'is slave. I 'ave to do everything z'at 'e tells me. Maya: Um... Who's this he? Armstrong: La Tiger... Maya: The Tiger? Armstrong: Oui. 'E is la manager of z'e Tender Lender. A terrifying man! La big city mobster! When 'e shouts at me, my knees are trembling and 'is voice is ringing in my ears for 3 days! As soon as I 'ear la noise of z'at battered old scooter 'e rides, I start to cry! Phoenix: (A big city mobster who rides a battered old scooter...?) Um, does this guy resemble me by any chance? Armstrong: Oh, non, non, non! Z'is man 'as a presence! A most formidable personality! Although... Oui, 'e does 'ave la spikey 'air just like you. Oui, z'ere is a resemblance z'ere, I suppose. Phoenix: (Hmm... Sounds like this loan office is worth checking out after all...) Armstrong: If you want to visit z'e Tender Lender, it is just beyond Vitamin Square. Maya: Hey, Nick... If you need money, I can loan you some... As long as it's less than 3 dollars... Phoenix: Um... Thanks for the offer... (...Just beyond Vitamin Square, huh?) Present Magatama Armstrong: Oh, what a beautiful pendant! It would look stunning on me w'iz la earrings! Maya: Please don't steal it again, OK? It's one of a kind! Armstrong: I could just 'ave a sliver of it, non? Maya: I-It's not a block of cheese, you know! Sports Paper Phoenix: This is the paper the victim brought with him. Armstrong: \"MC Bomber\"...? Oui... Maya: Does that mean something to you? Armstrong: Non, I only speak French, mademoiselle. Maya: But we found it behind your magazine rack... Armstrong: Oh, 'ow naughty I am! I 'aven't cleaned for such a long time! Lunch Special Armstrong: Oh là là! So you 'ave eaten my lunch, oui? Tell me, monsieur. Did you enjoy la lunch I prepared for you? Phoenix: It was a... unique and... wild mixture of flavors. Maya: That was the first time I ever had lobster, you know! Armstrong: Lobster? Z'ere was no lobster in my lunch... Maya: Huh? But, it said, \"lobster\" right on the menu. Armstrong: Mademoiselle Maya. Please, you must read la menu more carefully. It says, \"A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with a balsamic vinaigrette. Maya: Oh. It's \"inspired\", is it? Armstrong: Oui. \"Inspired\" by z'ese ingredients, but not per'aps made from z'em, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Well, guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, Nick. Phoenix: (The way the lunch tasted, it's probably 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.) Scooter Armstrong: ... Maya: What is it? Armstrong: Is z'is your scooter? Phoenix: No, no! I saw it before in Vitamin Square, you see... Armstrong: Mon dieu! Non, non, non! Take it away! Do not show z'at to me! Phoenix: (Talk about an allergic reaction...) Jean's Loan Contract Armstrong: So long as z'at paper exists, I am but a delightful angel w'iz la broken wings! Maya: An angel, huh...? Doesn't bode well, when you think about it... Armstrong: Oui! Z'ey kept 'arassing me month after month. In z'e end, I 'ad to give in. I agreed to 'elp z'em. Maya: Help them? With what? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr, if I did not owe z'em la money, I would 'ave refused. But my 'ands were tied! Phoenix: Please! What did you agree to help them with? Armstrong: Non. I-I cannot say! If I tell you, z'at woman, she will slice me up... ...and eat me w'iz la salad garnish! Phoenix: (Eww! I hope he doesn't mean that he'll literally be sliced up and served with garnish...) I'm going to guess that woman has something to do with your loan contract. Am I right? Armstrong: Ah! Maya: Please, Mr. Armstrong, tell us about that woman! Victor's Testimony Armstrong: Ah, it is true. My vases are broken all z'e time. I bought a new one z'e next day after la incident. But z'ey wouldn't let me put it on la table because of la investigation. Victim's Lottery Ticket Armstrong: If only I 'ad taken z'e right lottery ticket... I would not 'ave any debts right now. I would be free! Maya: Look on the right side, Mr. Armstrong. You won a dollar, right? Phoenix: (A lack of remorse for having stolen something: Priceless.) Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: You 'ave la perfect face for a waitress, you know. Maya: Um, thanks. I guess if things don't work out someday, then maybe I'll be back. Phoenix: (What things? Is she talking about her being a spirit medium...?) Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Oh, 'ow it 'urts me to see z'at poor girl's face! Phoenix: Maggey's? Armstrong: I 'eard she was super'umanly un'appy. Maya: Superhumanly...? Armstrong: And if she 'adn't come to work for me, she wouldn't 'ave got into z'is mess. Phoenix: (Huh? I'm missing something here, aren't I?) Armstrong: Je suis désolé, Maggey! Forgive me! After presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien: January 7Blue Screens, Inc. Maya: Wow! This place is so hi-tech! You can almost smell the electricity in the air! Phoenix: It is a computer firm, Maya. They can't work without electricity, you know. ???: Who are you? Maya: Oh, umm... Hello... ???: I'm sorry. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only. This is a computer programming laboratory. There are far too many trade secrets that could be leaked. Maya: Wow! What secrets!? ???: Everything you see here is classified. No information can leave this building. Maya: Understood! Phoenix: (Who is this woman? She's like a robot from some kind of whacked edumacational show...) Basil: My name is Lisa Basil. I'm the company director. Phoenix: D-Director!? (Sh-She's human!? She seems more like a ghost in a shell. And that thing over her eye... Isn't that the same device as Glen Elg's?) Maya: That's an [sic] DMH, right? Phoenix: Nice try, but it's the other way around, Maya. It's an HMD. Basil: All of my programmers here at Blue Screens, Inc. are supplied with HMDs. Maya: Then do you write programs, too? Basil: No. I just enjoy wearing this. Maya: They ARE pretty cool! I wouldn't mind one! Examine Pillars Phoenix: Those pillars almost look like they're moving. It's kind of unsettling. Maya: Nah, they just look a bit twisted or warped or whatever word I'm looking for... Basil: This office was designed with a futuristic feel in mind. Maya: Futuristic? Basil: Yes. We tried to imagine what things might look like in the future when we designed it. It helps to soothe and calm the soul. Maya: ... On second thought, I agree with you, Nick. This place is really unsettling. Super computer Maya: Hey, look Nick! It's a super-computer! It looks like it's really smart and wise, doesn't it? Phoenix: Computers are only as smart as the humans who use them, Maya. Maya: That explains why we don't use the computer in our office! Phoenix: You work there too, Maya. Maya: Yeah, but at least I'm... Basil: Please. Don't argue about something that's so trivial. Otherwise the computer will laugh at you. Maya: She said she'd laugh at us, Nick. Phoenix: (She's a human, Maya, not a computer!) Programmers Phoenix: He's really pounding that keyboard, isn't he? Maya: Wow! I bet that's where the \"pro\" in \"programmer\" comes from, huh? I guess I shouldn't be resting on my laurels. Gotta expand my skill set and all that. Phoenix: Yeah, that's a good idea. Maya: Maybe I could become Old Seedy's apprentice. Phoenix: (Um... And what about your spirit medium training?) Tickets on floor Maya: Wow! Look at this mess! Phoenix: Looks like they're all betting tickets. Maya: What kind of betting tickets? Phoenix: For betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets. Maya: Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these... Phoenix: (Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.) Glen Elg's Losing Horse Racing Tickets gathered up. Maya: This many tickets would get you... what? A buck down at the recycling center? But I didn't know you were so hard up that you'd try to profit from the dead, Nick. (Changed from [You're hopeless, Nick. You know that?] in the original release) Phoenix: (I'm just taking them as evidence, Maya!) Tickets on floor (subsequent times) Maya: Wow! Look at this mess! Phoenix: Looks like they're all betting tickets. Maya: What kind of betting tickets? Phoenix: For betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets. Maya: Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these... Phoenix: (Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.) Horse calendar Maya: Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess! Phoenix: Looks pretty average to me. Maya: But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this. Phoenix: You think? Real whiz-kids can work under any condition, you know. Maya: ...! Phoenix: (She's trying to hint that I should tidy my desk more. I'll clean up my desk when Maya stops asking silly questions... No hurry then.) Maya: Hey! This calendar... Phoenix: What about it...? If this is another hint about tidying, you can forget it. Maya: Someone's marked December 3rd in red pen! Phoenix: December 3rd? That's the day Mr. Elg was murdered! Is there anything else? Maya: Yeah. Umm... It says, \"Meet with The Tiger.\" Phoenix: The T-Tiger? Glen's Calendar added to the Court Record. Horse calendar (subsequent times) Maya: Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess! Phoenix: Looks pretty average to me. Maya: But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this. Phoenix: You think? Real whiz-kids can work under any condition, you know. Maya: ...! Phoenix: (She's trying to hint that I should tidy my desk more. I'll clean up my desk when Maya stops asking silly questions... No hurry then.) Talk Blue Screens, Inc. Phoenix: So... What exactly is this firm's business? Basil: I will try to simplify it so that you can understand... We analyze the data management systems required by certain branches of industry... ...and deliver optimum operating system and source-level components. Maya: Huh? You lost me on the corner of Analyze and Management. Phoenix: It doesn't matter. They analyze stuff. You got that much, right? Basil: The software we produce is distributed on CDs. Maya: CDs...? Basil: Yes. Compact disc. Digital optical storage media. Phoenix: (Of course, CDs are used for software as well as music...) Basil: It is a small firm, but all of my employees are first-class programmers. Let's ask one of them what they are doing. Excuse me. What are you working on right now? Programmer: I'm researching the impact of time-slicing common areas in multi-threaded code on logical access to shared global variables. Obviously, program structure heavily influences response time and performance, so the co-independence of global variables and memory overheads is vitally important to the success of the execution. Basil: Well, you get the idea. This is the sort of thing we are involved in. Did you good people follow all of that? Maya: Y-Y-Yeah... Phoenix: (Your blank smile just said otherwise, Maya.) What happened Phoenix: You know about what happened, right, Ms. Basil? Basil: You mean about Glen being poisoned? Yes, I know. It's terrible. Maya: Can you tell us anything that might be helpful? Basil: I don't think so. A police officer was here earlier, too. But I couldn't tell him anything either, because... ...the waitress who committed the crime has nothing to do with Blue Screens, Inc. Maya: Oh... Phoenix: How about Mr. Elg's desk? Have you cleared it out already? Basil: No, not yet. It's the one, right in front of you. If there's anything that might be useful to you, you are welcome to take it. Phoenix: (I guess there might be a clue here somewhere...) Glen's troubles (appears after presenting Glen Elg profile) Phoenix: Um, about Mr. Elg... Was he in some kind of trouble? Basil: I'm sorry? Why would you think that? Phoenix: I thought you said something about it just now? You said he got himself into trouble because he was a bit of a \"loser\". Basil: ... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Three Psyche-Locks?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock?] in the original release) Maya: I guess Mr. Elg is like every other man with his pile of secrets. Glen's troubles (subsequent times) Phoenix: Please tell us more about the trouble that Mr. Elg was in. Basil: I'm sorry. I don't know anything about that. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Basil: I do not pry into other people's affairs. Maya: She just gave us the dreaded \"professional, business-like cold-shoulder\", huh? Phoenix: (I need to find out exactly what the victim was involved in. Looks like I've got to break her in a \"professional, business-like\" manner!) Present Glen Elg profile Phoenix: Um, about Mr. Elg... Basil: He was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. But he did suffer from one or two bugs in his personality. Maya: Oh? Like what? Basil: He was a bit of a \"loser\"... Perhaps that would be the best way to describe it. That's what got him into trouble... ... Maya: What's the matter? Basil: He was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. So he was really no trouble at all. A model employee. Phoenix: Hey, wait a minute! Just now you said something about him being in trouble! (We've got to find out what this trouble was exactly.) Anything else Maya: Umm, would you mind taking a look at this? Basil: I'm sorry. That data is SuPer-Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected. Maya: SuPer Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected!? What!? This is madness! Phoenix: No, Maya. That is SPARDA. She won't tell us unless we say the right code word. Maya: A code word? Hmm... ... Sesame! Basil: ... Maya: If it's not \"sesame\", then it must be her mother's maiden name. That's how it always is. Phoenix: There's no point in having a password if it's always the same thing, Maya. (I guess she just doesn't want to talk about this.) Maya: Maybe we should focus on asking about Glen Elg. What do you say? Trés Bien Present Lisa Basil profile Gumshoe: That lady is the boss of Blue Screens, Inc., pal. Yeah... I figure she's clean. She got nothing to hide. She seemed kinda like a doll to me. In a good way and a bad way. ... Kinda makes you think she might be hiding something. Trés Bien (after breaking Psyche-Lock, then clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien, and clearing \"Tender Lender\" Talk option in Trés Bien - Kitchen) Gumshoe: Well, I'm gonna head back to the precinct now. We've got a big meeting starting in a bit. Maya: About Maggey's case, you mean? Gumshoe: No, that's pretty much wrapped up now... There's another big case going down at the moment, so she's been pushed aside... Maya: OK. Well, see you later then. Gumshoe: Bye! Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... Phoenix: ......... Y-You better get going, Detective, or you'll be late. Gumshoe: Actually, I, um... I've kinda got a favor to ask. It's a big one! Phoenix: A favor? Gumshoe: Yeah... It's for, um... Maggey, actually. I was kinda hoping... you'd give this to her for me. Maya: What is it? Gumshoe: It's a lunchbox. I got up early so I could make it. I've been real worried about her. She looked like she'd lost a lot of weight. Maya: Detective Gumshoe... ... How many weenies are in here!? There's not a person on earth who could down this much meat. Gumshoe: You think? I love weenies. I can't get enough of their tender juiciness. So will you give to her? It took me ages to make, so please say you will, pal! Phoenix: (I can't exactly say no, can I?) Gumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya to carry. Maya: Maybe I'll eat it myself if I get hungry! Gumshoe: Don't forget, OK? I'm counting on you to give that to Maggey. Phoenix: (He's finally gone...) January 7Tender Lender Maya: ...This place gives off a really strange vibe, doesn't it? Phoenix: Looks like \"The Tiger\" isn't in his lair. (And that is, as they say, a very good thing.) ???: ...Welcome... Phoenix: *gulp* (Talk about a creepy voice! It makes your soul want to shrivel up and die!) ???: You're here... to discuss a loan...? Phoenix: Uh, no. Not exactly... ???: The manager is away at the moment... Wait quietly... please... Maya: She's gone! Just like that! Phoenix: I guess we'll just have to come back another time. Maya: But this is the perfect opportunity, Nick! This place reeks of suspicion! Come on, Nick! Let's take a look around, OK? Phoenix: Do you think it'd be OK...? Maya: Of course! No one will ever know... ???: ...Coffee...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll leave it here for you to enjoy... Quietly. Phoenix: Y-Yes! Thank you! ???: Do not touch the desk... Please... Maya: N-N-Nick! Let's g-get out of here! Phoenix: (NOW she wants to get out of here...) Examine Desk on rug Phoenix: That's one impressive desk on one impressive rug! Maya: It's solid gold, Nick! Gold! Just look at that shine! Only real gold shines like that. Phoenix: Would you really want such a shiny desk, though? Maya: I don't know, but let's see what it's like to sit at a solid gold desk... Wow! I'm completely dazzled! Phoenix: That's because it's completely dazzling! Maya: I can see up my nose in the reflection! That's gotta be really distracting! Phoenix: (So the desk isn't practical. No surprise there.) Punching bag Maya: What's this? Phoenix: It's a punching bag. Maya: What!? No way. You wouldn't catch me walking around with a bag like that! Phoenix: What do you mean, \"walking around\"? Maya: The design's gross to start with, and it's way too heavy to be practical. And why's it called a \"punching\"-bag? Don't people know messenger bags are in! I knew it. I was right before, back at Trés Bien. Paris fashion is more my thing. Phoenix: (I really, really hope she's pulling my chain on this one.) CD player Phoenix: There's a CD player on the desk. But the desk is so loud, it's a wonder you can hear it. Maya: The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into. ???: Have you finished... ...the coffee? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Y-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely. ???: ... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... *gulp* ???: ...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup... Phoenix: (Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!) Maya: Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast... Phoenix: I-I sure hope so... (We better take a look at that CD while we're still alive and have the chance...) What the...!? Maya: What!? It's not the Rocko soundtrack, is it? Claw of the Tiger? Phoenix: It's... It's a demo CD... The artist's name has been hand-written on the disc in pen. \"MC Bomber\"... Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (This must be the CD Maggey told us about!) Maya: Let's listen to it! I bet it's heavy metal! Phoenix: No way! That woman'll make us drink more coffee if we do! MC Bomber added to the Court Record. CD player (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a CD player on the desk. But the desk is so loud, it's a wonder you can hear it. Maya: The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into. ???: Have you finished... ...the coffee? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Y-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely. ???: ... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... *gulp* ???: ...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup... Phoenix: (Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!) Maya: Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast... Phoenix: I-I sure hope so... Items on bookshelf Maya: Let's see... This round doll thing is called a \"daruma\"... I think. I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering. Phoenix: You mean you aren't making stuff up for a change? Maya: Heh. I bet you also didn't know that no matter what, he'll always right himself. Go on, Nick! Give him a good shove! Phoenix: Only if I feel like dying! Maya: Now, this yellow thing... This is a Japanese chess piece. I think it's a \"king\"? Not that I'm an expert or anything... I'm more of a Reversi person, you know. Phoenix: (Assuming she knows what she's talking about, these aren't exactly your typical... ...\"mobster wannabe\" items. They're not... \"trophies\", are they...? *gulp*) Maya: Hey... There's a piece of paper sticking out from under here. Phoenix: What is it? ...A repair bill? (Looks like he did some repair work on his car... Does he even have one...?) $15,000 to replace a bumper and a light!? That's insane! Maya: The car's registered to... the \"Cadaverinis\"? Phoenix: Huh? So it's not even The Tiger's car? (Why would someone else's repair bill be in The Tiger's office...?) Repair Bill added to the Court Record. Items on bookshelf (subsequent times) Maya: Let's see... This round doll thing is called a \"daruma\"... I think. I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering. Phoenix: You mean you aren't making stuff up for a change?

They're not... \"trophies\", are they...? *gulp*) Frame Phoenix: \"Win Through Compromise\"...? Maya: I wonder what that's supposed to mean... Phoenix: It must mean something if they took the trouble to frame it like that. Maya: Yeah well, it still doesn't make any sense to me... ???: ...That... Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: That's Tender Lender's guiding principle. Maya: Oh? ???: \"Compromise the customer to win.\" Maya: O-Oh, I see... How about you, Nick...? Phoenix: Yeah, umm... Well, as long as we don't have to compromise my hair, I'd say we're OK... (That's one slogan no business owner should ever explain to their customers... *shudder*) Spilled ashtray Maya: Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up. Phoenix: Yeah. It's all over the rug and everything. Maya: I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal. Phoenix: (How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?) Maya: Oh, hey! There's a book of matches here, too! Phoenix: Matches, huh? Places don't give those out much nowadays. ...Hey, wait a second! Maya: What is it? Phoenix: Look what's printed on its cover! It says, \"Trés Bien\"! (Changed from [Look what's printed on the back! It says, 'Trés Bien'!] in the original release) Trés Bien Matches added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (These matches could come in handy. We might be able to use them...) Maya: Yeah. The pilot light for the office boiler keeps going out. Phoenix: Swing and a miss, Maya. Swing and a miss. Spilled ashtray (subsequent times) Maya: Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up. Phoenix: Yeah. It's all over the rug and everything. Maya: I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal. Phoenix: (How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?) Hanging clothes Maya: Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic! Phoenix: (Looks more like a pimp coat to me... Guess I haven't got an eye for fashion.) Maya: Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick. Phoenix: Hmm... The same color as my suit...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Keep your voice down, Maya! Maya: N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this! ???: Some cake...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll just leave it here for you... Maya: Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks... ???: Just wait here quietly... Otherwise... Maya: S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said! Phoenix: Y-Yeah! Sure! ???: I have my eye on you... Only so I can \"take care of you\".... Understand...? Maya: Aah! I'm scared, Nick! Phoenix: ...So? What were you getting so excited about before? Maya: Look, on the lapel of this suit... Phoenix: That's...! That's an attorney's badge! Maya: Is The Tiger a lawyer!? Phoenix: No way! Look at this thing! It's made of paper! (Changed from [No way! Look at this badge! It's made of paper!] in the original release) Paper Badge added to the Court Record. Maya: For some reason, your badge suddenly looks really cheap to me, Nick. Phoenix: (Why doesn't anyone recognize an obviously fake badge when they see one...?) Hanging clothes (subsequent times) Maya: Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic! Phoenix: (Looks more like a pimp coat to me... Guess I haven't got an eye for fashion.)

I'm scared, Nick! After examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes: ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!

Phoenix: (Ack... That voice... It's like evil seeping into your head through your ears...) ???: ...I'm sorry... Don Tigre... I knocked over that ashtray before... and... Phoenix: (Eek! Has she got a death wish or what!?) The Tiger: ... Oh, right. Phoenix: Huh? The Tiger: F-Forget about it, Violetta. I-It's noddin'... Phoenix: (What, what, what!?) The Tiger: I ain't gonna get mad at you. You' too cute, you hear! Phoenix: (That's so unfair!) ???: Here... Have some cookies... I just baked them... And you'll need some strong espresso... while you're discussing your loan... The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: Y-Yes!? The Tiger: Youse either crazy or just plain stupid to chase after me! I worked so hard, but now youse gotta come and mess up my plan... Phoenix: (So it was him... He's my phony...) The Tiger: Heh, but I don't care. No one gets in my way! Phoenix: Wh-What? I mean, e-excuse me? The Tiger: Heh heh heh! Youse shoulda left de little girl at home, Wright. Phoenix: Um... I have a few things I want to ask-- The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! The Tiger: No questions! Dis is de last time we meet! Phoenix: Ack! Wait! P-Please! Maya: ...That was pretty weak, Nick. You waited until he was out of earshot before you shouted after him. Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk! I didn't hear you scream, \"Hold it!\" either!) ???: ...The espresso... Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: ...And cookies... Phoenix: (This woman is definitely not good for my heart. Now, what was it The Tiger called her...? \"Violetta\"?) Talk Tender Lender Phoenix: So... I'm kind of curious about your company, Tender Lender... Violetta: ...With the warm and friendly atmosphere you'd expect from a family-sized business... ...a conscientious rate of interest... and an attractive repayment policy... Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling this sentence is not going to end well...?) Violetta: ...we will tenderly lend you that little bit extra, here at Tender Lender. Maya: Hey, Nick. Things are a bit tight for Wright and Co. at the moment, aren't they? I mean there's that 500 dollars you owe me from our card game for starters. Why don't you take out a loan? Phoenix: (Would I like to take out a loan from a place like this? Not so much...) Violetta: Tender Lender is... on your side... Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: So, um, let's say I'm late with my repayment... What happens then? Violetta: ...We'd give you more coffee... ...Strong coffee... Phoenix: Um, right... I think I'd rather skip down! Maya: Hey! Just remember I can make strong coffee too, Nick! Strong tea, as well! What happened Phoenix: So, um, do you know about the incident we're investigating? Violetta: What incident...? Maya: Well, a man was poisoned in a restaurant just near here. That incident. Violetta: Let me see... I was here that day, with the manager... Phoenix: The manager being The Tiger...? Violetta: ...Furio Tigre... Maya: F-Furio... Phoenix: ...T-Tigre? (So that's where the \"Tiger\" thing comes from...) Maya: Xin Eohp's got a real name! Nick! Hurry up and find out more about him! Saved your life? (appears after presenting Furio Tigre profile) Violetta: I'm very... frail, you see... Just recently, I... died... Once... Hee... Hee... Maya: You d-died!? Violetta: About 4 months ago... The doctors said to... abandon all hope... Phoenix: (I guess they were expecting her to take a boat ride across the River Styx.) Violetta: But Don Tigre... He saved me. He gave up everything... Maya: Everything!? Violetta: When I found out what he had done for me, I... was happy... Maya: No offense, but I'm finding that a little hard to believe. Violetta: I decided I'd pay him back... with my life... by serving him coffee... and espresso... Phoenix: (I still wonder about what's in her coffee...) So... is that why you've got that bandage around your head? Violetta: Hee... Hee... Hee... This? The head bandage (appears after \"Saved your life?\") Phoenix: Um, so what's the story with the bandage? Violetta: ... They put it on after the operation... Maya: Operation? Violetta: It's just a little injury... A little, fatal, injury... Hee... Hee... Hee... Maya: A f-f-fatal injury!? Phoenix: (Maya just suffered one herself, by the sound of it...) So, that's the injury you were talking about before when you said you had died once? Violetta: ... 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: ...! Maya: Urgh! She really creeps me out, Nick! Phoenix: (Same here. But we've got to find out the truth!) The head bandage (subsequent times) Violetta: It was very complicated... The operation... They opened up my head... And performed surgery on my frontal lobe... Maya: Urgh! Just thinking about it sends shivers down my spine! Phoenix: So how did you get this \"fatal injury\" that left you needing an operation? 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Violetta: I made a promise to Don Tigre... I said I would never tell... Cross my heart and hope to drink 100 cups of espresso... Phoenix: Oh. (That much caffeine would raise anyone from the dead!) Violetta: Besides... It's a very precious memory to me... Phoenix: A... A precious memory...? (I'll never find out what she means if I can't break her...) Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Can I ask you about The Tiger, I mean, Mr. Tigre? Violetta: ...Cookie...? Maya: S-Sure...? Violetta: How do you like my cookies? I baked them myself... Hee... Hee... Hee... Maya: Go ahead, Nick! The honor is all yours! Phoenix: No, no! Ladies first, Maya! Violetta: Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: (No matter how I look at this, I just don't get it... What are The Tiger and this scary girl doing working together?) Violetta: We... are lovers... Phoenix: (That's not exactly coming across in your tone of voice...) Violetta: And I owe Don Tigre my life... He's the one who saved me... Phoenix: The Tiger... saved you...!? Violetta: Please, address him properly as \"Don Tigre\". Otherwise, I'll have to... Phoenix: OK, OK! Don Tigre! Of course! I'm sorry. (He saved her life? I'd sure like to how that happened.) Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Violetta: More coffee...? You must have more... Phoenix: No! Um, thanks! I've had enough. Really! (I'm so thirsty!) Violetta: I don't leave the office... I can't tell you about anything... except Don Tigre. January 7Vitamin Square Maya: There he is! Old Seedy's back feeding the pigeons again! Kudo: There! Take this! And this! And get out of my park! Phoenix: Like I thought, he's really mad... Come on, Maya. Just keep your head down and let's sneak away while we still can... Maya: What? Why? Hellooo, old man! Phoenix: What are you doing, Maya!? Kudo: Huh!? ...Kah! Maya: Hey, he just turned his back on us! Phoenix: I'm not surprised. I bet I really hurt his pride in court this morning. Maya: Hey, Mr. Kudo! Kudo: Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Hmm, pi-pi-pigeon, hmm... Kah! Maya: Look, we really need to talk to you, alright? Kudo: Out with the demons! In with good fortune! Maya: Ow! Ow! Ow! Seeds... Shell splinters... Painful... Phoenix: I always knew you were a demon, Maya! Talk Today's trial Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry about what happened in court earlier today. Kudo: Kah! Everyone'll be talking about me behind my back now! A dirty old man who was so busy looking at the serving girl's backside... ...that he can't remember her face! A filthy, depraved animal! Phoenix: N-Not at all! Kudo: Are you listening to me, boy!? I don't care what you say, I saw that waitress put it in! She put some white powder into the young lad's javaccino! Maya: We hear you... Kudo: And another thing! The young layabout was wearing an earpiece! On the same side as the lens of his broken spectacles! Maya: W-We're really sorry... Kudo: So I made a little mistake about the vase. So what!? I know what I saw! I tell you, I tell you, I tell you! Phoenix: OK, OK! Take it easy, please, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Don't tell me to take it easy, you spikey-haired brat! Take this! Embroiderer Maya: Um... You said you were a craftsman, right? Kudo: Kah! The modern world casts honest craftsmen like me aside in droves! Maya: S-Surely it's not that... Kudo: I come from a long line of craftsmen. Right back to the time of the shoguns! Do you hear me!? I didn't become an embroiderer, I was BORN one! Maya: Actually... I'm kind of in the same situation myself. Kudo: I... I... I wanted to stick my fingers up that dribbling old judge's nose... ...and scream right down his earhole... \"Objection!\" Maya: Oh... So, did you want to become a lawyer when you were young...? Phoenix: I don't think that's quite it, Maya. I think he's just in a bad mood, that's all... Kudo: I've got a tsunami of frustration inside and it's ready to burst out! Phoenix: (If we let him start rambling now, we might never shut him up! What should I do?) Cut in Phoenix: Um, actually, we've got places to go, things to check and stuff... Maybe another time? Kudo: Fine! Whatever! Just don't forget! I've got a tsunami's worth of grumbling to do. Phoenix: Yes, yes. This girl right here is really looking forward to hearing it all. Honest! Maya: What!? I never said that! Kudo: Come to the place where I work, then. Here. Bring this along with you. Phoenix: (What is this? It's covered in seeds... A discount coupon for a burger!?) Maya: He really wants someone to grumble at, huh? ...Although, it IS a burger joint... Leads back to Talk options Suck it up Phoenix: (Guess I better let him talk...) So, there's not much call for craftsmen these days, then? Kudo: Of course not, you idiot! All I'm good for nowadays is running errands! Maya: Errands? Kudo: Everyone takes advantage of the elderly! \"Buy some bread, gramps!\" \"Take the dog for a walk, granddad!\" \"Feed the pigeons, old man!\" What am I? Some sort of two-bit community handyman!? Maya: Um, well... Kudo: \"Buy some bread\", now that I can understand. But what's the point of feeding some seedy pigeons!? Why don't people say what they mean!? \"Get lost!\" That's what they're trying to say! Oh, yes! I'm just an inconvenience, you see! At home... At that restaurant... I just get in the way, don't I!? Phoenix: I-I'm sure you don't. (Wait a minute! What did he just say? At home and... at that restaurant?) Hold up... By \"restaurant\", are you talking about Trés Bien? Did you get asked to run an errand there, too? Kudo: Yes, I did! The very day that young brat was poisoned. Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? Leads back to Talk options The \"errand\" (appears after selecting \"Suck it up\" upon selecting \"Embroiderer\" Talk option) Phoenix: So on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do? Kudo: Glad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me. Armstrong: \"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!\" Kudo: \"Call them yourself!\" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time. Maya: So, did you end up calling the police? Kudo: Like I said, I was in a bit of a daze. Phoenix: Did you call them on your cell phone? Kudo: Kah! Do I look like I'd have one of those new-fangled thingamajigs? I went out looking for a pay phone, of course! Maya: You went looking for one...? Kudo: I couldn't find one right away, you know. Wandered around for 5 minutes or so. Maya: F-Five minutes...? Phoenix: So for five minutes after the incident happened... Kudo: Yessiree, the owner was at Trés Bien on his own. Phoenix: Why didn't you mention this in court this morning? Kudo: Well, I would have if you'd given me the chance! But you all bullied me out of the courtroom! Judge: *sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today. Kudo: WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else... Judge: Bailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom! Kudo: It's not my fault! You're the ones to blame! Phoenix: You could have at least told us before we got to court. Maya: Is it really that important that Mr. Kudo was the one who called the police...? Phoenix: (What's important is the unaccounted time before the police arrived. The victim was dead, and Maggey was unconscious. Which leaves that woman... I mean, that man, alone in the restaurant!) Mr. Kudo might have been chased out of the place on purpose. Maya: What do you mean? Phoenix: Maybe a certain someone didn't want him in the restaurant. Maya: Ah! Kudo: Oh, sure! You go ahead and say I was in the way as usual! I suppose I should've been getting myself covered in pigeon poop instead, hmm? Phoenix: (We need to get more details about what exactly happened... ...from Maggey... and from Mr. Armstrong!) The \"errand\" (subsequent times) Phoenix: So on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do? Kudo: Glad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me. Armstrong: \"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!\" Kudo: \"Call them yourself!\" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time. Maya: So, did you end up calling the police? Kudo: Like I said, I was in a bit of a daze. Phoenix: Did you call them on your cell phone? Kudo: Kah! Do I look like I'd have one of those new-fangled thingamajigs? I went out looking for a pay phone, of course! Maya: You went looking for one...? Kudo: I couldn't find one right away, you know. Wandered around for 5 minutes or so. Maya: F-Five minutes...? Phoenix: So for five minutes after the incident happened... Kudo: Yessiree, the owner was at Trés Bien on his own. Present Anything Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this? Kudo: ... Kah! Phoenix: Excuse me... Kudo: You let me get a million of my grumbles off my chest, and I'll take one quick look. I've got an earthquake of frustration inside and it's ready to rumble! Phoenix: ...On second thought, forget it. A million grumbles for one quick look doesn't sound like a good deal... for me. After clearing \"The \"errand\"\" Talk option in Vitamin Square: January 7Trés BienKitchen Maya: Looks like Mr. Armstrong's out again. Phoenix: But the place is open for business... You can't have an open restaurant without a chef! Maya: Hey! It's not my fault, Nick! Don't take it out on me! Phoenix: (Only a couple of minutes after the incident happened... Mr. Kudo left the scene, leaving Mr. Armstrong here alone.) Maya: Argh... Missing when we need to talk to him the most. Phoenix: (Maybe he's trying to avoid us on purpose?) After breaking Psyche-Lock, clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien: January 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room Byrde: Oh, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Hello, Maggey. So they finished questioning you? Byrde: Wasn't it just unbelievable in court today, sir!? I'm going to stay up all night and blog about everything that happened! Maya: Weren't you scared? It was pretty touch and go in there. Byrde: Yeah, but you totally nailed that old man! Phoenix: Well, he was all over the place with his testimony. Byrde: He's not the only one! Maya: Huh? What do you mean? Byrde: Everyone else's testimonies don't match up either. Not with what I remember of the incident, anyway... Phoenix: (Is it possible she is the one misremembering things...?) Talk Contradictions Maya: Maggey... You know how you said that everyone else... ...provided testimony that didn't match up with what you remembered? Byrde: Yup. There are just so many things that don't seem to add up. The biggest contradiction is the other guy I saw at the victim's table. HE was the one who slipped something into the victim's coffee. I'm sure it was him! Phoenix: (But didn't Mr. Kudo testify earlier today... ...that it was the waitress who put some white powder into the coffee cup...?) Maya: So you really think it was this \"disappearing man\" that did it...? Byrde: Well, he's not the only thing that disappeared. The CD vanished as well. You know, the CD with the writing on it. Maya: Oh, yeah. The \"MC Screwdriver\" album, right? Phoenix: It was \"MC Bomber\", Maya. That name was scrawled on the sports paper as well. Byrde: They never did find that CD at the crime scene, sir. Phoenix: (Or the victim's medication. That's gone missing, too.) Maya: Ouch, my head... This is getting way too complicated for me! After the incident Phoenix: You said that you passed out when the victim, Glen Elg, collapsed, right? Byrde: Yes. It's so embarrassing. I mean, I used to be a cop! When I came to, the restaurant was buzzing with police. And before I knew what was going on, they arrested me, sir. Phoenix: So between the time the victim collapsed and the time the police arrived on the scene... ...you have no idea what went on at Trés Bien. Byrde: No. No idea at all. Why? Is it important, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The other witness, the old man from the park, was pretty much chased out of the picture. Byrde: \"Chased out of the picture\"? What do you mean? Maya: Old Seedy wasn't inside the restaurant because he was told to go call the police. Phoenix: Exactly. And you, Maggey, were unconscious. That means Mr. Armstrong was alone in the restaurant for a brief period of time. Byrde: No... Y-You don't think Mr. Armstrong... set me up... do you? Phoenix: When you consider the facts... ...it's hard to imagine that Mr. Armstrong isn't involved in this at all. Byrde: Grr! It's like the master biting the paw of the dog that it feeds! Are you sure about this, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Well, the old man said as much when we spoke with him earlier. Byrde: I don't know. The things that man says don't add up for some reason, sir... Phoenix: (Maggey looks like she's trying to figure something out...) Maya: We'd better find outexactly what happened to the old man on that day. Victor's testimony (appears after presenting Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile) Phoenix: Is there anything about Mr. Kudo's testimony that stood out as odd to you? Byrde: Actually... Yes. The fact that he was even testifying to begin with doesn't quite... Maya: ...? \"Doesn't quite\" what? Byrde: Well, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant. Phoenix: (Yeah, we know that already. It was Victor Kudo.) Byrde: But I can't really say it was an old man. Maya: OK, then how about calling him a really old middle-aged man! Byrde: No, age isn't the issue. The other customer was a woman. Phoenix: A woman!? Maya: Are you sure, Maggey!? Byrde: Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I think so. Maya: So? What did this woman look like? Byrde: Umm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh. Phoenix: \"Creepy\"? Maya: \"Cackling\"? Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling I've come across a woman like that recently?) Present Sports Paper Byrde: That's the paper the victim had with him, isn't it? Maya: That's what we think, madam. Byrde: I kind of remember him having a paper, actually. And I remember something about this \"MC Bomber\", too. Maya: It was written on the CD that disappeared as well, wasn't it? Byrde: I don't suppose it makes any difference if there was one CD or two, right? Magazine Clipping Byrde: Just thinking about the trial that day gives me the creeps. Maya: Was it that bad? Phoenix: D-Don't forget that was my phony, not me! Byrde: He was supposed to say, \"Surely the defendant isn't the real criminal!\" But instead he shouted out, \"Surely the defendant is the real criminal!\" ...By mistake. Maya: Oh, ouch. Phoenix: L-Like I said, that was my phony, not me! Byrde: I...! I don't want to think about it anymore... Phoenix: (Trust me, neither do I...) Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile Byrde: Ah, I feel much better after the trial this morning. I've been a bit of a courtroom proceedings addict for years now. It feels like forever since I was a witness as slippery as that old man. Maya: He's not really that bad of an old man though. Byrde: Still, I feel a bit uneasy. Maya: Huh? I thought you just said you felt much better... Phoenix: Maggey. If there's something on your mind, you've got to tell us. Especially if it has anything to do with Mr. Kudo or his testimony. Byrde: Roger! I'll spill it all and see what you make of it! Coffee Cup Byrde: That's the cup I took over to the table, sir. But! I didn't put anything in it... I just... I could never do something like that! Maya: That's right! You could never do anything like that! Byrde: I'm not good at carrying those large trays, you know. Trying to balance a tray with one hand to put something in the coffee with the other... That'd just be asking for trouble. I'd drop something, for sure! Maya: Th-That's right! Phoenix: (...I-Is she expecting me to claim that she's too clumsy to have committed the crime...?) Apron Byrde: Oh, yeah. That's from when I was carrying a customer's breakfast over to them. Phoenix: The ketchup splotch, you mean? Byrde: My whole face was fire-engine red, thanks to that stuff. Maya: But you spilled the ketchup in your apron, didn't you? I don't see how... Byrde: The ketchup-covered omelet went flying and hit the customer in the face. Maya: Oh, talk about a tomato-red face! Makes me wish I could've seen it myself. Byrde: Yeah, I guess... It was kind of a sight to behold. Potassium Cyanide Byrde: Potassium cyanide? I've never heard of that poison before in my life, sir! Phoenix: ... Byrde: OK, maybe I have. But I've never seen it before. That's the truth. I wouldn't even know where the nearest potassium cyanide dealer is in the first place. Maya: Potassium cyanide dealers? Sounds like another group of drug pushers to avoid... Phoenix: In any case, this definitely isn't something you can pick up just anywhere. Byrde: Ooh!! Curse my rotten luck! The criminal must've stuck the bottle in my apron while I was unconscious! Gumshoe's Lunchbox Phoenix: Oh, yeah! I've got something you're going to love! Byrde: Really? What is it!? Phoenix: A lunchbox, just for you. Here! Byrde: Wow! A lunchbox! Weenies, too! I can't believe it! Thank you, sir! Did you make this just for me, Mr. Wright? Maya: Nah, it was Detective Gumshoe! Who else would make such a nice lunchbox for you? Byrde: Detective Gumshoe? Maya: He's really worried about you. Looks like he put a lot of effort into making this, too! Byrde: ... I can't accept it. Detention Center rules. No gifts allowed, sir. Phoenix: Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't be like that. Byrde: The rules are the rules! They'll lock you up if you break them. Phoenix: (Somehow, when an ex-cop turned waitress says that, it seems a whole lot scarier.) Byrde: And anyway... I hate weenies! Maya: O-Oh... really? Byrde: It's all yours, Maya! You can enjoy it with Mr. Wright! Maya: B-But... Phoenix: ... She's right... It's better than letting it go to waste. Maya: But! ...I guess so. Gumshoe's Lunchbox eaten with Maya. Byrde: ... Well? How was it? Phoenix: That hit the spot! I love weenies. Byrde: Oh, good! I'm glad I gave it to you, then, sir! Paper Badge Byrde: Ah! Is that... your attorney's badge? Phoenix: Actually, it's a fake. Byrde: Hoooly smokes! That's it!! Maya: Huh? Byrde: That's the badge your phony had, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: You got duped by this...!? Maya: But it's a completely different color! Phoenix: And what about the fact that it's made of paper!? Byrde: He said the badge got a tan as well, while he was in Hawaii on business. Phoenix: (I'm beginning to see how my phony was able to gain her trust...) Glen Elg profile Byrde: Ah! That's the victim, isn't it? Phoenix: That day was the first time you'd ever seen this man, right? Byrde: Yes. I'd never met or seen him before then. I just happened to be the waitress who served him his coffee, sir. That's all! Phoenix: It seems he was a computer programmer. Byrde: Really? I'm useless with computers. Completely hopeless. I don't know any computer programs. Phoenix: (Did she mean \"programmers\"?) Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Back when I was an officer, Detective Gumshoe always looked out for me. But today! Today I was the one who had to look out for him; trying to incriminate me the whole time! Phoenix: You've got to remember, Maggey. Gumshoe's a detective. He's got a job to do. Byrde: My old boss... I thought at least he'd be on my side. Maya: He is on your side! He'd do anything to help y-- Byrde: You can't fool me! I saw him in court today! I felt like a poor little baby woodpecker being pecked on the head by its own mother! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's testimony was pretty solid... No wonder it hurt her so much.) Byrde: I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again! Phoenix: (Ouch. I think I just saw Gumshoe's chances go down in flames like the Hindenburg...) Maya: I don't think it's getting through to her that he really was trying to help... Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Mr. Armstrong was very good to me after I was fired from the force. I can't believe someone as nice as him could have anything to do with this... Phoenix: (Well, in the time between the victim being poisoned and the police being called... ...the only person who was on the scene and had a chance to do anything... ...was Mr. Armstrong. There was no one else there.) Byrde: M-Mr. Armstrong wouldn't... He wouldn't set me up... would he!? Furio Tigre profile Byrde: Hoooly smokes! That's him!! Maya: Huh? Byrde: That's your phony, Mr. Wright! Just look at that ridiculous suntan! Phoenix: Um... For the record, I'm not sunburned like an over-dried tomato so I don't know... Byrde: He told me he'd been on a business trip to Hawaii and that's where he got the tan. Phoenix: (I'm not hearing this...) Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be in the police force. But I'm incarcerated, now. I don't pick up much information in here. All I can help you out with now is the menu at Trés Bien. Maya: Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't let your spirits fall! After examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes in Tender Lender, and clearing \"Victor's testimony\" Talk option and presenting Gumshoe's Lunchbox in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Detective: The main server just went up in smoke! Why the heck isn't the press conference set up yet!? The Superintendent's here already! Chief: Yeah. And there's a problem with the Internet, too. Detective: I already told you to stop using your computer, Chief! Chief: But I'm watching videos online! I'm catching up on my Asian soap operas! Detective: It's gonna have to wait, Chief. I'm throwing the switch! Chief: Nooo! Just when Sum Yung-Gai was about to confess to his son's hot-to-trot girlfriend! Maya: Wow! This place is really buzzing. Phoenix: Something must be going down. Something really big. Gumshoe: Huh!? What are you doing here, pal? Maya: Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: You can't be here right now. You'll be roped into the briefing if you stay. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: We've got big problems here today. Maya: Why? What's going on? Gumshoe: It's a virus! A virus!! Phoenix: (A virus?) Gumshoe: There's a virus ripping through the precinct's computer system. Phoenix: (But I really need to ask you some questions...) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Your batteries won't last forever. Remember that when you're having fun... in bed.\" We have a winner! A little joke to make people think about their smoke alarms. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a fire safety campaign... ...I guess? ...Does he even know what he's trying to get across anymore? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut. Chief: Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to read the paper now. Phoenix: (Alternately, you could read some reports... Just a suggestion.) Chief: What the heck is this!? This paper's more than a month old! And someone's written all over it! Who's the clown that put this on my desk? Well? Speak up! Maya: He just wadded it up and chucked it in the trash! Phoenix: But that's an important piece of evidence! Talk Tender Lender Gumshoe: OK, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up! Maya: Y-Yes! Gumshoe: No matter how poor you get, never borrow money from a place like this, you hear? Maya: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: If you got money trouble, just go on a diet of instant noodles and hang in there! Phoenix: Ah, we're not thinking about borrowing money, Detective! We want information. Gumshoe: Oh... Is that all? Well, let's see... Tender Lender is considered to be even fishier than the average illegal loan shark. And it seems it ran into trouble just recently. Those guys have been pretty heavy-handed, calling in all their debts. Maya: Really? Gumshoe: Don't go poking your nose around in their business, pal. You'll really regret it if you upset that lady. Phoenix: Alright, I get the picture. (Hey, wait a minute! What did he just say!? \"That lady\"?) Maya: Who's this lady he's talking about, Nick? Phoenix: (We better find out what the story is with this \"lady\"...) Computer viruses Maya: So what exactly is a computer virus, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I dunno. Maya: What? Gumshoe: Look, I just go with the flow, alright, pal? Phoenix: (And here I thought detectives were supposed to be somewhat knowledgeable...) Gumshoe: What's with that face, pal? You think you know what a virus is? Maya: Well, Nick? Do you? Phoenix: A computer virus? Sure. I mean, only in simple terms, of course. Maya: Really? Wow, you know everything. Professor Nick! Gumshoe: Yeah. I'm gonna call you Dr. Wright from now on! Maya: Hey, that sounds pretty cool! Don't you agree, Dr. Wright? Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling they're making fun of me?) OK, fine. I'm no expert, but I can at least explain the basics to the two of you. What's a virus? (appears after \"Computer viruses\") Phoenix: A virus is a program that gets inside a computer and causes damage. Gumshoe: Damage? You mean it makes the machine go \"boom\" and explode? Phoenix: No. The damage is, um... Well, it's all internal. Maya: So the inside goes \"boom\", right? Phoenix: Imagine all the case data you've got stored on your PCs here in the station... A virus could wipe out all that. That's the kind of damage I'm talking about. Maya: Whoa! That's scary. Phoenix: Yeah. And what's even more scary is that viruses are infectious. Maya: Infectious? Phoenix: Most computers are connected together on a network, right? A virus can move on machine to another over the network. So the virus just keeps spreading faster and faster. Gumshoe: Hmph. Just like a real virus, huh. Maya: But, Nick! Why would anyone want to make a program like that? Gumshoe: Yeah. It takes ages to type in all that data. Why would you wanna destroy it, pal? Phoenix: No. People don't infect their own machines. They send the virus to someone else's. Maya: What!? That's horrible! Gumshoe: Oh, I get it... It's like you sneezing on Godot so he catches a cold. Maya: Right! Then he wouldn't be able to turn up in court because he'd be too sick. You really shouldn't do stuff like that, Nick. It's wrong. Phoenix: Who? What? Where? When and why did the conversation jump to talking about me!? Anyway, that's what a computer virus is. A bad program that causes damage. Gumshoe: And all the different viruses have names, right? I kinda feel like I've heard the name of the virus we caught somewhere before. Phoenix: (The name of the virus, huh? I feel like I've heard of it before, too...) MC Bomber (appears after presenting Sports Paper or MC Bomber) Gumshoe: We already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met. Maya: Who are they? Gumshoe: I dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess. Phoenix: And now the virus has been released, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival! Maya: All this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie! Gumshoe: Apparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market. Phoenix: You mean someone put this virus up for sale? Gumshoe: Yeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal. Phoenix: (In the millions!? A virus can be worth that much!?) MC Bomber updated in the Court Record. MC Bomber (subsequent times) Gumshoe: We already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met. Maya: Who are they? Gumshoe: I dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess. Phoenix: And now the virus has been released, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival! Maya: All this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie! Gumshoe: Apparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market. Phoenix: You mean someone put this virus up for sale? Gumshoe: Yeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal. Phoenix: (In the millions!? A virus can be worth that much!?) The Cadaverinis (appears after presenting Violetta profile) Phoenix: I'm not sure if I really want to get involved in this, but who are the Cadaverinis? Gumshoe: Who are they? A scary bunch of people, that's who! Phoenix: (You're a cop, and you're scared? What's that about?) Gumshoe: Trust me, it doesn't matter if you're kid or a cop, these guys are scary. They've got some serious clout in the criminal underworld. We can't touch them. They've got too much moola. Phoenix: Moola...? As in? Gumshoe: They pretty much control all the cash on the city's black market. Phoenix: The black market, huh? And that includes Tender Lender, I take it? Gumshoe: Sure. No one stands up to Bruto Cadaverini. And I mean, no one! Phoenix: (Interesting...) Maya: So Viola's the granddaughter of some mafia boss then? Gumshoe: Yeah. And everyone know how much Bruto loves his little girl. She means everything to him. Phoenix: So... How did she end up at Tender Lender? Gumshoe: I dunno, pal. But I heard she and the boss of the Tender Lender are pretty tight. Maya: Tight? Gumshoe: That's what it said in a file I read related to Maggey's case. Phoenix: (Sounds like a pretty important clue.) Present Sports Paper or MC Bomber Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, umm... about this... Gumshoe: What!? I'm trying to concentrate on Maggey and this virus right now, so I... Aaaaaaaaaaah!! This is it! This stupid name! I remember now! Phoenix: (I thought so. Here it comes...) Maya: Don't just nod to yourself and keep me in the dark, Nick! What's going on!? Phoenix: It's OK, Maya! You don't have to cry about it! Gumshoe: The name scribbled on that sports paper and written on that CD... That's the name of the virus! \"MC Bomber\"! Maya: WHAT!? Gumshoe: Yeah! The virus that's just infected every computer in the station, pal. It's MC Bomber! Phoenix: Can you give us any more details? Please? Glen Elg profile Gumshoe: This guy was a real programming genius. They called him \"the walking computer\" at the place where he worked. Maya: What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!? Phoenix: (*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!) Gumshoe: Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim. Violetta profile Gumshoe: That's the girl who works over at Tender Lender. You wanna stay away from her, OK? I mean it. Maya: She does look kind of unforgiving, doesn't she? Gumshoe: That should be the least of your worries, pal. Phoenix: (What's that supposed to mean? What could be worse...?) Gumshoe: Her name's Viola Cadaverini. She's the only granddaughter of Bruto Cadaverini. Maya: Bruto Cadaverini? Do you know who that is, Nick? Phoenix: Never heard of him. Gumshoe: Bruto Cadaverini's the boss of the Cadaverini family. Phoenix: The Cadaverinis? (That's one scary-sounding name!) Gumshoe: We can't touch them. They're way too powerful for the police. But you're thinking of taking them on, aren't you? Phoenix: N-No! I don't remember ever saying I was going to! (I better get some more info out of Gumshoe about this \"family\"...) Furio Tigre profile Gumshoe: Oh, this guy... The Tiger... Maya: Is he famous? Gumshoe: Yeah. This guy's not a loan shark, you know. Nope. He's a big loan cat! Phoenix: Hence the name? Gumshoe: Don't pay him back, and you'd better say your prayers, because he'll eat you alive. Maya: You're shaking, Detective. Phoenix: Like a leaf... Gumshoe: I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean. Bruto Cadaverini profile Gumshoe: I wouldn't go flashing that photo around if I were you, pal. Maya: Why not? Gumshoe: That guy rules the criminal underworld. You could get yourselves in serious trouble. I'm talking say-your-prayers trouble. Maya: You're shaking, Detective. Phoenix: Like a leaf... Gumshoe: I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean. After clearing \"MC Bomber\" and \"The Cadaverinis\" Talk options: Gumshoe: Aaaaargh! I can't believe it! I almost forgot the most important thing! Phoenix: A-And that is...? Gumshoe: You know, the lunchbox! How did everything go!? Phoenix: L-Lunchbox? Maya: You remember. The weenies...? Byrde: I hate weenies! Phoenix: (Oh, yeah... Those weenies.) Gumshoe: So? How did my weenies taste when they went down the hatch? Maya: Huh? Um... Well... It was... delicious! Gumshoe: Yeah? That's what she said? Really!? Maya: Umm... Well... Not exactly... Gumshoe: Don't worry about it, pal. I figured something would happen, so I came prepared. Phoenix: Prepared? What do you mean...? Gumshoe: I made a jumbo lunchbox! Maya: Oh... Gumshoe: Do me a favor again, huh, pal, and deliver this? Phoenix: (This sure is a heavy burden... In more ways than one...) Gumshoe: I can just imagine Maggey's little eyes sparkling with joy when you bring her that! Maya: ...Weenies, again, Nick? Tell me we don't have to eat all these too... Gumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya. Again. Maya: I really can't eat any more... Present Gumshoe's Lunchbox Gumshoe: Don't forget to give that to Maggey, OK? Maya: But they don't allow presents for the prisoners in the detention center, right...? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right... ... Well it doesn't matter. I'm counting on you to get it to her somehow. Phoenix: (I'm a lawyer, not a delivery boy, Gumshoe...) Blue Screens, Inc. Talk Glen's troubles (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Basil: Glen's head had more processing power than any computer. But it had been infected with a \"gambling\" virus. Glen was... in too deep. Phoenix: You mean he was in debt? Basil: Yes. 100,000 dollars in debt. Not an easy amount to repay. So... He said he was taking on some extra work. Something a bit risky. Phoenix: \"Risky\"? How? Maya: Maybe he was going to become a waitress at Trés Bien!? Phoenix: (Where do you come up with these ideas!?) Risky extra work (appears after \"Glen's troubles\") Phoenix: So it's safe to say Mr. Elg was the creator of this virus, huh? Basil: The \"MC Bomber\" virus? Yes. It was a work of genius. In a bad sort of way, of course. But still genius. Something like that would probably fetch several million dollars on the black market. Phoenix: (Inconceivable! Gumshoe was right for a change!) This date, December 3rd, that is marked on his calendar... That was his deadline for repaying his debts. MC Bomber updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: (I guess we won't be needing these horse racing tickets any more.) Glen Elg's Losing Horse Racing Tickets thrown back on the floor. Maya: Use the trash can, Nick! Risky extra work (subsequent times) Phoenix: So it's safe to say Mr. Elg was the creator of this virus, huh? Basil: The \"MC Bomber\" virus? Yes. It was a work of genius. In a bad sort of way, of course. But still genius. Something like that would probably fetch several million dollars on the black market. Phoenix: (Inconceivable! Gumshoe was right for a change!) This date, December 3rd, that is marked on his calendar... That was his deadline for repaying his debts. Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Glen's Trouble -- Phoenix: So, how about you tell me what kind of trouble Mr. Elg was in? Basil: I'm sorry, sir, but we don't deal with trouble-shooting here. Perhaps you'd like to speak to someone in customer service? Phoenix: (What's she talking about!? I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...) Ms. Basil. Let me ask you something. Did Mr. Elg's troubles have something to do with this? Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Basil: What is that? Phoenix: A lottery ticket. There were a ton of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime. (Changed from [There were hundreds of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime.] in the original release) Basil: And what is the relevance of that? Phoenix: The victim, Mr. Glen Elg... ...had a gambling habit, didn't he? Basil: I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone dreams of being rich. Even I listen to Millionaire Radio. Phoenix: (She's right. That is a bit weak on its own.) But Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to the lottery, was it? Present Losing Horse Racing Tickets Phoenix: Leads to: \"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: Everyone likes to gamble from time to time. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: But be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc. Phoenix: (Looks like I got that one wrong.) Leads back to: \"I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts.\" Present Losing Horse Racing Tickets Phoenix: Basil: What is that? Phoenix: A bunch of horse racing tickets. All losing ones. Basil: With that many tickets, you could get 1 dollar at the recycling center. You good people are very, very bad. Cashing in on others' misfortunes is immoral. Phoenix: (...Is that a whiff of hypocrisy I smell?) (Changed from [...Why did I get a whiff of hypocrisy just now?] in the original release) Basil: But what is the relevance of these tickets? Phoenix: The victim, Mr. Glen Elg... He had a gambling habit, didn't he? Basil: I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone likes to go to the races from time to time. Phoenix: (Yeah, but not everyone buys this many tickets!) Basil: Anyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own. Phoenix: You're right. But I'm not through yet. Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to horse races, was it? Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: Everyone likes to gamble from time to time. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: But be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc. Phoenix: (Looks like I got that one wrong.) Leads back to: \"Anyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!? Basil: I'm not sure. Let's ask one of the programmers... Excuse me. Can you answer this man's query, please? Programmer: The data queue that manages system tasks for trouble-shooting requires that the multi-tasking simulation for local variables be put into sleep mode so that data transmission on active nodes can be bundled correctly according to the source code. ...Obviously. Basil: So I'm afraid that is the situation, you see. Did you good people follow all that? Phoenix: Not even slightly! What was all that mumbo-jumbo? Basil: It is exactly as my programmer explained. Phoenix: (I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.) Basil: Would you like to input another question? Leads back to: \"I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...\" Phoenix: The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times. That's got to have hurt his wallet pretty bad, don't you think? Maybe bad enough to be the cause of some pretty serious trouble perhaps!? Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Basil: You are right. Glen did have a gambling habit. You good people must not follow his example, do you understand? Phoenix: Trust me. Even if I wanted to, I don't exactly have the money to buy any. Basil: But... if you win, there's no problem, is there? And Glen had a winning ticket, didn't he? For half a million dollars? Phoenix: Yeah, but... Basil: It's hard to imagine how he could have been in trouble then, isn't it? Phoenix: It's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end. But that was his first stroke of good luck. He was in deep trouble before that. Basil: Deep trouble? What do you mean? Phoenix: Mr. Elg's real problem was with someone or something more terrifying and ferocious! Present Glen's Calendar Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Elg met with someone on the day he was killed. He even made a note on this calendar about the meeting: \"Meet with The Tiger.\" Basil: What is the relevance of that? Are you trying to suggest Glen was meeting him to discuss his debt? Phoenix: Y-Yeah. That's what I was thinking. Basil: But I have never heard anything about this \"Tiger\" before. Maybe he's not even human. Maybe he really is a tiger! Phoenix: (I'm no programmer, but does she really expect me to buy such messed up logic?) In that case, I think it's time to introduce you to The Tiger. Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\".\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!? Basil: I'm not sure. Let's ask one of the programmers... Excuse me. Can you answer this man's query, please?

Phoenix: (I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.) Basil: Glen had a lot of friends, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"But I have never heard anything about this \"Tiger\" before.\" Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Phoenix: Furio Tigre... The boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\". Basil: \"Tender Lender\"!? People with businesses should think harder before naming their offices. Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk!) Well? What do you think? Basil: Our firm is doing very well at the moment. I don't think we need to borrow money. Phoenix: No, no, no! I mean about Mr. Elg! Basil: You think Glen had something to do with this Furio Tigre? Phoenix: Yes... Basil: I'm sorry. I don't know of any connection between the two of them. Phoenix: (Really? Because I've got proof that Mr. Elg and The Tiger knew each other.) Present Glen's Calendar Phoenix: Leads to: \"Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\".\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!?

Leads back to: \"You think Glen had something to do with this Furio Tigre?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: All good people get into trouble sometimes. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: Let's ask one of my programmers what they think... Excuse me? What do you think? Programmer: I'm taking a break. Basil: Yes. Perhaps I should take a break, too. Phoenix: (I wish I could take a break from my troubles, but the rest stop was about a mile back.) Leads back to: \"It's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end.\" Phoenix: Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\". This is who Mr. Elg met with on the day of his murder. And the only thing a loan shark would talk with him about would be his debt! Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Basil: It's true that Glen had racked up quite a bit of debt from his gambling habit. About 100,000 dollars, I think. Phoenix: (100,000 dollars? Ouch!) Basil: But I heard he won the lottery, so he should have been in the clear. Phoenix: (Shame Maggey couldn't get a bit of that good luck.) OK... ...So the guy got lucky and won the lottery. But what if he hadn't won? What was his plan then? Basil: Well... This isn't easy to say, but... He said he would use his talents to repay the money. Phoenix: His \"talents\"? Basil: I suspect he was talking about programming. Phoenix: Wh-What computer program is worth 100,000 dollars!? Basil: ... Perhaps you good people should leave so I can get back to my work. Phoenix: (I'm so close to cracking her!) The program in question... Was it by any chance... this!? Present MC Bomber (after clearing \"MC Bomber\" Talk option in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Well? This is it, isn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: This is a very delicate matter. Without the necessary data, there's really no way I can access the information. Phoenix: (I know Mr. Elg created some sort of program! She can't deny it if I show her the program itself as evidence!) Leads back to: \"I'm so close to cracking her!\" Phoenix: Well? This is it, isn't it? This is the virus that's infecting computers world-wide as we speak... \"MC Bomber\"! Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Tender Lender Talk The head bandage (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Viola: Four months ago... I was in a traffic accident... That's why I needed the operation... When I woke up... they told me it was nothing serious... A simple procedure... Maya: Oh! Really? Phoenix: (Well, I guess if she recovered in 4 months, it couldn't have been too big...) Viola: They said the operation... cost one million dollars... Maya: A... A... A million bucks!? Viola: My grandfather ordered Don Tigre to pay... One million dollars... In \"compensation\"... Maya: \"Compensation\", huh...? Phoenix: It's underworld lingo for paying money to settle a score. Basically, pay or get into some serious trouble! (But a million bucks!? This has to be related to our poisoning case somehow...) Compensation (appears after \"The head bandage\") Leads to: \"I wanted to believe him... I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said...\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Head Bandage -- Phoenix: You said that bandage around your head was from an operation? Viola: ... Phoenix: You also said you suffered a \"fatal injury\" to the head, correct? Viola: Yes... The operation was very... difficult, apparently... Phoenix: Now, by \"fatal injury\", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right? Viola: ... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: Did the injury in question have something to do with this? Present Repair Bill Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have here a car repair bill.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Viola: Donuts...? Phoenix: Huh? Viola: I baked them myself... Home-made donuts... Have one... Phoenix: Umm, what's inside? Viola: Jam, and... ... Phoenix: I'm sorry, but I didn't quite catch that... Viola: Hee... Hee... Phoenix: Um... Thanks, but no thanks... I think I'll pass. (I guess that was a flop. What happened to this woman for her to have such a huge bandage around her head? There must be some piece of evidence that'll prompt her to tell me what happened...) Leads back to: \"Now, by \"fatal injury\", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right?\" Phoenix: I have here a car repair bill. From this, it seems pretty obvious that this car was involved in an accident. Viola: Let me see that... ... This bill is made out to the \"Cadaverinis\"...? Phoenix: Y-Yes, it is. Viola: I don't think... I ever introduced myself... Tell me... what do the \"Cadaverinis\"... have to do with me...? Phoenix: (Something tells me she's not about to say hi and introduce herself... Alright, then...) Your relationship with the Cadaverinis is very strong... And this is why.

Phoenix: (Yeah, I can imagine...) So what happened to the person on the bike? I'm guessing they didn't get away with injuring THE Viola Cadaverini, right?

And you'll notice that the front wheel guard is badly damaged. Viola: ... Phoenix: Ms. Cadaverini... You know the truth, don't you? Viola: ... Hee... Hee... Hee... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: This repair bill was paid by Furio Tigre. The Cadaverinis have known for ages who caused the accident, haven't they? Viola: ... It's possible... Perhaps... Somewhere inside me... I know that may be true... Phoenix: (I knew it...) Viola: But... Don Tigre still saved my life... The operation was very complicated... It was very, very expensive... Phoenix: How much are we talking? Viola: ... Very, very, very expensive... Phoenix: (She seems kind of hesitant about giving me an actual figure. I should back off...) Well, anyway, it was The Tiger who paid for it, right? Viola: After I recovered... Don Tigre told me... He said he paid for the operation because... he cared about me... I... believe him...

Only a whole lot more real... And a whole lot scarier, too.) Viola: I wanted to believe him... I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said... He said it had nothing to do with my grandfather being Bruto Cadaverini... I wanted to believe he helped me because he cared about me. Not about my grandfather... But I knew... That wasn't really true... Maya: Wow. I'm so sorry. Viola: What he did to get the money was... It was... evil! Phoenix: ...! Viola: He said it was all for me... So I... I helped him... Maya: You helped him? In what way? Viola: Here... Take these... Phoenix: (What are these? Medical papers?) Viola: I'm Bruto Cadaverini's granddaughter... He had to pay compensation... He was made an offer... He simply... couldn't... refuse. Viola's Medical Papers added to the Court Record. Maya: Wow, I feel so bad for Viola. Phoenix: It's inexcusable! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: (There are two things that I consider inexcusable. Poisoning, and betrayal! Only a coward would hurt people using either of these tactics.) Maya: Is everything alright, Nick? Phoenix: We should get going. Right after we finish our espresso. Maya: Yeah. Phoenix: (I wouldn't need to convince Viola of anything else, so I guess I can get rid of this.) Repair Bill thrown into the trash. After clearing \"Risky extra work\" Talk option in Blue Screens, Inc. and clearing \"Compensation\" Talk option in Tender Lender: January 7Trés Bien Armstrong: Eh, bonjour! I 'ave been waiting for you to return. Maya: Mr. Armstrong... Phoenix: Ah, good timing. I was hoping to find you here. We'd like to ask you a few questions... ???: Well, he hasn't got anythin' to say to youse fellas! Maya: Ah! It's Xin Eohp... Tigre: Who you callin' \"Zinnee Ooooope\"!? Maya: Aaaaah! Phoenix: (Come out from under the table already, Maya!) Tigre: OK. Hand it over! Phoenix: Wh-What? Tigre: Youse wanna play games wid me? I don't recommend dat! The medical papers! Now! Phoenix: (Uh, oh... I think he wants Viola Cadaverini's papers back...) Y-You mean... this? The million dollar medical papers? Tigre: ... Phoenix: Ms. Cadaverini trusted you. That's why she said that she helped you. Tigre: Forget about it! That girl's dumber dan an eggplant. Youse wanna know what's sad? I'll tell youse what's sad. And it ain't only her face. She thinks she's got power cuz she's Bruto's little girl... Now THAT's sad... Phoenix: I can't let you have these papers. Tomorrow in court... ...I'm going to expose what you did to get the one million you used to pay this off! Tigre: ... Are you crazy or somethin'!? I don't care if you wanna give it to me or not! There's two of us here. You got dat? Two. Armstrong: Err... oui! Oui, oui! Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong!? Armstrong: Forgive me! Désolé! I cannot argue wiz 'im! Phoenix: U-Urgh! (...That... really hurt!) Tigre: Is dat all youse got? I'll be takin' dose papers now. Armstrong! Get that lighter! Phoenix: W-Wait...! Tigre: Don't take it too hard... ...Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (That was so stupid... I shouldn't... have let my guard down. Those medical papers were... vital... evi...dence...) Hold it, pal! Phoenix: D-Detective Gumshoe!? Tigre: D-Detective!? Youse think you gonna stop me, copper!? Beat it! Gwaaaaaaaaaaar! Gumshoe: Whoa! C-Come on, Gumshoe! Keep it together! You guys! Get outta here! Leave this guy to me. Phoenix: B-But... Gumshoe: Go, pal! And take this! If you get hurt, who'd look after Maggey, huh!? Phoenix: ...! A-Alright! Thanks, Gumshoe! Maya: Wait, Nick! Don't leave me behind! Phoenix: (I'll get even with that guy tomorrow... in court! Tender Lender is going down!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- At Trés Bien --Armstrong: When it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And who were the two customers, exactly? Armstrong: Mais, of course. La young man who died... ...and la other, not-so-young, man. Judge: Hmm... You are referring to yesterday's witness, I presume? Phoenix: (What about the other man Maggey says she saw at the table? Something tells me Mr. Armstrong isn't planning to disclose his existence...) Maya: We need some hard evidence first before we can bring him up, don't we...? Phoenix: I guess I'll just have to try a different approach for the time being.Armstrong: I remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You were experimenting with art deco? How come I never heard about that before today? Armstrong: You are not familiar w'iz z'e language of interior design, monsieur? Phoenix: Please stay on topic! Now, why didn't you tell the court about this before!? Armstrong: But I did. Just a few moments ago! Judge: Ahem! Excuse me, Mr. Armstrong. This \"deco\" you mentioned... Are you referring to some sort of \"decocture\"? Phoenix: No, no! Art deco, it is a style of design! ...Your Honor. He's talking about interior design. Walls, ceilings, carpets, that kind of thing. Judge: Ah, yes. Of course. That \"deco\". Armstrong: I was trying to achieve a more \"la effeminate\" look for my restaurant. I was planning z'e most bold remodeling of la decor.Armstrong: Like 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How big of a mirror are we talking about here? Armstrong: Bof! Something about 4 meters wide and, err... Oui. About 2 meters 'igh. Phoenix: (Let's see... If 1 meter is about 1 yard... Holy glass in a frame, that's huge!) Armstrong: I was intending to install it on la ceiling eventually. Phoenix: The ceiling!? (Was there a mirror on the ceiling!? I don't remember...) Armstrong: Mais, non. But I decided not to go through w'iz it in z'e end. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I ask him more about the mirror or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (He couldn't lie about such a huge object like that. It must've been there in the restaurant somewhere.) Godot: ... Leads to: \"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\" Press harder Phoenix: If you really had such a large mirror in the restaurant, someone would have noticed it! But there's nothing about a mirror in Mr. Kudo or Maggey Byrde's testimonies! Armstrong: B-But... Godot: Godot: You didn't ask, Trite. You have only yourself to blame for such sloppy work. Phoenix: What!? Godot: A mirror was delivered to Trés Bien the day before the incident. Phoenix: R-Really? Godot: As Mr. Armstrong testified, he was carrying out some design changes. And as it turned out, he didn't actually use the mirror in the end. Phoenix: (This just doesn't add up. Even if a mirror was delivered to Trés Bien... ...it doesn't prove that it was in the restaurant on the day of the crime.) Godot: Ha...! If you want to doubt someone, Trite, look in the mirror. I'm sure the person looking back at you will be dubious enough! Leads to: \"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\" Judge: Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...Armstrong: Oui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Normally, I'd expect people to know the difference between a reflection and a real object. Godot: Godot: \"Normally\"? How does normality come into this? That's lame, Trite. Even for you. Phoenix: Huh? Godot: Are you trying to say that if something isn't normal, it isn't possible? Is that it? Where does that leave the porcu-headed lawyer and the topknot chick over there... and the ungodly cool guy with the mask over here? Well, Trite!? Phoenix: Aaack! Not the hair! Maya: I do not have a topknot! Judge: Mr. Godot is correct. A lack of normality is no basis for discounting an argument. Armstrong: Bien! Logic 'as won la day!Armstrong: La cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Everything? He would have seen everything in reverse? Armstrong: Oui. Maya: Hey, Nick... We should take a sec and think about what Old Seedy said in his testimony... Phoenix: (How did he phrase it again...?) Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs. Kudo: No question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt! Kudo: And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand! Maya: If he saw everything he described reflected in a mirror... ...then everything he said he saw on the \"left\" was actually on the \"right\", huh. Phoenix: (And that clears up all the problems with his testimony, I guess... Or does it...?) Godot: Ha...!Present Glen Elg profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD...\"Phoenix: (It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a mirror, but...)Maya: Do you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?Phoenix: If he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.Maya: But that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!Phoenix: The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD... Let's think back over Mr. Kudo's testimony for a second, shall we?Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.Kudo: No question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!Phoenix: So, to summarize... ...we were told both the HMD and the earpiece were on the victim's left side. Now, if Mr. Kudo saw all that as a reflection in a mirror... ...it means both the HMD and the earpiece were actually on the victim's right side.Armstrong: Exactement! You see, monsieur. Now z'at you think about it, it is not so 'ard, non?Phoenix: Unfortunately, that's where we run into a monumental contradiction with the facts! If Mr. Kudo really did see everything in a mirror... ...why is it that the HMD is now on the wrong side of his head!?Judge: Order! Order! ...Mr. Wright is correct! If the witness genuinely observed the victim reflected in a mirror... ...then we would expect the victim's eyepiece to have been over his right eye.Godot:Godot: ...How bitter. Trite, you should have a taste of this bitterness. It'll calm you down in no time.Phoenix: A-Are we talking about your coffee... or something completely different...?Godot: You don't understand the way the witness thinks.Judge: How he thinks?Godot: You remember this, I presume?Phoenix: The \"I broke the vase... sorry\" apology lett-- I mean Mr. Kudo's sworn testimony?Godot: Exactly. The old man has one very grievous habit... other than throwing seeds. The more of an impression something makes, the more muddled his mind makes it. And what's the most striking thing about Mr. Elg?Judge: Clearly, it's the victim's eyepiece.Godot: And that's my point. The old man strikes again! Mr. Elg's HMD made a big impression on the old man. \"I saw the earpiece and those new-fangled spectacles he was wearing! Oh, yes! They were both on his left ear! Do you hear? His left ear!\" Ha...! Well, Trite?Phoenix: Urk... (That's the worst, but best impression of Kudo ever...)Maya: Wow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!Judge: Enough! I must agree that yesterday's witness was irresponsibly rash in much of his testimony.Maya: Bad luck, Nick. Looks like the \"boil\" of a contradiction you found is just a \"rash\".Godot: A mirror can't be beaten by a handful of seeds, nor can it lie. So... What exactly was the old man looking at? Fill us in, Mr. Armstrong. Go on, tell the court. We're all ears.Armstrong: Oui. I can explain. Please, if you will look at la plans of la restaurant.Witness Testimony-- The Mirror --Armstrong: Alors. Is everyone sitting comfortably? La mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves. Z'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim. Z'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting. After la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way. But naturally, I did not touch anything else!Judge: Hmm... I see no problems with the explanation we have just heard. From the table next to the victim's, Mr. Kudo could have seen the victim in the mirror.Armstrong: What a naughty little coquette I am, confusing all z'e men like z'is!Godot: Don't worry about it. We can keep up, except for the guy breaking out in a cold sweat over there again.Phoenix: (Argh! I hate that guy!)Judge: You said you didn't touch anything else apart from the mirror. Are you quite sure about that?Armstrong: Volontiers! Of course!Judge: Very well. Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you please.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Mirror --Armstrong: La mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, run this by me again. The mirror was here, correct? Armstrong: Oui. Phoenix: Oui? Really!? Because I know if I were you, I wouldn't have put a mirror there! It would be in the way! Godot: Godot: Look who's talking, Trite. Phoenix: Huh? Godot: You're obstructing my view, among other things. Phoenix: But, but, but! This is my seat in the courtroom...! Godot: Trés Bien's \"charm\" is that it gives you the impression that you're the only customer. Temporarily placing a mirror in that spot would hardly be \"in the way\". Unlike you... Trite. Armstrong: I tell you, monsieur. la mirror was z'ere, in z'e middle of la restaurant.Armstrong: Z'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And where would that be!? Armstrong: Oh lá lá! Look 'ow you lean towards me! I always attract z'e younger boys! Maybe I should keep you in suspense a little longer! Judge: Mr. Armstrong! Tell the court what you know at once! Armstrong: I attract z'e older ones, too, you know, 'andsome! Shall I tease you, too!? Judge: Nnngh... Godot: I'm already seeing a very hot someone, so I'm afraid you'll be waiting for a long time. Maya: I bet she has mocha-cream skin and cappuccino perfume. Armstrong: Bien. I will tell you... Z'ere was only one seat from which you could 'ave seen...Armstrong: Z'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So why can you only see the victim from that particular seat? Armstrong: Mais, monsieur. It is obvious, non? If you look at la plans you will understand. La victim would 'ave been reflected in la mirror like so. If you were sitting at la table next to 'im, you would see everything, non? Maya: So that's the seat Old Seedy was sitting in on that day... ...when the poisoning happened. Phoenix: (The old man was sitting at the table next to the victim? Why does that seem kinda odd...?)Present Victor's Testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! Mr. Kudo's words yesterday strongly contradict Mr. Armstrong's testimony! Judge: This is... the letter of apology that was written by Mr. Kudo, is it not? Phoenix: I realize it looks useless, Your Honor, but this is still testimony. Godot: Ha...! I guess useless people are only really good at identifying useless things. Judge: What relevance does this scrap of paper have to the trial, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Mr. Kudo's testimony is actually very relevant to the question at hand, Your Honor! Because it very clearly contradicts with this piece of evidence! Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Phoenix: This piece of evidence contradicts with testimony we have heard, Your Honor! Judge: The crime photo...? Phoenix: Yes. This photo clearly shows something that theoretically should not exist! Judge: What on Earth do you mean by that, Mr. Wright!? Godot: \"Should not exist\"? Ha... Sounds like you're describing yourself, Trite. Judge: Now then, if the defense would please clarify its statement. What is the something that \"should not exist\" in this photo? Present vase on left table Phoenix: Leads to: \"There is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony.\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is what should not be in the picture! Judge: I'm sorry? I'm afraid you've lost me. Phoenix: Um... Godot: Ha...! I suppose it's up to me to clarify the defense's claim. The something that \"shouldn't exist\" is clearly... Phoenix: Phoenix: W-Wait, wait, wait! I've change my mind, Your Honor! (The last thing I need right now is a scalding hot coffee shower...) Judge: Very well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court. Armstrong: Oui. I would be delighted! Leads back to cross-examination Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Your Honor? Judge: Well... ...I'm not sure the contradiction... ...is as clear as you would have us believe, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: ...Oh. Judge: Perhaps you should reconsider before you try again, hm? Phoenix: Try again...? (You mean I was wrong?) Judge: Very well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court. Armstrong: Oui. I would be delighted! Leads back to cross-examinationPresent Crime Photo Phoenix: Phoenix: This piece of evidence contradicts with testimony we have heard, Your Honor! Judge: The crime photo...?

Present vase on left table Phoenix: Phoenix: I think it's pretty obvious that this is what should not be in the picture! Judge: The vase!? What possible connection does that have with this witness's testimony? Phoenix: Your Honor... I'm telling you that there should have been no vase on this table. Because it very clearly contradicts with this piece of evidence!

Armstrong: Oui. I would be delighted! Leads back to cross-examinationArmstrong: After la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you move the mirror while Mr. Kudo was off calling the police? Armstrong: Oui. Exactement. I carried it out of la restaurant z'en. Phoenix: You moved a huge mirror like that all by yourself? Armstrong: What can I say? I know 'ow to pick things up, 'andsome! Phoenix: ... Godot: Heh heh... Maya: G-Godot actually laughed at something! Judge: Well, given the witness's physique, I suppose it is possible. Did you move anything else from the crime scene, Mr. Armstrong? Armstrong: I look like z'e obliging type, non?Armstrong: But naturally, I did not touch anything else!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure about that? Armstrong: I touched nothing except la mirror! Phoenix: ... Judge: Mr. Wright? Is there something the witness has said that doesn't match the crime scene? Phoenix: (Yeah, there is... I just can't put my finger on what exactly.) Godot: Ha...! Suffering from a case of heartburn, Trite? Armstrong: Oh, I 'ave just z'e thing for z'at! An oil with golden myrrh and frankenstaince... Godot: Add a few drops to your coffee, and voila! Enjoy. Phoenix: (Focus, Phoenix. Breathe... I need to ignore those two and just find some evidence.)Present Victor's Testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor!

You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.Phoenix: Then the only logical explanation is... ...that there was no mirror inside Trés Bien that day.

The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows two dining tables separated by a folding screen, each with an intact vase on them. Testimony 4 (Armstrong) states that after the incident he moved the mirror so it was not in the way, implying the mirror could have been somewhere in the restaurant affecting the witness's perception. If the mirror was moved after the incident, it means the crime photo does not reflect the exact setup at the time of the incident, which can cause contradictions with testimonies relying on visual observations through the mirror.\n\nHowever, looking more closely:\n\nTestimony 1 and 2 (Armstrong) claim there was only one seat from which the victim could be seen reflected in the mirror, and that seat was the table next to the victim, where \"the old man\" was sitting (Victor Kudo). This suggests that Kudo's view of the victim was via the mirror.\n\nEvidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows the scene from near the kitchen. The photo clearly shows the vase intact on the table next to the victim, which should be the old man's table according to Armstrong's testimony. But in Kudo's statement (not listed here as testimony but in the text), there is a claim about the vase being broken on the victim's table, which contradicts the photo.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between:\n\n- Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) showing an intact vase on the victim's table;\n\n- Testimony by Kudo (referenced in the text) that the victim knocked over the vase on the table (the victim's table).\n\nBut as the prompt only includes testimonies by Armstrong (Testimonies 0 to 4) and the evidence, the only testimony in the set that conflicts with the existence of the vase in the crime photo is Testimony 4 (Armstrong): \"But naturally, I did not touch anything else!\"\n\nArmstrong claims he did not move anything else except the mirror after the incident, but the crime photo shows the vase as intact, and Kudo testimony (not in the testimony list but in background info) refers to a broken vase.\n\nThus, the contradiction is that Armstrong claims he did not touch anything else (Testimony 4), but the photo (Evidence 12) shows the victim's table intact, contradicting Kudo's statement about the vase being broken and the timing Armstrong moved the mirror. Since Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident to where the photo was taken, if he did not move the vase as well, it would have been broken as per Kudo's testimony.\n\nTherefore, the pair of evidence and testimony that most directly contradict each other (from provided testimonies) is:\n\nEvidence 12 (Crime Photo)\n\nTestimony 4 (Armstrong): \"But naturally, I did not touch anything else!\"\n",

This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. I-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me! Judge: The evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee. No! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me? Payne: Well... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!? Judge: This court finds the defendant... Guilty Judge: The court is adjourned. January 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Ahh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world! Phoenix: I bet it does, Maya. Maya: So! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think? Phoenix: Sure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake. Maya: Never! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game. ???: HEY, PAL! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... Maya: Happy New Year, Detective! Gumshoe: Uh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA... Maya: Here's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation! Gumshoe: Um... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO... Maya: Have you got a holiday present for me, Detective? Gumshoe: A what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but... Maya: Yay! Thanks! Gumshoe: LOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT! Maya: Hey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you? Gumshoe: Ah... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose? Maya: Ha ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year? Gumshoe: Very funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this! Phoenix: What is it? A magazine? Maya: Hey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\" Phoenix: Tr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!? Gumshoe: It's a report, pal. About you! Maya: Listen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\" Gumshoe: WELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it! Phoenix: But I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway? Gumshoe: Umm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month. Maya: Which makes it old news, you mean. Phoenix: But I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December! Maya: Hmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick? Gumshoe: If it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility... Maya: No way. You don't mean... Phoenix: A pho... Maya: A phony Nick!? Phoenix: (This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...) Magazine Clipping added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: SO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!? Phoenix: What do you mean, what am I going to do about it? Maya: Well, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case! Phoenix: My fault!? How do you figure that? Maya: Because THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of... Gumshoe: Yeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves? Phoenix: (But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...) Gumshoe: You better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it? Maya: Sounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto! Phoenix: I don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned. Maya: ... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year. Gumshoe: So you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!? Phoenix: (I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least pretend to read them once in a while. Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's sort of a keepsake... something to remember Mia by. Sure, the office is a mess, but I never forget to water this little fella. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so it's still super neat and tidy from when Pearls cleaned it. Movie poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I have to check it out one of these days. Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they bought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called \"Gatewater Land\". ...I wonder if that bellboy is going to send me a greeting card this year, too? Talk What to do Maya: So, what's our first move? Phoenix: I guess we go down to the detention center and talk-- Maya: Wait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right? Phoenix: Hey, hey! Let's get one thing straight. It wasn't me, it was a fake me that did this! Maya: Hmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean. Phoenix: (I hope not. *shudder* ...And what kind of name for an evil double is Xin Eohp anyway!?) Maya: Ah! Nick! I've got it! Phoenix: If you're going to ask whether I've got a twin brother, the answer is no. Maya: ...Spoilsport. Any ideas Maya: Did you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me? Phoenix: What do you mean? Maya: I mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess he was acting kind of strange. Maya: Maybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick! Phoenix: ... Considering how we interact, I seriously doubt that, Maya... Maya: Well, if he wasn't nervous because of you... Phoenix: ...then maybe it's because of our new guilty client? Present Attorney's Badge Maya: So you've still got that badge, I see. Phoenix: Huh!? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I? Maya: Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job. Phoenix: (...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.) Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe you've got an impersonator. Phoenix: I can't either. *sigh* Maya: Aww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people impersonating them! Phoenix: This isn't funny, Maya. It's not just an impersonation. This guy stole my identity! And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result. Maya: ...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick? Phoenix: (...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day. Phoenix: ...That's called \"taking a shower\". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it's because Maya's at a loss these days...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia helped me out in court again last time. Maya: It's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that. Phoenix: Yeah... Maya: We mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis... Phoenix: ...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don't we just have Pearls call her? Maya: No... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her. Phoenix: (I guess Maya's got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.) Godot profile Maya: So you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh? Phoenix: I already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much. Maya: Well he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter. Phoenix: You're just making that up, Maya! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: Digging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it? Phoenix: No. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him. Maya: Yeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears! Phoenix: (Did you mean he \"gets paid dirt\" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?) Any other evidence Phoenix: Do you know anything about this, Maya? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) Any other profile Phoenix: Do you know anything about this person? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everyone, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this individual. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: It's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick? Phoenix: Looks like Gumshoe isn't around. Maya: He's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work! Phoenix: No, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case. Maya: Guess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh? Phoenix: After being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Don't die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!\" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that's the key. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Desks Phoenix: These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks. Poster Phoenix: A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT! Mask☆DeMasque turned up at the bank? What's he doing!? \"Hands up, you scalawags!\" \"You're under arrest!\" Hey! That's our job! Phoenix: (Looks like Ron DeLite's opted for a new career.) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\", right Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Umm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: This is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...? Phoenix: K-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me! ???: Aaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying. Phoenix: A-Aren't... you... ???: Yes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down! Maya: Aah! You're... Are you...? ??? Don't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Maggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt-- Byrde: Oh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!? Maya: You better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick. Byrde: O-Oh... I see... Phoenix: So that's where we stand right now. Maya: I'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder... Byrde: My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures. Phoenix: (I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...) Byrde: But I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir! Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. I bet they don't get too many waitresses in here. He looks like he's getting a bit restless. Talk Maggey Byrde Maya: So, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform. Byrde: Hmph. I was fired after that... incident last year. Maya: Oh. I'm sorry. Byrde: It's OK. I don't mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on. Maya: So, what do you do now? Byrde: In the second act of \"The Life of Maggey Byrde\", I'm playing the role of a waitress! Maya: A waitress!? Byrde: Yes. In a French restaurant. It's a small place, but it's quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir. Phoenix: And then you got into this mess straight away, right? Byrde: Yeah, you could put it that way... What happened Byrde: This whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Trés Bien. Maya: \"Treh Bee-an\"...? Byrde: Yes. It's a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included! Maya: Oh... Byrde: There were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim's cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out. Maya: Hey, hold on there, Maggey. Byrde: What? Maya: You keep calling the guy, \"the victim\". Didn't you know the guy who was killed? Byrde: Not at all! I'd never even seen the guy before! Maya: Oh... Phoenix: (So she wouldn't have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right? Byrde: Of course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele. Phoenix: So, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come? Byrde: ......... You tell me, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ack! (Guess the answer to my question is \"my phony\"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.) Guilty verdict (appears after \"What happened\") Maya: So, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted? Byrde: Because no one else saw. Maya: Saw what? Byrde: The other man. The one who put the poison in the victim's coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. \"The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time.\" Phoenix: But how's that possible? Byrde: I don't know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could've done a better job! Phoenix: Look! That wasn't me, OK? Byrde: And then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket. Maya: What? Byrde: A small bottle... of poison. Maya: WHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!? Byrde: Well, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must've slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious. Phoenix: And no one else saw this other guy? Byrde: No, sir. That's what everyone said. But I don't see how they could've missed him... The other guy (appears after \"Guilty verdict\") Byrde: I was the one who took the coffee to the two men. Phoenix: O-Oh...? And what was your impression of them? Byrde: Well... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry. Maya: In music? How come? Byrde: Well, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician's look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Maya: An earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all? Byrde: It had a band's name written on it. I think it was \"MC\"-something. They must've been preparing for their debut, I guess. Phoenix: So it was a band's CD. Maybe a promo disc? Maya: Maybe it was \"MC Screwdriver\"! Phoenix: Get serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that? Byrde: Nngh... What was the name of that group again...? \"MC Hacksaw...\"? No... \"MC...\" Maya: And what about the killer? What did he look like? Byrde: Well, I, um... I don't really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really. Present Attorney's Badge Byrde: That badge! Is it real? Phoenix: Of course it's real! Byrde: That's what they all say. But I've been duped before. Give it to me for a sec! Phoenix: Ah...! ...*chomp!* Maya: She... She bit into it... Byrde: And I left a few teeth marks, too! Phoenix: I can see that... Byrde: I just wish I could remember if that means it's real or a fake. Phoenix: *sigh* (I said it was real!) Magazine Clipping Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I need to ask you about this... Byrde: Hey! This article's about my case! Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me? Byrde: Yes, sir! It was the morning after I'd been arrested... I met you in the visitor's room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits. Phoenix: Me? Byrde: Yes, you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Argh... Maya: Hey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too? Byrde: No. I don't remember a phony you, Maya. Maya: Oh... *sigh* It would've been so cool... Byrde: Then you got really worked up and passionate. \"I'm gonna get you' cleared'a dis crime!\" you said. (Changed from ['I'm gonna get you cleared of this crime!' you said.] in the original release) Phoenix: OK, I get the picture. But you've met me in person before... So how come you didn't realize that guy wasn't the real me? Byrde: ... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange... Phoenix: Only a little? Byrde: Well, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And... Phoenix: So the guy was nothing like me, then!? Byrde: But he had your spiky hair and blue suit. Phoenix: (... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?) Maya: How about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter? Byrde: Everyone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir. Maya: This case just keeps getting weirder and weirder... Maya Fey profile Byrde: Thanks for your help last year! Maya: Aw, it was nothing. I'm glad we got you off the hook. Byrde: I hope you can help me out this year, too! Maya: Yeah, me too. It's be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned. Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Oh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force! Phoenix: Have you seen him recently? Byrde: No. He's never been to the restaurant. Maya: Guess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all. Byrde: Yeah, he prefers the simple things in life. Phoenix: (...Or he's just simply too poor to afford anything else.) Maggey Byrde profile Byrde: No matter what happens, I never let anything get me down! Maya: You're always so positive, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! The early Byrde catches the worm! A Byrde in the hand! Maya: Wow! All those phrases are named after you? Byrde: And I never turn my back on anything! Maya: You're always so strong, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! I'm a tough old Byrde! Maya: \"Tough old byrde\", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it? Phoenix: ...Yeah, I get it. Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be on the police force, sir. But I'm incarcerated, now. So I can't use my connections to help you. All I can tell you about now is info about ex-cons or the clientele of Trés Bien, sir... Maya: Aww, don't let it get you down, Maggey! After clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping: Byrde: Mr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial? Phoenix: Probably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial. Byrde: Um... Mr. Wright...? Phoenix: ? Byrde: Do you think we'll win next time? ...Sir? Phoenix: ...! Byrde: My life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck! Maya: Argh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this! Phoenix: Wh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!) Maya: We'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you! Byrde: Thank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then! Phoenix: Trés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place. Byrde: Yes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi! Maya: Sure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food! January 6Trés Bien Maya: Wow! Look at this place. Phoenix: \"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right? Maya: Actually, I'm not all that into it... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here. Phoenix: Don't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here! Maya: Perfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want! Phoenix: (Yeah, I suppose we can...) Examine Cash register Maya: Look, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money. Phoenix: You know, you're the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way! Trinkets Maya: Look at all the little trinkets tucked away in here. Phoenix: I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let's see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups! Maya: ... I never knew you were so... cultured. Phoenix: Come on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much! Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? It'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then. Phoenix: Hm? There's something stuffed in behind the rack. Maya: ...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. \"MC Bomber\", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe? Phoenix: I wonder what \"MC Bomber\" is supposed to be...? ! (This paper! It's from December 3rd...) This paper's from the day of the poisoning! Maya: WHAT!? Sports Paper added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...) Magazine rack (subsequent times) Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Looks like Mr. Armstrong doesn't get any newspapers. Maya: Well, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it? Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" like in these mags, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Phoenix: (We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I'd better try to find out everything I can about it...) Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: What do you think this flower is, Nick? Phoenix: Let's see... Well, it doesn't look like a tulip, and it's not a sunflower, I don't think... Maya: Duh. Even I could've told you that. Phoenix: Well, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I'm a lawyer, not a botanist! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got you! I was only kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Crime scene Phoenix: This must be the table where the murder occurred. Maya: I guess so, with all this police tape all around it. Phoenix: And that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don't go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya? Maya: Why would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know! Phoenix: (Then why can I picture you doing just that?) Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Sports Paper Maya: Hmm... \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: There's something about that name, \"MC Bomber\". Phoenix: Yeah, It's a pretty unusual name. Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: Everyone's worried about bombs these days, I guess. Phoenix: I'm not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...) Maya: Anyway, we should really look into this some more! Maggey Byrde profile Maya: This is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then. Maya: Wasn't she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We're gonna get her off the hook or I'll give up hamburgers! Detention Center Present Sports Paper Byrde: Oh! A sports paper. Let's see, let's see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title? Phoenix: Sorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It's from the day of the murder... Maya: And Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid. Byrde: Oh, no... Phoenix: I found this paper in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Byrde: Really? That's strange... Trés Bien doesn't get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he's not really fond of them. Maya: Then maybe one of the customers left it behind? Phoenix: Anyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here. Byrde: Ah-ha! That's it, sir! \"MC Bomber\"! That was the name that was written on the CD! Phoenix: (Just as I thought...) Maya: I guess it wasn't \"MC Screwdriver\" after all, huh... Byrde: So, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right? Maya: If someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! \"The Master of Kurain\" or \"The Spirit Song\" or even \"Maya's Theme\"! Phoenix: Um, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim's table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim! Maya: You're right! Phoenix: (So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...) Maya: I think we better step up the investigation, don't you Nick? After presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 6Trés Bien ???: Oh là là! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Trés Bien! Maya: Oh! Hel... lo... ... Phoenix: (What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...) ???: Bienvenue! Welcome to my petite restauranté! Maya: Huh? \"Bee Avenue\"? ???: Oh, non, my petite chulip! Maya: Huh? Me? ???: Look at z'is face! Like la kitten rejected by its own mother. You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil mélange of la néroli and la rose. My personal recommendation! Maya: You think I need what...? ???: Oui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voilá! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique! Maya: Really? ???: And for la monsieur! Phoenix: Who? Me? ???: Look at z'at face! Like la puppy rejected by life itself! You are fatigued, non? For you, monsieur, I recommend z'is! Oil of bergamot. And maybe a 'int of... Oui, oui! I will add la peppermint and la clary sage for a fragrance exceptionnel! Such an invigorating recipe will bring out your delicious beauty, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My beauty!? ???: Alors. If you will be seated, I will bring you la special menu of z'e day! Phoenix: Actually, we're not here to eat. We're lawyers. ???: Mais bien sûr! I know z'is already, monsieur. You are la Phoenix Wright, non? Phoenix: Um, yes... You know me? ???: Mais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court! Maya: I guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp... Phoenix: It looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already. Maya: I wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you? Armstrong: Allow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté! Talk Trés Bien Maya: So what does \"Trés Bien\" mean? I know \"trés\". That means \"three\", right? Armstrong: Non, non, non! \"Trés Bien\" is Français! In English, you would say, \"Very Good\". Maya: Oh. Very good... Armstrong: Oui, exactement! La atmosphere is trés bien, and la cuisine is trés bien! Phoenix: (If the food's good, why aren't there any customers in here?) Armstrong: My cuisine is not for all. Some people, z'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine. Phoenix: (I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...) Armstrong: Since I 'ave lost Maggey, I do not 'ave enough 'ands. Phoenix: So, you're running this place on your own now? Armstrong: Oui. For la moment. No one 'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi! Phoenix: (... Please don't eyeball me while you say that.) Armstrong: I am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist. Maya: A roaming what? Armstrong: A practitioner d'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z'e delicate floral aromas. Phoenix: (Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...) What happened Phoenix: So, could you tell me what you know about the incident? Armstrong: Bien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z'an a month 'as passed since it 'appened. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess it's been about a month since Maggey's sentencing...) Armstrong: So. It was z'e third of last month. Just after one in z'e afternoon. A man who was in 'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill. Phoenix: Because of the poison in his coffee? Armstrong: Z'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took 'is drink to 'im. I was in la kitchen. I 'eard z'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, 'e was already slumped in 'is chair. Maya: He was dead? Armstrong: Mon dieu! Oui! 'E was dead! Maggey 'ad passed out also. Phoenix: And this man who died... Was he alone? Armstrong: Oui, monsieur. All alone. I know z'at Maggey said z'ere was someone else, but... Maya: I see... Armstrong: La police, z'ey asked me many times. \"Are you sure z'ere was no one else at z'e table?\" z'ey asked. But I am not z'e only one. La old man said z'e same thing. Phoenix: Old man? What old man? Old man (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Um... So who is the old man that you mentioned? Armstrong: At z'e time of la murder, z'ere was another customer in 'ere. Maya: What!? Someone else saw it? Armstrong: Mais, oui! As usual, 'e came alone z'at day. At z'e time of la murder, 'e was 'ere. 'E saw it, too. But 'e said z'e same thing, z'at z'ere was no one else at la victim's table. Maya: But Maggey swears there were two people! Armstrong: Mais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, 'e could not prove z'is, non? Phoenix: About the lawyer. That was me, I suppose? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr! Phoenix: ... Wow! He's the first person who's said it wasn't me. Maya: Don't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!? Maggey's motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile) Phoenix: When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen? Armstrong: Ou... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so. Phoenix: So what happened? Armstrong: Non. It was, er... It was nothing. Maya: Look, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive! Armstrong: Oui. It is true. Phoenix: If there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant. Maya: So please! Tell us anything you know. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock!?] in the original release) Maya: No way! What are we going to do, Nick? Phoenix: We'll just have to remov... WHAT THE!? Maya: Wh-What's wrong? Phoenix: The Magatama... It's gone! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: I had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air! Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (But I could see the Psyche-Locks. (Changed from [But I could see the Psyche-Lock.] in the original release) Maybe that means the Magatama's nearby...?) Maggey's motive (subsequent times) Phoenix: Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim. 3 PSYCHE LOCKS Armstrong: N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qué será, será. Perhaps Maggey 'ad another reason. Phoenix: (What's Maggey's motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock [sic] must mean it's nearby.) Maya: I only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK? Phoenix: (...And here I thought it was mine to keep!) Present Attorney's Badge Armstrong: Please, monsieur. Z'ere is no need to show me z'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z'e worst defense lawyer in town. Phoenix: (I think I can imagine how he formed this completely wrong impression of me...) Um, the last time we met, did I show you this badge? Armstrong: Oui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant! Maya: Looks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick! Magazine Clipping Armstrong: I am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z'at day was a little, how you say, \"lacking\", per'aps? Phoenix: *sigh* Armstrong: Even a Frenchman who cannot speak any English could 'ave done a better job! You were very cool, though. Oh, oui, oui! So 'andsome. Maya: Wow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been... Armstrong: Every time you opened your mouth, z'e 'ole courthouse stirred. Phoenix: (Oh, man. That is something I don't want to imagine...) Sports Paper Phoenix: We found this sports paper in the magazine rack here. Armstrong: One of my customers must 'ave left it behind. Maya: Do you have any idea which customer it was? Armstrong: Z'e only ideas I 'ave, mademoiselle, I save for my kitchen! Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: If you want a job 'ere, it is yours, precious! Mia Fey profile Armstrong: Mon dieu! What beauty! Maya: That's my sister! Armstrong: Ah, oui? Another delight! But you 'ave a certain je ne sais quois z'at I do not sense from your sister. Maya: I do? Armstrong: So throw your head 'ead 'igh! Thrust out your feminine features! Do not lose 'eart, ma fille! You are a woman! A woman extraordinaire! Maya: Do I look like I need cheering up or something? Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Maggey was a policewoman once, n'est-ce pas? Phoenix: Yes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control. Armstrong: Oui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non? Maya: Oh... You know about that? Armstrong: Z'at is why I gave to 'er la perfume for la 'appiness. Phoenix: Happiness perfume? Armstrong: Oui. Blended from bergamot, like I 'ave given to you before. Phoenix: But she's been arrested again. And found guilty this time. Armstrong: Z'is is true. 'Er natural aroma of un'appiness must 'ave been very strong. Phoenix: (Just admit it! Your perfume doesn't work!) Armstrong: I am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z'at took place before my very eyes. Maya: Something like what? Phoenix: (What's this guy talking about!?) Maya: Does this mean... Maggey did have a motive? Phoenix: We've got to ask this guy for more info, stat! Jean Armstrong profile Armstrong: It is 'ard to imagine, I know, but I was an apprentice for five years in la gay Paris. Maya: Wow! In Paris!? Armstrong: It was something la chef z'ere said to me z'at made me decide to open my own restaurant. Phoenix: What was it? Armstrong: Z'at awful man said to me, \"You must train for another ten years!\" Oh! It was such a shock! So unexpected! But you would 'ave to be a fool to do z'is, non? Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Armstrong: Félicitations! Mais... qu'est-ce que c'est? Phoenix: Ack! Um... Je... Je no comprehend... Maya: Nick! Don't just make something up! After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there? Armstrong: ... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves. Maya: Huh? \"'Im\"? Armstrong: La old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc. Phoenix: La p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that? Armstrong: Behind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\". Maya: Thank you! Armstrong: Je vous en prie, my dear! Maya: Let's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick! January 6Vitamin Square Maya: So this is Vitamin Square. Phoenix: Yeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you. Maya: Hey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about? Phoenix: That grouchy-looking grandpa? Maya: He's throwing seeds out for the pigeons. Phoenix: Maya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them! Old Man: ... Phoenix: (Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...) Examine Sandbox Maya: I used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe! Phoenix: Really? You? Maya: Sure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do. Phoenix: Iron filings? Wow... That's too exciting for words. Maya: It was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then! Phoenix: So, did you manage to get all the iron? Maya: No, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them? Phoenix: No. Fruit attractions Maya: This place is so fruity! Phoenix: That's not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They're among my favorites. Maya: Then that apple slide is perfect for you! Phoenix: ... And what is so \"perfect\" about it? Maya: Oh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo! Phoenix: No way! I'd get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that. Maya: Yeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too. Pigeons Maya: Hey, look. Pigeons! Phoenix: Yeah. And heaps of them, too. Maya: Did you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace? Phoenix: That's a dove, not a pigeon. Maya: ... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony? Phoenix: You're over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya. Magazine on orange-themed seat Maya: Ooh, there's a magazine here. Phoenix: It's a magazine full of job listings. Old Man: You disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away! Phoenix: \"Threw away\"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job? Old Man: Kah! That's none of your business! Phoenix: Sorry! I guess I'll take the magazine with me then. Old Man: I don't want anyone else having it! Give it back! Phoenix: (Too bad. Now that you want it so bad, I don't want to give it up!) Job Listings added to the Court Record. Old Man: Hey! That's mine! Closer orange-themed seat (after examining magazine on orange-themed seat) Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: You don't have to tell me twice. Talk What you saw Phoenix: Um... Excuse me. Old Man: ... Phoenix: Would you mind if I had a word with you? Old Man: Yes! Phoenix: I just want to ask you a couple of questions... Old Man: What's the matter with you!? Can't you see I'm busy? So you don't like my seeds, eh, pigeons!? Phoenix: (He's really chucking those seeds at them! That's got to hurt!) Old Man: Go on! Eat this! Phoenix: (*sigh*) Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Maya: Yes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Kah! It's a disgrace, I tell you. An utter disgrace! Maya: A disgrace? Old Man: An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: Revealing!? You mean her uniform? Old Man: The youth of today! They don't have any shame! No shame, I tell you! Not one ounce! Whatever happened to the old bushido values of Japan, like honor and modesty? Maya: What about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing. Old Man: You!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace! Maya: Talk about hitting a girl where it hurts... Trés Bien Phoenix: Do you go to Trés Bien a lot? Old Man: Hmph! That miserable excuse for a restaurant? That garbage they serve in there's not food. Where's the sushi? The tempura? The rice!? Phoenix: Trés Bien is a French restaurant, sir... Old Man: Where do you think we are, boy? In Paris!? I want real food, not those snooty snacks! And what about those shameless girls!? Phoenix: You mean the waitresses? Old Man: You can see all the way up to their... their... Yes! The waitresses! They're practically naked! It's a disgrace, isn't it? Well, isn't it!? Phoenix: Listen, it's not my restaurant. Old Man: Kah! It's a miserable excuse for a restaurant, that place! Miserable! Phoenix: (He certainly knows the place. He must be a regular! But if he hates it so much, why does he keep going?) Trés Bien regular (appears after \"Trés Bien\") Maya: Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir? Old Man: ... Maya: It's just, if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Maya: He must be hiding something, right? Phoenix: If he is, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock... Oh, wait... I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... Maya: Remember, Nick. That Magatama is only on loan. You better find it or else! Phoenix: (If Pearls ever gets wind of this, I'm going to be in a world of pain...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, excuse me, sir. Could I just ask you about this... Old Man: ... Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: Here you go, boy! How does some pigeon feed sound to you!? Phoenix: (This wasn't exactly what I was hoping to get out of this guy...) Detention Center Present Job Listings Maya: Um, Maggey... Byrde: Oh, are you looking for some part-time work, Maya? Why don't you take a job at the restaurant? I bet Mr. Armstrong would hire you. Maya: Really? Me? Byrde: It's pretty cool being a waitress, you know. And in the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets! Maya: What secrets...? Byrde: You can't make it obvious, but just spy on him for a bit. You'll see. It's interesting. Maya: Wow! I can't wait to get my apron on now! Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Oh, so you met the owner, Mr. Armstrong! Phoenix: He's, um... Oh, how can I put this... pretty unique, huh? Byrde: He has a really intense aura. As a chef and as a person. Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Trés Bien Examine Cash register (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's really tight behind the cash register counter. Can Mr. Armstrong even get in there? And if he got in... could he get out again? Trinkets (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: There's a bunch of little trinkets on a shelf by the door. I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Magazine rack (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Ugh. All the clothes in these are absolutely atrocious! ...Some of them have been circled in red. ... I really hope Mr. Armstrong is not thinking of buying those. Table (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong must be a pretty big neat-freak. He already has this table ready to go. Now if only the food in this place was edible... Windows (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It looks pretty cold out there on the streets. Peaceful, though. It's nice that people can take it easy after the holiday rush. Crime scene (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: This must be the table where the poisoning occurred. The stain tells the story well. The whole area is still cordoned off with police tape. I guess it must still be under investigation. Present Job Listings Armstrong: Mademoiselle! Maya: Y-Yes? Armstrong: Are you looking for la job? Maya: What!? N-No, no. I was just... Armstrong: Let me see. Your style is un peu différent, but you 'ave a good face. Maya: ...Different? Armstrong: Félicitations! You 'ave passed! I will 'ire you! Bien! Come wiz me. I will teach you everyz'ing I know! Maya: N-Nick! HEEEEEELP! Phoenix: (I don't know whether to laugh or feel bad for Maya... Maybe I should do both...?) Vitamin Square Examine Sandbox Phoenix: When I think back to when I was young... ...I wonder what I found so great about playing in a sandbox. Maybe I'll come back here in the middle of the night one of these days to relive it. ... On second thought, being arrested by Gumshoe would be too embarrassing to bear. Fruit attractions Phoenix: You don't see many parks like this anymore. What a great place for kids to play. But that old man's the only one here, chucking his seeds at the pigeons. Pigeons Phoenix: The pigeons are so busy pecking at the seeds, they don't notice anything else. Seeing those birds eat with such intense focus... ...reminds me of Maya when she's scarfing down a burger. Closer orange-themed seat Phoenix: This is where I found that job listings magazine before. A guy like me carrying around a magazine like that kind of gives the wrong impression. I guess I better give it back to that old man once this investigation's over. Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Yes, you do. You know, the waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Hmph! If you ask me It's a disgrace! Th-That's what it is! An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: So, you didn't like that kind of thing, then? Old Man: ... Wh-What are you trying to say about me, boy!? Explain yourself! Phoenix: Um, nothing! I'm not saying anything about you... Old Man: I know your kind! You young ones with your spiky hair and your fancy suits! That heads of yours is over-flowing with filthy ideas! Phoenix: (...I know someone who needs to learn some stress management.) Old Man: Get out of here, you young brat! Trés Bien regular Phoenix: So, you are a regular at that restaurant, right, sir? Old Man: ... Phoenix: You're always complaining about the place, so why do you go there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Phoenix: (Something's not right about this guy... But If he's hiding something, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock.) Oh, wait... (I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... I need to find it before I can get anywhere with this old man.) After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Looks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later. Examine Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. There's nothing for him to do right now, so he's catching some vertical z's. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Poor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Trés Bien once things have cooled off. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Well, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!? Phoenix: Um, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation. Gumshoe: Well, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's really fired up about this...) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor... Phoenix: (Oh. ... Him.) Gumshoe: Now, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again... Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Gumshoe: Um... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!? Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Hitting the gas is like hitting the fast-forward button on your life.\" No. That's too obscure. You don't really get the \"you'll die before your time\" idea. I need something more direct. Something a bit more light-hearted. Something like, \"Hitting the gas is your passport to paradise!\" Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT!? Poisoned coffee waitress gets a retrial!? I knew it! I knew there was something funny about the taste of this coffee! OK! Who brought me this coffee today? Hands up! Phoenix: (Yeesh! Have a little faith in your subordinates!) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Phoenix: No matter what, whenever I come here, that mascot's there to greet me. Chief: You got that right. That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Phoenix: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're married. Phoenix: (So should I expect to see Baby Badger next time I'm here...?) Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: So the guilty party was Maggey Byrde, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah... Phoenix: Back when she was on the police force... ...you were her mentor when she was a rookie, right? Gumshoe: Yeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened. Phoenix: (Gumshoe sure is sweating up a storm over nothing... ...Ah, so that's it! Our big ol' Gumshoe has a little ol' crush on Maggey!) Gumshoe: I... I don't like her or anything! I... I was... Aaaargh! Phoenix: (Note to self: Gossip with Maya about this later!) Gumshoe: Look, pal! Don't tell anyone, OK!? You've gotta keep it a secret, got it!? Phoenix: S-Sure... And would you mind not guessing what I'm thinking all the time? Gumshoe: Hey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind. The victim Phoenix: So I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim? Gumshoe: Glen Elg, he was a computer programmer. Phoenix: I see. A programmer... Gumshoe: He was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal. Phoenix: (Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often? Gumshoe: Not according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy. Phoenix: (A programmer... and a first-time customer at that...) (Changed from [A programmer... and a first-time customer...] in the original release) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that? Gumshoe: That's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial. Phoenix: You're kidding! What was her supposed \"motive\"? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK? Phoenix: (What could this motive have been...?) The investigation Gumshoe: This isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself. Phoenix: O-Oh, that's right... Gumshoe: The judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony. Phoenix: Yeah... Doesn't sound very good for us, huh? Gumshoe: Look, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop. Phoenix: (That's not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony? Contradictions (appears after \"The investigation\") Gumshoe: The biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table. Phoenix: Yeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim. Gumshoe: Right. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD... Phoenix: (CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...) Byrde: And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Gumshoe: But our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD. Phoenix: What? Gumshoe: Not on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal. Phoenix: But didn't Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too? Gumshoe: Yeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie. Phoenix: A radio? He didn't have a CD player? Gumshoe: You got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all. Phoenix: (Come to think of it... The owner of Trés Bien didn't mention that CD either. I don't know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong's got something to hide...) The charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile) Phoenix: So what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Trés Bien? Gumshoe: It's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected with the case anyway... Phoenix: Hey, come on, Detective. Didn't you say you'd give me the dirt on anything? Gumshoe: Well, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stuff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK? Phoenix: Um... Don't suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Trés Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.) Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? (I've got to track this creep down!) Magazine Clipping Gumshoe: I wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was. Phoenix: And what did he say? Gumshoe: He started off by saying, \"I'm at a complete loss for words...\" But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour. Phoenix: But... Gumshoe: He said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty! Phoenix: (It looked like I was \"trying to get Maggey found guilty\"...?) Sports Paper Gumshoe: What's that? A sports paper? Phoenix: Yeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Gumshoe: It's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here. Phoenix: And take a look at this. See this writing here? Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... Hey! Phoenix: What is it? Gumshoe: I've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Gumshoe: Hey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble. Phoenix: (Handwriting, huh? It'd be good to know more about that, in any case...) Gumshoe: Thanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue! Sports Paper given to Detective Gumshoe. Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: Hey! So how come she's not with you today? Phoenix: She's working down at the restaurant right now. Gumshoe: Working, huh? Yeah, it's tough being broke. I would know. Phoenix: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: Next time I see her, I'll show her how to make the world's best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It's the only way! Phoenix: (Um... Why is he shaking my hand with such enthusiasm...?) Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Phoenix: What? Mia did? Gumshoe: Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Godot profile Gumshoe: That's the guy who's gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey's retrial tomorrow. Phoenix: O-Oh, really? Gumshoe: He was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal. Phoenix: (Why's that guy so determined to see me fail?) Gumshoe: You sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind. Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything. Phoenix: It's OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right. Gumshoe: ... You know what? You're not such a bad guy after all, pal. Maggey Byrde profile Phoenix: Have you gone to see Maggey? Gumshoe: Of course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words. Phoenix: Oh... Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to. Phoenix: (Did he go for her, or for himself...?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: The chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Phoenix: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day. Phoenix: Under orders? Old Man: Yeah. You know, there's something about the lady... I mean, guy. Phoenix: Huh!? You can't stop thinking about him!? Gumshoe: Not like that, pal! Gimme a break! He's not my type. I mean, I can't stop thinking that he's involved with this case somehow! Phoenix: (Sounds like he knows a little something more about our charming chef.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you make of this...? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant... Phoenix: (You don't have to explain... Really...) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.: January 6Trés Bien Phoenix: The scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...) ???: Ah! Welcome! Bee avenue! Phoenix: (Wow. What a cute voice.) Maya: Oh, it's just you, Nick. Phoenix: M-Maya! Maya: Well? How do I look? Phoenix: ... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium... Maya: Maybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer. Phoenix: (Then who was that woman I just saw?) Maya: Oh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat! Phoenix: ... I am kind of hungry, actually. Talk Waitress Phoenix: So, how do you like your new job, Maya? Maya: I never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people's orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that. Phoenix: Yeah, it's a nice-looking restaurant. It's a shame more people don't come. Maya: Don't forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my \"gimme a tip\" smile! Lunch special Maya: Hey, Nick! Why don't you order something? The chef's preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says. Phoenix: How much is it? Maya: It's the Twin-T set. So it's 20 dollars, of course. Phoenix: The Twin-T set? I believe I'll be taking a pass. It's kind of expensive. Maya: What!? But you can't! Come on, Nick! It's not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register! Phoenix: How about cleaning the toilets? That should keep you busy. Maya: Yeah, right! Maybe later. Present Anything Phoenix: About this... Maya: Sorry, Nick! I'm a waitress now. I've got a pile of work waiting for little ol' me. After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um... About the lunch... Maya: Oh! A fine choice, sir. Phoenix: No. I, um... Maya: KITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT! Phoenix: I don't need any of that! Maya: Just a moment, please, sir. Phoenix: (Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya! Maya: Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set! Phoenix: Whoa! Maya: A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit! Phoenix: Um, thanks...? Maya: Come on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already! Phoenix: (Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp! Maya: Well? Phoenix: Are you hungry, Maya? Maya: I'm starving! Phoenix: Here. It's yours. Maya: Really!? ... Urp! Phoenix: Remember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate! Maya: ... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets! Phoenix: Hey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!) Trés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record. Phoenix: How does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad? Maya: Hey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen? Phoenix: (The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.) Talk Kitchen Phoenix: Hmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? \"In the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!\" Maya: In the kitchen? Mmm. That sounds tasty! Phoenix: Hey, wait up! Maya! Maya: What is it? I'm pretty busy right now. Phoenix: Weren't you going to show me around? Maya: Tsk. There goes my plan to find some cool clue and show it off in your face... Phoenix: (I'd better conduct the search in the kitchen myself!) After clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Trés Bien: January 6Trés BienKitchen Maya: And here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually. Phoenix: ... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure. Maya: Mr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop! Examine Mirror Maya: Now THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty. Phoenix: There's a book on the dresser. \"Claurice Armstrong's Bedtime Literature\". Maya: Not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it? Phoenix: It looks like a collection of poems he's written. Maya: Poems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK? Phoenix: OK, um... Here's one. Ahem! It's called, \"Printemps\". \"Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must.\" Maya: Huh? That's it!? Phoenix: Yup. That's a poem for you. Oil bottles Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: There's one bottle that's different from all the others. Phoenix: Well what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either. Maya: And... *sniff* It doesn't smell. Phoenix: (So what's that liquid inside then, I wonder?) Maya: Hey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he? Small Bottle added to the Court Record. Oil bottles (subsequent times) Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Lace curtains Phoenix: What are these lace curtains for? Maya: I don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those. Phoenix: (How do you respond to something like that!?) Table Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter! Maya: My Magatama! What's it doing there!? Phoenix: (What indeed...) Magatama put into pocket. Table (subsequent times) Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Maya: And look at these knives. They look really sharp! Phoenix: I'd like to see how one of those slices through a cheesecake. Maya: A cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick. Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I just ate for lunch? Maya: Maybe... What you ate is the only French dish I know the name of. After examining oil bottles in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Hey, you're just in time! Phoenix: What is it, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: The lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me. Phoenix: (He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything? Gumshoe: They said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it. Phoenix: (I expected as much...) Gumshoe: The victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment. Sports Paper refiled into the Court Record. Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal? Phoenix: (Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...) Talk Armstrong's secret (appears after presenting Small Bottle) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes... Gumshoe: So, how was it? Phoenix: To put it nicely... it was inedible. Gumshoe: Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so... Phoenix: Yeah... I guess it's probably the food. Gumshoe: The real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt. Phoenix: Really? How much does he owe? Gumshoe: This is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red. Phoenix: H-Half a million? Are we talking dollars? Gumshoe: Yeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble! Phoenix: Sorry. That figure just took me by surprise. Gumshoe: Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch. Jean's Loan Contract added to the Court Record. Armstrong's secret (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes...

That figure just took me by surprise. Gumshoe: Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch. Present Sports Paper Gumshoe: So according to the boys down at the lab, the doodles were probably made by the victim. Phoenix: Probably? Gumshoe: Analyzing this kind of writing is difficult since it's done with a fiber-tipped pen. But don't worry! I'll vouch for it. Phoenix: (Why would Gumshoe have to vouch for it? Can't it stand on its own?) Small Bottle Gumshoe: You got one of those aroma bottles too, huh? Phoenix: Only this one doesn't smell. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get you... Phoenix: This was mixed in with all the other aromatherapy bottles, but it's not the same. It doesn't even look the same, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: A cologne bottle that doesn't smell, huh? Smells like a skunk to me, pal! Mind letting me borrow that bottle for a while? I wanna send it to the lab for analysis. Phoenix: (The victim was poisoned, so the contents of this bottle are pretty important...) Small Bottle given to Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: I had a lunch there was something funny about that chef. Phoenix: You suspect Jean Armstrong? Gumshoe: I've got that guy's number. I know what his secret is. Phoenix: (That must be the same secret Gumshoe was talking about before.) Gumshoe: I guess I'd better fill you in on the details. About this Armstrong guy's secret, I mean... Jean's Loan Contract Gumshoe: It's for half a million dollars, pal! That's... um... half a million dollar bills! Phoenix: (What was the \"um\" in there for!?) Is there really that much money tied up in this case? Gumshoe: I can't give you an answer on that, pal. Not without the case file in front of me. But I'll tell you this... That Armstrong guy would've done anything for cash. He was desperate, you know? Phoenix: No, I don't. But I think I sort of get the picture. After examining table in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Vitamin Square Phoenix: Hmm, the old guy's not here anymore. (Drat. And I still have some unanswered questions for him.) Examine Motor scooter Leads to: \"A scooter, huh?\" Phoenix: A scooter, huh? Who'd leave it right in the middle of the park like this? The wheel guard and the light are busted... I guess it must have been in an accident. It's totally wrecked. ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!

Phoenix: Oh, it's you. Old Man: A few threats from a little brat like that... ...and you look like a pigeon that's got seeds in its eyes. Phoenix: Have you been here the whole time then? Old Man: I was in that strawberry. I had some thinking to do. Phoenix: (More like you had some cowering to do!) Talk Trés Bien regular Phoenix: Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir? Old Man: ... Phoenix: It's just if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it... This old guy has got something to hide. But what could it be?) Trés Bien regular (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Why are you a regular at a restaurant that you clearly hate, sir? Old Man: Take that, pigeons! See how you like these seeds! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (It's no good. I'm gonna have to break his Psyche-Lock. I just can't figure out what he would be hiding. I mean, I'm only asking him why he goes to a particular restaurant.) Trés Bien regular (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Um... Sir... Old Man: Yes, it's true! I was there for the young girl. Fine, so I'm a dirty, wicked, sinful old devil! Phoenix: No, no... I didn't mean it like that... Old Man: I even get one of those lousy cups of javaccino every time. For 8 dollars! All because of the serving girl! Punish me! Lock me up! Phoenix: Really, that's not what I'm here for. Old Man: You'll be the same! Another 20 years and you'll understand what it's like! You'll know how painful it is to be an old man like me! Phoenix: No, really. Listen, sir... Old Man: Stop calling me that! I have a name you know, boy! So show some respect, hmm!? I'm Victor Kudo. Phoenix: S-Sorry... Mr. Kudo. Kudo: You young ones think you know it all, don't you? Well, I'm not saying another word! I won't tell you anything more! Phoenix: (This guy was in the restaurant at the time of the incident. Which means I have to hear his testimony, one way or another!) Kudo: Hmph! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... I even broke his Psyche-Locks and everything... (Changed from [I don't believe this... I even broke his Psyche-Lock and everything...] in the original release) I guess I'll have to try to get him when he's in a better mood.) Any option (after breaking Psyche-Locks, then clearing \"Trés Bien regular\" Talk option) Phoenix: Mr. Kudo! Please! This is really important. Kudo: Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Hmm, pi-pi-pigeon, hmm... Kah! Phoenix: (Ack. He's really giving me the cold shoulder now. But this guy's an important witness. I can't afford to lose his testimony. There must be a way to soften him up...) Present Magatama (after clearing \"Trés Bien regular\" Talk option) Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Trés Bien regular -- Phoenix: It's time you told me the truth. Why are you a regular at a restaurant that you dislike so much? Old Man: Isn't it obvious!? People only have one reason to go to restaurants. To eat! Phoenix: To eat? Is that the whole truth? Old Man: Wh-What do you mean!? Phoenix: I don't think you go to that restaurant for the food at all. Old Man: You insolent brat! How dare you accuse me! What proof have you got!? Phoenix: I can tell that not you nor anyone else in the world would go to that place for its food. Present Lunch Special Phoenix: Leads to: \"The proof is in the pudding. Or in this case, the lunch menu.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? Old Man: Take this! Phoenix: Argh! Old Man: You're a disgrace! An idiot! A clot! A fool! You're only worthy of this pigeon feed! Phoenix: Ow! (Looks like that evidence wasn't it!) L-Listen... Leads back to: \"I don't think you go to that restaurant for the food at all.\" Phoenix: The proof is in the pudding. Or in this case, the lunch menu. Old Man: That's the Twin-T set! Phoenix: The food at Trés Bien is terrible. And expensive. Old Man: You're wrong. It's cheap. Phoenix: Huh? Old Man: I'm rich. I inherited money when I was a boy. Yes, I'm stinking rich! I haven't done a jot of work since I was born. Other than feeding the pigeons. Phoenix: (What a load of crock!) Old Man: The taste's another story, but the price... It's nothing to me. Phoenix: So, you're saying that you go there because you've got money to burn? Old Man: Exactly! I have so much cash, I go for a swim in my money vault every day! Phoenix: Unfortunately, that's a lie. Old Man: What!? Phoenix: You don't have money to burn. You're flat broke! Present Job Listings Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is yours, right?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Old Man: Disrespectful youth! Phoenix: Uh? Old Man: Take this! The finest seeds money can buy! Ha-ha!

So what!? 1 LOCK BROKEN Old Man: So I was looking for a job! I'm buying a lot at the moment. I need spending money. Phoenix: Oh? Old Man: I don't go to that restaurant for food. I just go for the javaccino. Phoenix: Yeah... I think you mean a cappuccino. Anyway, how much does a cappuccino cost there? Old Man: Eight dollars. Phoenix: (Those had better be some golden beans!) Old Man: What's your problem? You think a poor man would be better off drinking dishwater, do you? Is that it!? Phoenix: N-No. I wasn't thinking that. I was wondering if the coffee there is really that great... Old Man: No, it's not. But... But anyway! Yes! That place has free newspapers to read every day. Phoenix: Newspapers? Old Man: Exactly. They don't want me hanging around at home, so I go there. Phoenix: I'm sorry, sir... But there are no free papers to read at Trés Bien!

How do you like them seeds, hmm? Leads back to: \"But anyway! Yes! That place has free newspapers to read every day.\" Phoenix: Take a look at this. Old Man: What is it? Phoenix: It's a newspaper I found behind the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Old Man: So? What of it? Phoenix: This was the only paper there. And it's dated more than one month ago! Old Man: Wh-What!? Phoenix: Do you see what I'm getting at here? That restaurant doesn't get newspapers. This is just one that a customer happened to leave behind! Old Man: Ah... Aaaaaargh! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Tell me, why are you so determined to hide the truth? Old Man: I-I'm not hiding anything! Phoenix: (I'm going to have to put this guy out of his misery.) Listen...

Leads back to: \"Tell me, why are you so determined to hide the truth?\" Old Man: Wh-What are you asking me about that girl for? Phoenix: She was the waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Ah! Phoenix: Therefore, the answer to the mystery... ...of why an old man would drink expensive coffee at a terrible restaurant... ...is the waitress! Old Man: Argh! B-But I don't recognize that face! Phoenix: And you are probably telling the truth here. Because you weren't looking at the girl's face... But at her outfit! Old Man: *gulp* Phoenix: That's the truth, isn't it? You became a regular at the restaurant because of the waitress's uniform! That uniform is all you can think about, isn't it? Old Man: Uh... uh... I-I can't take it...

Gumshoe: It's OK, though. I don't mind guys like that. But, if he's involved with this case somehow, that's a different story. Phoenix: Um... sure. Gumshoe: Here's a tip for you, pal. If you wanna get information out of a guy like that... ...you're gonna have to find his weakness and try to get under his skin. Phoenix: (His weakness? I wonder what that might be...)

Phoenix: (It's like he's a different person...) Kudo: It was quite a shock! Even for me. He was a strange-looking boy. The girl took the javaccino over to him, you see. Mia: And... was the customer alone? Kudo: Definitely! He was the only person at the table. Then he took one sip of his javaccino, and... Mia: And? Kudo: And he said something like, \"Uaaaargh!\" and then collapsed. Dead. Mia: Oh, how terrifying! Kudo: You're so good at listening, aren't you? I'll tell you anything. Whatever you want to know! Hee hee hee. Phoenix: (He certainly seems to be telling the truth now. But it looks like Mr. Kudo didn't see this other man, either.) Trés Bien Mia: Do you like the food at Trés Bien? Kudo: Well, of course! I'm really quite a sophisticated man. I was a young businessman once, you know. I set up a casino in London! Mia: Really? How interesting! Kudo: Eating the food at that restaurant really takes me back to my days in France. Mia: What a lovely story. Phoenix: (London's in England, not France!) Kudo: Oh, yes! France is wonderful. I'd love to show you around the city some time! It-It's too much! I can't take it! I want... France! Mia: Ha ha ha!

Phoenix: (Mia's really got this guy eating out of her hand...) Kudo: He steals things. From his customers. Phoenix: From his customers? Kudo: Gloves, handkerchiefs... Little things, mainly. He's a pilferer! So you be careful around him, my dear. Mia: Are you sure about this? Kudo: Of course! He was arrested for it once. I was there when it happened, having my javaccino. Phoenix: (He really is a regular!) Kudo: Let me write you a little haiku about it. Phoenix: A haiku? Kudo: A Japanese poem. It'll explain all you need to know about that chef. Victor's Note added to the Court Record. Kudo: If he takes anything again, you let me know! If it's not too expensive, I'll buy you a replacement! Phoenix: (Poor guy. He couldn't do enough for Mia.)

Talk Maggey's motive Phoenix: When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen? Armstrong: M-Monsieur... I cannot... Phoenix: Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Armstrong: N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Phoenix: (Somehow... I've gotta get this guy to spill the beans on everything he knows.) Maggey's motive (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong.

I was so desperately in need of money, so I... Phoenix: Put the poison in his coffee? Armstrong: Non, non, non, non, non! Oh, non, you naughty man! I simply 'elped myself to one of 'is tickets. Maya: What? Armstrong: La victim collapsed, and Maggey passed out. I thought to myself, \"Pourquoi pas?\" 'E 'ad so many of zem. Phoenix: (Yeah, but only one of them was the winning ticket, right?)

Armstrong: Mademoiselle Maya. Please, you must read la menu more carefully. It says, \"A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with a balsamic vinaigrette. Maya: Oh. It's only inspired, is it? Armstrong: Oui. Inspired by z'ese ingredients, but not per'aps made from z'em, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Well, guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, Nick.

Phoenix: H-HALF A MILLION!? Armstrong: Oui. But after la incident, z'is ticket... It disappeared! Phoenix: (The ticket disappeared...?) Armstrong: Z'is was la motive z'at la prosecution gave for Maggey. Z'ey said z'at she poisoned the man to get ze 'alf a million dollar lottery ticket. Phoenix: Why didn't you tell me about this sooner? Armstrong: Mais, alors... Phoenix: You've been trying to hide this information about the lottery ticket from me. And I want to know the reason why!

Aaah, bitter! Judge: Mr... Um... Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor? Judge: Aaaah! Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong!? Judge: Nothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating. Phoenix: No, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix. Judge: I see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he? Phoenix: (\"Our trusty\"...?) Judge: So, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please. Godot: Mr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today. Phoenix: But I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright! Godot: I wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out. Phoenix: (There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!) Judge: As everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial. Phoenix: (I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!) Judge: Now then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness. Godot: Let's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation? Gumshoe: ... Judge: Witness! State your name for the court! Gumshoe: Huh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe. Godot: Other way around, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir! Judge: Since yesterday? Gumshoe: Yeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now. Maya: I hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake. Judge: I see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case? Gumshoe: Y-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report. Judge: The court accepts this into evidence. Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Um... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress. Judge: The waitress being the accused? Gumshoe: Yeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo. Judge: Hmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me. Trés Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record. Godot: Come, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands. Judge: Now then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony. Gumshoe: Umm... Yes, sir... Witness Testimony -- The Incident -- Gumshoe: When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir. We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time. Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup. And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch! And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive. Judge: Hmm... Godot: Using the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady! Judge: The facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but... Phoenix: Yes? Judge: Please, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood? Phoenix: I already told you! That wasn't me! Cross Examination -- The Incident -- Gumshoe: When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Can I stop you for just a minute? Gumshoe: Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence? Phoenix: (He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's what she said. And I-- Godot: Godot: What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction? Phoenix: Hey! Godot: Sadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Well, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way. Godot: Ha...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Trés Bien, Trite! Phoenix: ...! Godot: I have here in my possession a ticket. Phoenix: A ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.) Godot: Yes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen. Judge: This is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct? Godot: I think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table? Phoenix: Urk! Judge: It certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Can I stop you for just a minute? Gumshoe: Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence? Phoenix: (He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's what she said. And I-- Godot: Godot: What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction?

They both said there was no other guy at the table. Judge: Hmm... Gumshoe: We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He was listening to his radio, you say? Gumshoe: Yeah. He had a portable radio in his chest pocket. Maya: Maggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\". Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: And what was it that the victim was listening to on the radio, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Huh? How should I know? Phoenix: (Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.) Maya: This isn't going very well, is it...? Judge: Hmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used? Leads back to cross-examination Gumshoe: Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else? Gumshoe: Not sure I get you, pal. Phoenix: Was the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder? Gumshoe: If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance. Phoenix: So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper... Godot: Godot: Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite? Gumshoe: The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: It seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee? Gumshoe: Huh!? What do you mean? Phoenix: According to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!? Gumshoe: Oh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think-- Godot: Godot: In case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there. Gumshoe: Huh? For me? Godot: \"Oh, hey! You're right!\"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence. Gumshoe: Th... THAT piece... sir? Godot: Yes. THAT piece. Gumshoe: ... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again? Godot: This! Phoenix: (Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?) Gumshoe: Oh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup. Godot: Yes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim. Judge: Oh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it. Godot: Conclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this! Phoenix: Uuuurgh! Gumshoe: For the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's. Coffee Cup added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Upon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance... Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else? Gumshoe: Not sure I get you, pal. Phoenix: Was the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder? Gumshoe: If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance. Phoenix: So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper... Godot: Godot: Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite? Gumshoe: The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: It seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee. Gumshoe: And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: (Potassium cyanide? I've heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: It's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history. Maya: How much is too much? Godot: A lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off. Maya: 0.2 grams? How much is that? Gumshoe: You know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much. Phoenix: (Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...) Judge: Hmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere. Gumshoe: And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Some kind of a motive\"? Gumshoe: Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion. Godot: Godot: You know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get it. Godot: I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out. Gumshoe: *gulp* Godot: So stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive? Phoenix: (Come on, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: She was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket. Phoenix: I knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.) Gumshoe: It disappeared from the scene of the crime. Godot: And it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million! Maya: Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one... Phoenix: (Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Wait a minute! The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client! Godot: Ha...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question! Judge: Th-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...? Gumshoe: One of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant. Phoenix: WH-WHAAAAAT!? Judge: Order! Order! Godot: Ha...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress. Judge: Y-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately! Phoenix: (Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...) Victim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record. Judge: The ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...? Godot: It's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor. Phoenix: (And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey's person...] in the original release) Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Victim's Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Some kind of a motive\"? Gumshoe: Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion. Godot: Godot: You know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get it. Godot: I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out. Gumshoe: *gulp* Godot: So stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive? Phoenix: (Come on, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: She was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket. Phoenix: I knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.) Gumshoe: It disappeared from the scene of the crime. Godot: And it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million! Maya: Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one... Phoenix: (Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?) Maya: You really think there are any contradictions in this testimony? Phoenix: To be honest, I don't know. Maya: But Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line? Phoenix: (I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.) After selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements: Judge: That's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime. Godot: I like an old man who knows the score. Judge: There is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules! Godot: I don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money. Maya: Not good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast. Phoenix: Yeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already. Godot: I'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence. Phoenix: (He's got more evidence against Maggey!?) Godot: This is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time. Maya: Wow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen... Phoenix: Th-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?) Godot: Ha...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself. Phoenix: The coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye... Godot: Of course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more. Judge: Something else? I presume you mean... Godot: Of course. I'm referring to the pocket. Phoenix: The... pocket? Godot: A search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket! Phoenix: A bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket? Gumshoe: Yeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it. Phoenix: WHAAAT!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence. Apron added to the Court Record. Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record. Judge: There's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court? Godot: Bloodstain? What bloodstain would that be? Judge: Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron! Godot: That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain! Phoenix: (You don't need to be told! Just look at it!) Godot: Well, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!? Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir. Phoenix: Ketchup!? Gumshoe: She must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day. Judge: ... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe! Godot: Pull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness! Gumshoe: Unnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already. Judge: Hmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case. Phoenix: ...! Judge: The motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established. Godot: Well, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all. Phoenix: (Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!) Judge: Witness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there. Witness Testimony -- The Investigation -- Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir. Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her. The victim didn't have any identification on him. But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly. When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison. And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene. Judge: Hmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good. Godot: Last chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite! Phoenix: ...! Godot: Don't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin! Cross Examination -- The Investigation -- Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Scary old man\", Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: There's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened. Phoenix: (Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...) Gumshoe: Officers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. \"What took you so long!?\" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds... Judge: Hmm... Seeds... Godot: Ha...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth. Phoenix: (I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...) Godot: The old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime. Gumshoe: Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How long was the defendant unconscious for? Gumshoe: The officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself. Phoenix: (I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...) Gumshoe: I woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful. Phoenix: (You're a professional detective, Gumshoe. Not a professional bird watcher!) Godot: Save the romantics for your own time, Detective. All we need to know about is the investigation. Gumshoe: Oops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I? Gumshoe: The victim didn't have any identification on him. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then? Gumshoe: No, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet. Phoenix: Fifty-eight cents...? Gumshoe: Yeah. I can't believe I found someone with less in their wallet than me, pal! Judge: The victim sounds like he was a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... Why not give him a bit of an edge? Phoenix: (I think I'm on to something here...) Gumshoe: But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...) Gumshoe: There was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket. Godot: It seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Trés Bien. Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?) Leave it Phoenix: (I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the prescription bag Phoenix: So what sort of medicine was in the bag? Gumshoe: Well... Actually, the bag we found was empty. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Yeah. Completely empty. Phoenix: (It was completely empty...?) Victim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record. Godot: Ha...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence? Desperate, are you, Trite? Phoenix: ...! Godot: Now, what happened with the investigation after that, Detective? Leads back to cross-examination Ask about his health insurance Phoenix: So, the victim had no form of identification on him, correct? Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: And yet, before arriving at the restaurant, he went to see a doctor. Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him! Judge: Oh! That is very true! Phoenix: The fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen! Godot: Ha...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with! Phoenix: Huh? Judge: Hmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... A bit of an edge never hurt anyone. Maya: Looks like we're off course again, Nick. Judge: Witness. Please continue with your testimony. Explain for the court the events following the preliminary investigation. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Victim's Prescription Bag is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...)

Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court. Gumshoe: When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But the defendant had been passed out for a while, correct? In that case... Isn't it possible someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket!? Gumshoe: Hey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal! Judge: Hmm... Gumshoe: It happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes! Godot: Godot: Keep up this crazy testimony, Detective, and those shoes will end up down your throat! Gumshoe: Sorry... Godot: So, Trite. \"Someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket\"...? That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence? Phoenix: Um... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...) Judge: It appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness. Gumshoe: And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for. Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: Interesting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh? Phoenix: (And they're just going to let him get away with it...?) Judge: It was just one dollar, Detective. Maya: I guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe. Present Victim's Prescription Bag Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you.\" Phoenix: If I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict! Maya: Gumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something! Phoenix: Yeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious. Maya: Come on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony. Gumshoe: Oho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you? Phoenix: You testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later? Gumshoe: Um, no. They didn't. Phoenix: The victim was given a prescription right before going to Trés Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!? Gumshoe: Y-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!! Judge: I-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!? Gumshoe: I, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh? Phoenix: The victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself! Judge: O-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that? Godot: Ha...! That's all. Phoenix: What!? Godot: Read for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will. Phoenix: What's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological? Judge: Just what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot? Godot: Hardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say. Judge: A war wound? Godot: The day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum. Phoenix: He ruptured his eardrum!? Judge: Then what on earth was the prescription he was given? Godot: It was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested! Phoenix: What!? Godot: It's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear. Judge: Yes. Here it is. In very, very fine print. Godot: It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication. Phoenix: Uuurgh... Judge: It seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all. Phoenix: N-No... Maya: Nick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over! Phoenix: (She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?) Push the medication issue Leads to: \"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\" Leave it Phoenix: It does seem as it the medication isn't connected to the case. Godot: Ha...! Maybe the last Mr. Trite was the real one. At least he didn't waste time. Judge: Indeed... If you have nothing further to add to this medication issue... ...the facts of this case seem no different to those presented on the last trial. I would therefore have no choice but to hand down my verdict. Phoenix: Uh... Umm...! Maya: Nick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground! Judge: Now then... Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Your Honor! Actually, this prescription... is absolutely pivotal to the case! Judge: Mr. Wright! Did you not just say the exact opposite only moments ago!? Phoenix: (Gotta lose a few battles in order to win the war, I suppose.) Leads to: \"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\" Phoenix: Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!? Godot: ...! Judge: But the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal! Phoenix: Phoenix: That doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth! Godot: Godot: You know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide. Phoenix: Phoenix: It hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable! Godot: Aaargh! Judge: That's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call? Godot: ... Judge: Mr. Godot...? Godot: ... Gumshoe: Um... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder. Phoenix: (Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?) Judge: Very well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me. Maya: Yay! Good job, Nick! Judge: The court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness. Godot: Ha...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups. Judge: Court is adjourned for recess! January 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Maya: Phew! That was close! Phoenix: Tell me about it... I nearly died in there! Byrde: That's my line, sir! Maya: No! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit. Byrde: Looks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!? Maya: Huh? Byrde: He said he'd help me. But he totally set me up! Phoenix: I don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right? Byrde: It's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again! Phoenix: (Poor Gumshoe...) Maya: So the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right? Phoenix: Yeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds! Byrde: I bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know? Maya: Yeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds! January 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: Court will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please. Godot: The prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand. Godot: Name and occupation, if you don't mind. Kudo: The name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too. Phoenix: We don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation. Kudo: My occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!? Phoenix: Kimono embroidery? Kudo: That's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed! Maya: Wow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime. Kudo: Anyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile! Phoenix: (That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...) Judge: Now then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident? Kudo: Oh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino. Judge: Seeds? Kudo: What do you think these are, hmm!? Judge: I-I see... Godot: So you saw everything that happened, gramps? Kudo: Did I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all! Godot: Then please, tell the court. We're all ears. Kudo: Sure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail! Phoenix: (He's really getting into this...) Witness Testimony -- What I Witnessed -- Kudo: The young man was reading the sports paper. The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed. That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well! Judge: Mr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress. Kudo: Kah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!? Judge: N-Newfangled? Kudo: All this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you! Judge: E-Excuse me... Kudo: Listen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away! Judge: Well, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Cross Examination -- What I Witnessed -- Kudo: The young man was reading the sports paper. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you saw the victim, then? You saw Mr. Glen Elg? Kudo: I wanted to know if Gusten Brawn retained his championship or not. Phoenix: (So he was looking at the sports paper the victim was reading, huh...) And at the location in question... ...there are partitions between tables on the same side of the restaurant, right? Kudo: So what if there are? Phoenix: If you say that you could see the victim... ...that means you were sitting at a table on the other side of the restaurant, correct? Kudo: Kah! I go to that place to drink javaccino! I don't go to sit! I don't remember what table I was sitting at! Phoenix: (You mean you go there to eye the waitress!) Kudo: The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw? Kudo: Victor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i! Phoenix: I see... Kudo: My eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving. Phoenix: (...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.) Kudo: And I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well! Phoenix: (I bet I know what's coming up and something tells me I'm not going to like it...) Leave it Phoenix: (It'd be dangerous to press this too much. I'd better ignore it for now.) So, what happened next? Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Your Honor. We need more clarification on what was put into the victim's coffee. I'd like to ask that the witness add what he knows about this to his testimony. Judge: Hmm... I agree. Witness, will you enlighten us, please? Kudo: Sure, sure. Adds statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\" Press (after adding statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw? Kudo: Victor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i! Phoenix: I see... Kudo: My eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving. Phoenix: (...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.) Kudo: And I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well! Kudo: There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: D-Did she really put that into the coffee? Kudo: You doubt me, boy!? She too some out of a small, brown bottle and sprinkled it in. Phoenix: Couldn't she have been adding sugar? Kudo: Sugar!? In a small, brown bottle like that!? Judge: \"Like that\"? Witness, could you please describe the bottle in more concrete terms? Godot: Ha...! A bottle like this, perhaps? Kudo: Oh, there it is! That's the one! Judge: That's the bottle of potassium cyanide, I presume? Godot: So what did the accused put into the coffee? I think it's clear, don't you? Phoenix: Argh... Kudo: The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He took just one sip? Kudo: You young'uns! You waste everything! Those javaccinos cost 8 dollars! In the good old days, we would have drank every last drop, eaten the cup, and then died! Phoenix: (Congratulations. You have earned the title of Battiest Man To Grace A Courtroom.) Godot: So it was an immediate death? Well, with potassium cyanide, I suppose that is possible. Kudo: Oh, yes. He slumped over without so much as a twitch! I felt the javaccino I'd just drank turn sour in my stomach. Godot: Oh, yes. I know that feeling. Judge: And the waitress? I presume she is...? Kudo: That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by? Kudo: Particular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is! Phoenix: Sorry? Kudo: You can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform! Phoenix: Phoenix: So the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me! Judge: Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image. Maya: Don't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together! Phoenix: (I-I guess I got a bit carried away...) Kudo: Kah! There are other things I recognize about her, too. Phoenix: (He seems pretty sure of himself. What should I do?) Leave it Phoenix: (There's got to be a better line of attack than this. That's what I should be looking for now...) Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Sure, you saw a waitress take the coffee over to the victim. But what matters is whether that waitress was Maggey Byrde or not. Judge: Quite right. Mr. Kudo. These other \"features\" that you recognize about the defendant... I would ask you to add them to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Adds statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\" Press (after adding statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by? Kudo: Particular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is! Phoenix: Sorry? Kudo: You can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform! Phoenix: Phoenix: So the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me! Judge: Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image. Maya: Don't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together! Phoenix: (I-I guess I got a bit carried away...) Kudo: Kah! There are other things I recognize about her, too. Kudo: There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (There's no doubt he remembers the waitress pretty well. What should I do? I get the feeling there's something more to this somehow...) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I must be imagining it. I need to find another angle with this guy.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the straps Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. You seem especially interested in straps. Why is that? Kudo: Wh-What? Phoenix: The ribbon in her hair, the straps on her apron. What's the fascination? Kudo: F-Fascination? Godot: Godot: People have all kinds of fetishes, Trite. We don't need to embarrass the witness. Kudo: Listen, you young upstarts! I haven't got some sick strap fetish! Judge: Hmm... Is there any relevance to the witness's unusual love of straps, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I was just curious as to why he was so fixated on the waitress's straps... Kudo: I said I haven't got a strap fetish! How many times do I have to repeat myself!? Judge: Very well. Continue with your testimony, Mr. Kudo. And make it strapless. Kudo: *grumble grumble* Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the waitress's back Phoenix: The identifying \"features\" you described are all things you would see from the back. Kudo: So what? Phoenix: Is it possible that... ...you never saw the waitress from the front at all!? Godot: Godot: Ha...! He's got you there, gramps! Phoenix: People normally talk about facial features when they're asked to describe someone. But this witness's testimony is nothing but straps and ribbons! Kudo: Th-This is harassment! I tell you I'm not obsessed with straps or ribbons! I'm just telling you what I saw! Judge: Mr. Kudo, the court requests that you add details about any identifying features... Features you observed from the front, that is, to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Maya: The old man's testimony is getting longer and longer! Phoenix: And if I can't find a hole in it soon, it'll get even longer, I bet. Adds statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\" Press (after adding statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm... Kudo: There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't find anything to be distinct, but you did clearly see the witness's face, yes? Kudo: No question about it! I didn't come this far to back down now! Victor Kudo never backs down! Phoenix: (That's not the answer I was looking for, but OK...) Maya: This has turned into a matter of pride for Old Seedy now, I guess... I wonder if he really did see Maggey's face or not... Phoenix: (Like I thought, we need some concrete proof of this. Proof that the old guy didn't see the waitress clearly from the front.) Present Apron Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\" Maya: Do you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it? Phoenix: Well, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there. Maya: But he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress... Phoenix: I-I guess... (Hmm, she makes a good point though...) Maya: Hey! Did I just say something clever? Phoenix: I wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw really was Maggey... Maya: That's what we have to figure out, Nick! Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this. Kudo: Kah! That filthy thing would suit filth like you just perfectly. Actually, it reminds me of what my grandson looks like, just after he's done eating. Phoenix: Have you ever seen this before? Kudo: Of course I haven't! Do you think I'd forget something as dirty as that!? Hmm? Well? You half-witted clot!? Phoenix: ... Judge: ... ......... Kudo: Wh-What!? What is it!? Ever since I said, \"you half-witted clot\", there's been an eerie silence in here. Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. This apron... ...is the apron worn by the defendant on the day of the poisoning! Kudo: Uh? Phoenix: And as you just said yourself... ...you wouldn't forget something like this. Which means, is you had really seen this apron before... Kudo: Er... Phoenix: Yes, you know what I'm getting at! You couldn't have possibly seen the waitress from the front! Kudo: ... Oops! Judge: Witness! You can't just \"oops\" your way out of this! Godot: Ha...! Well, well... Looks like we finally have a genuine trial on our hands. Phoenix: ... Godot: Listen, Trite. Here are the facts. On the day of the incident, there was only one waitress in the restaurant. Judge: That being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde? Godot: Exactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching! Judge: Hmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing. Godot: Just tell the court exactly what you saw, gramps. Kudo: You can rely on me, Captain! My noggin's in perfect working order. I can't remember a single occasion when I forgot what burger a customer wanted! Maya: He can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out... Judge: Very well. Let's test just how good your memory and attention to detail is, Mr. Kudo. Tell us what you remember about the victim. Witness Testimony -- About the Victim -- Kudo: He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles. He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages! The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well. Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino. The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip. Judge: The testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail. Kudo: Oh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything! Maya: How are we going to handle this, Nick? Phoenix: We only need to do one thing. We just need to prove that the old man's memory is shot. Maya: Just trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel? Phoenix: (I suppose... But it's what I do best.) Cross Examination -- About the Victim -- Kudo: He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Spectacles? Kudo: Dark glasses to you! One of the lenses was green, but the other was broken. Newfangled rubbish! That's why I remember him so well. Phoenix: (He did have some kind of lens over his left eye... But I wouldn't have called it a pair of glasses.) Judge: Hmm... He seems to have been wearing some rather modern-looking shades. Perhaps I should take to wearing some, and rival Mr. Godot's sharp appearance. Maya: Ah! We better come up with something sharp, and quick! Phoenix: (Guess I'll wait and see if I should challenge him about the \"spectacles\"...) Kudo: He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The newspaper was a sports paper, was it? Kudo: That young hooligan! I nearly asked him, \"Can't you even read without fidgeting, hmm!?\" How was I supposed to be able to read the back page with all that rustling going on!? I needed to find out if Gusten Brawn retained his championship title! Phoenix: (It was his paper, not yours! If you wanted to know so bad, why didn't you buy your own!?) Kudo: What are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? How dare you judge me! Phoenix: Ow! Ooow! Maya: Gusten Brawn got beaten yesterday, by the way. Anyway... Kudo: The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The wireless? Kudo: The decadent young rascal! In my day, it was one or the other! Read the paper, or listen to the wireless! Phoenix: (...Oh boy.) Kudo: And using an earpiece! It's selfish, that's what it is! I was straining my ears, but I couldn't catch any of it. Phoenix: (Was he that desperate to listen to the radio...?) Kudo: What are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? 2 you feel sorry for me! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Kudo: Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean the waitress, who you only saw from behind, right? Kudo: You're one of those, are you? You never let anything go, isn't that right? Phoenix: ...Maybe. Kudo: What does it matter if I saw her from the front or from behind!? My eyes don't lie! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! (I better not push it until I've got some hard evidence.) Kudo: The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"His free hand\"? Kudo: Yes. Phoenix: Which hand was that? Kudo: Weren't you listening before, cloth-ears!? I said he was rustling the newspaper with his right hand, didn't I? If his free hand wasn't his right hand, then which hand was it, you moron! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Godot: Ha...! Perhaps the great Mr. Trite has three hands! Phoenix: (Yeesh! I was only asking! No need to gang up on me and treat me like a freak!) Present Coffee Cup Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony?\" Phoenix: (The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.) Maya: I guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh? Phoenix: (Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!) Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony? That this was a way of testing the credibility of your memory? Kudo: I know, I know! There's nothing wrong with my memory, I tell you! Nothing! If I got anything wrong, I'll eat these seeds and sing the pigeon song! Godot: Care to tell us where this is going, Trite? Phoenix: According to Mr. Kudo, the victim was holding the paper in his right hand... ...while drinking coffee with his free hand, which would make that his left. Kudo: Kah! What is this? Kindergarten? Phoenix: But I would like the court to please take a look at this. Judge: That's the cup victim used, correct? Phoenix: Yes, and on the rim, you'll notice the mark left by the victim's lips. Judge: Yes. There is a stain left by the coffee. Phoenix: If you consider where that stain is, you'll clearly see... ...that the victim was holding the cup in his right hand! Kudo: But how...? Phoenix: Well, Mr. Kudo. The court is waiting for your epic performance! You said you'd eat those seeds and sing the pigeon song! Kudo: Aaaargh! Judge: Mr. Kudo... I'm afraid this is simply not acceptable. I think the witness had better go back to the park where he came from. Kudo: WAAAAIT! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to you tell me I'm mad, you're wrong! I don't care about that dirty coffee cup! I know what I saw! Judge: Y-You still insist on your testimony? Kudo: That young brat was holding the cup in his left hand! Oh, yes. No question! I'm a good, law-abiding citizen, I am. It's that dead young hotbot and you, you spikey-haired yahoo, who are at fault! Phoenix: (Who, me!?) Judge: Th-Thank you, old man. We've heard quite enough from you already. Kudo: Don't call me \"old man\", old man! Been around for 68 years, I have. You can't ignore me! LISTEN TO WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAAAAY! Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but... Godot: Sure, why not hear a little more? Judge: M-Mr. Godot! Godot: But this is my 16th cup of coffee... So this is your final stand. Kudo: Thank you, Captain! You can rely on Victor! Witness Testimony -- Left Hand or Right Hand -- Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs. He kept fiddling with it all the time. He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too. And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand! Judge: We know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye. Godot: It wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers. Judge: A monitor? You mean, like a television screen!? Godot: The inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work. Kudo: HDTV, DVD, CD... All these newfangled letters drive me mad! But they don't matter. I know what I saw, and I'm telling the truth! Phoenix: (It's true... He doesn't seem to be lying.) Kudo: And those are the facts, in good old black and white! Cross Examination -- Left Hand or Right Hand -- Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the victim was wearing an HMD. Kudo: HDTV, CD, DVD... What does it matter!? Phoenix: (It was none of them actually, but anyway...) And you're sure that he was wearing the earpiece on the same side? Kudo: No question! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting. Phoenix: (Yeah. That's pretty obvious if you look at the floor plans. From the opposite table, he'd only have a view of the side of the victim's head.) Present Victim's Prescription Bag or Glen Elg profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but...\" Kudo: He kept fiddling with it all the time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: It seems you kept an eye on Mr. Glen Elg. Kudo: He was getting on my nerves! Rustling that newspaper and fiddling with his earpiece all the time! And then he went and made all that fuss dying from one sip of javaccino! I wanted to say to him, \"Calm down, you young brat!\" Just looking at him made me suddenly speed up my seed eating! I could've chocked! Phoenix: (So I take it the victim was a walking ball of nervous energy...) Kudo: He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The earpiece you mentioned... Which hand did the victim touch it with? Kudo: ... You're one of those people! One of those people who uses his left hand to get things out of his right pocket. Or fastens his left cuff with his right hand? And when the tour guide says, \"On your right side, you'll see the famous blah-blah\"... ...you're the only one who deliberately looks left! Well? Aren't you? Phoenix: N-No! I didn't mean... Kudo: Obviously he used the hand on the same side of his body that the earpiece was in! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Ow! (So, if he had the HMD on his left side, then it was his left hand, I guess...) Kudo: And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You seem very sure of yourself, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: That's because I know what I saw, no matter what tricks you try to play on me! Phoenix: (It looks like he really did see the guy picking the cup up with his left hand. This is a dead end!) Maya: Well, Nick? What do you think? Phoenix: I think the guy's telling the truth. But even so... Something's not quite right. Maya: Then chuck evidence at him until he breaks! Phoenix: (But if he's not lying, there wouldn't be any contradictions in his testimony, right?) Phoenix: I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but... Mr. Kudo! There is something very strange about your observations of the victim. Kudo: What!? Phoenix: You say he was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the HMD. Kudo: No question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting. Phoenix: I don't think so. Kudo: Wh-What did you say!? Phoenix: You're no doubt unaware of this fact, Mr. Kudo. But the victim couldn't hear with his left ear! His eardrum was ruptured! Kudo: Eh? Phoenix: Traces of medication for his condition were found in his ear canal. That's right! It's impossible that the victim was wearing his earpiece in his left ear. Because he couldn't even hear in that ear! Kudo: ... Is that true, Captain? Godot: ...It is. Kudo: ...Pi... Pi-Pi-Pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Pretty pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Judge: Order! Order! Order! Phoenix: This witness's testimony is completely unreliable! He only saw the witness from behind. And he claims the victim was wearing an earpiece when we know his eardrum was ruptured! Well, Mr. Godot!? Godot: Aaaargh! A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup! The old man... ...is my drop of milk! Kudo: Captain! Are you calling me a drip!? Judge: This is the victim's coffee cup in which the potassium cyanide was found. The mark on the rim clearly shows that the victim picked it up with his right hand! Kudo: I'll never back down! I know I'm right! The lad drank his javaccino with his left hand! Godot: Let me put you out of your misery... Clearly, the victim used both hands. He took a sip with the cup held in his right hand, and then switched to his left... That's what the old man saw! Phoenix: Phoenix: Impossible! The witness has already testified on numerous occasions... ...that the victim died immediately after taking just one sip of the coffee. Godot: Godot: Which hand the victim used to pick up his cup is irrelevant, Your Honor. The facts still stand! With one hand or the other, Mr. Elg drank the poisoned coffee... ...Like this! Phoenix: Phoenix: Sadly, Mr. Godot, that doesn't wash! The point of this testimony was to establish whether the witness's memory was credible. And the results are clear! The testimony given by this witness is useless! Godot: Puuuurgh! Judge: I believe it is time to conclude today's proceedings. I am satisfied that the witness is not deceiving the court. But to be frank, his testimony is a farce! Kudo: D-Did you have to be so frank!? Take that, you pompous old fogey! Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo. You can't reach me from there. I'm ordering the defense and the prosecution to investigate this case further. That is all for now. This court is adjourned! ???: Kudo: WAAAAIT! If we stop now, where does that leave me? Judge: Leave you, Mr. Kudo? Kudo: Thanks to that blue-suited young upstart over there... ...I'm just a bumbling old man who can't even dot his t's or cross his i's now! Phoenix: (How is your bad memory my fault!?) Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but there's nothing I can do. Kudo: I've kept my mouth shut until now... ...but there's something else the court should know! Godot: What!? Phoenix: There's more? Kudo: To be perfectly honest, it might not be anything. But I want another chance! I want another crack at you, you young shark! Phoenix: M-Me? (He's looking at me like I'm some sort of evil Shogun...) Kudo: Well, everyone? What do you say to one final showdown? The final chapter in this eccentric old man's scrapbook! Godot: Sorry, gramps... I've already had my 17th cup of coffee. Kudo: What have you got to lose, Captain? I'll give you all the javaccino you want if you come to my house after the trial. (Changed from [I'll give you all the coffee you want if you come to my house after the trial.] in the original release) I may be 68 years old, but Victor Kudo is still a man! Judge: That's enough, witness. I believe it will be quicker for the court to just hear your testimony. Kudo: You bet! Much, much quicker! Maya: I can't believe this is happening... Kudo: Ha ha ha! You better get ready, youngster! Phoenix: I get the picture! Just quit throwing those seeds at me, would you!? (He's gotta be using some sort of infinite ammo code with that box of seeds...) Witness Testimony -- The Final Showdown -- Kudo: First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself. The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino... Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over. It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked! Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm? Judge: ... Um... Is that all? Kudo: Yes, that's all. I remember it perfectly. Eh!? You're doubting me again? You're doubting a poor, defenseless old man!? Judge: N-No. We are not doubting you, Mr. Kudo. Maya: Don't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick? Phoenix: Yeah. \"So what?\" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy! Kudo: You're a birdbrain, that's why that's all you can think of! Judge: Very well... Mr. Wright. Your final cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- The Final Showdown -- Kudo: First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Um... The court generally prefers if witnesses are sure of themselves, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Noisy brat! I'm warning you, I'm more savage than a macho man right now! You won't beat me with this testimony! This is the final battle! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! (He's chucking those seeds harder than ever! I better be careful...) Maya: Come on, Nick! Nail him! Kudo: The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The court has already heard that testimony, Mr. Kudo... Kudo: I know that! I was just setting the mood. How else am I supposed to build up the suspense, hmm!? Phoenix: The suspense? Kudo: Isn't it enough? Should I work the audience a bit more? Judge: No, no! Please continue, Mr. Kudo. As quickly as possible! Kudo: Alright. Now where was I...? ...Ah yes. The young boy slumped over the table, and... Kudo: Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A vase, you say? Kudo: Yes. There are vases on all the tables in that place. They're accidents waiting to happen! They're practically begging to be knocked over! Phoenix: (Well, he's right about there being vases. I do remember seeing them, too... There was a vase on the table when I ate munch there.) And you saw the moment when the victim actually knocked over the vase? Kudo: Well... it's hard to say... It's a bit unclear... How do you really define... Phoenix: OK, I get it. Kudo: I heard it break! And the sight of it is burned into my memory as clear as day! Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\" Kudo: It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Soaked in water, you mean? Kudo: Yes. It splashed me on the knee as well. Phoenix: You said you were sitting at a table across the room from the victim, correct? And yet, the water still managed to splash onto you? Kudo: ... It was cold! I clearly remember it splashing me! Phoenix: (Could the water really make it all the way across to the other side of the room...?) Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\" Kudo: Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean, the vase on the victim's table falling upside-down and breaking? Kudo: The vase turned upside-down, and my testimony's turning this case upside-down... It's a joke! I just wanted everyone to hear it! What do you think, Captain!? Godot: ...I'm impressed. By your ability to waste time. Phoenix: (Godot hasn't raised any objections for a while now...) Kudo: So, you young show-off! With that scrap of information, I'm throwing down the gauntlet! If I lose this one, I'll take it like a man and admit defeat! Phoenix: He's really giving you the evil eye, Maya. Maya: It's you he's looking at, Nick, not me! It's like he's saying, \"I triple dog dare you to find a contradiction, young'un!\" Phoenix: I guess I'll just have to rise to the challenge then... Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene. Kudo: Hmph! So what? Phoenix: Look carefully at the table. The vase is there... intact! Kudo: Huh? Phoenix: Lost your tongue, granddad? Kudo: ... I'm no granddad of yours, hop scotch! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Judge: Enough! If you throw any more seeds in this courtroom, the cleaners will be here all night. Kudo: Aaaaaah! Judge: ... What is it now? Kudo: I just remembered something! Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Go on... Kudo: The broken vase... Ha ha! It was on my table! Phoenix: Wha...? Kudo: Ah, well... You see... It startled me when that young lad collapsed. So I stood up. That must've been when it fell over. The vase on my table, I mean. Judge: The vase on your table? Kudo: Ah ha ha! Yes, it was on my table! And that's how my groin came to be completely soaked. ......... Judge: *sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today. Kudo: Er, I'd like to ask a question now. Have I, er... Have I been any use at all? Judge: Perhaps that's something you should reflect on yourself, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Aaaargh! WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else... Judge: Bailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom! Kudo: WAAAIT! LISTEN TO MEEEEEE! Judge: Well! We seem to have been considerably sidetracked. And I am still not in a position to deliver a verdict. Phoenix: ...! Judge: The defendant has not been positively identified as the waitress in question. Additionally, there are two disparities in the testimony we have heard thus far. Phoenix: The mark on the coffee cup that the victim supposedly drank from with his left hand. And the earpiece which was inserted into his left ear, out of which he couldn't hear. Maya: Wow, Nick! You did it! Judge: I therefore require both the defense and the prosecution to further investigate the facts. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Godot: ... Judge: There is one more thing before I call today's session to an end. Phoenix: O-One more thing, Your Honor? Judge: The witness we just heard from... He is most insistent that his testimony should be of use. So he's summarized it accordingly into this statement. Phoenix: Um... OK... Judge: You may each have a copy of it, if you wish. Godot: Whatever. The prosecution doesn't need props like that. Maya: Godot's really mad, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. I would be, too. Judge: Very well. Here you are then, Mr. Wright. There are 3 copies. My own, yours, and Mr. Godot's. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Victor's Testimony added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (\"I'm sorry\"? This isn't a piece of testimony! More like a five year old's apology...) Maya: What the heck are we supposed to do with 3 copies...? Judge: That is all. This court is adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned! Recipe for Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 January 7, 12:52 PMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: So how do you think the trial went this morning? Phoenix: How do you think it went!? Maya: It got a bit crazy in there. I just wonder if that killed our chances. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess it did get out of hand. Mr. Kudo's testimony did nothing to help us. Plus, now we don't even know the identity of the waitress who laced the coffee. Maya: All we know is what old Mr. Kudo saw... The apron straps, and the ribbon. Phoenix: And that the victim was wearing an earpiece when his eardrum was ruptured. Maya: Talk about a terrifying case of contradictionitus. Phoenix: Time to play doctor and find ourselves a cure then, huh? Maya: Yeah, we've gotta find one for Maggey, or she's going to have a terminal case of guilty! Talk What to do Phoenix: Well? I'm officially at a loss as to where to start. Maya: Yeah, me too. Let's try some brainstorming. You go first. Phoenix: I guess we should try to put Mr. Kudo's testimony to some sort of use. Maya: Yeah, that's true. Phoenix: And we need to figure out the identity of the waitress and who the victim really was... Somehow, I think the key to this case has got to be at Trés Bien. Maya: Well then, let's go back there and check it out again. Oh! And we should drop in on Maggey and see how she's doing, too. Any ideas Phoenix: So... Anything on your mind? Maya: Actually, there is something... Phoenix: ...? Maya: I was wondering about Xin Eohp... You know, like what he's like and stuff. Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I almost forgot about that guy. ???: I atta beat you so hard, it'll feel like youse were smoochin' the express train! ???: Phoenix Wright? Youse sayin' YOU' Phoenix Wright? ???: Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only! Phoenix: Actually... I've learned a little something about my doppelganger. Maya: Huh? You did? What did you find out? Phoenix: (Oh, yeah, Maya was working at the restaurant when I ran into Don Foneeonay...) Let's just say he was such a terrible version of me that I wanted to sue for defamation! (What's that guy's story, anyway? What does he have to gain by impersonating me?) Present Attorney's Badge Maya: That badge is totally useless, Nick. Phoenix: Huh!? Maya: I mean, no one suspected that Xin Eohp wasn't a real lawyer. I bet he didn't have an attorney's badge! Phoenix: ...I guess you're right. Maya: Or maybe he did have one! And maybe he switched your real one for a \"fugazzi\"! Phoenix: My badge? A fake!? ... Ha ha ha... That's a good one, Maya... Maya: Why the nervous laughter? ...Aha! I knew it! Your badge really IS fake, isn't it Nick? Sports Paper Maya: This doodle here... It was drawn by the victim, right? Phoenix: This is a newspaper from the day of the incident, so, yeah, we've got to assume so. There must be a clue in there somewhere. Maya: I guess we should show it around and see if anyone can tell us more about it. Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe there's a fake Nick running around. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. What's the deal with that? Why's he impersonating me? Maya: Maybe he's got something against you. People do tend to have a distinct distaste for you, Nick. Phoenix: (True enough... The only thing prosecutors seem to like about me is pushing me around...) Maya: Or... maybe he's got something against Maggey. Phoenix: (So he pretended to be me to get Maggey convicted?) Scooter Maya: That thing must've been in an accident. It's a total wreck! Phoenix: That's what the guy I met at the park was riding. And I'm betting he's the fake me. ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only! Phoenix: His voice is still ringing in my ears. Maya: Introduce me next time, Nick! I want to meet Xin Eohp, too! Jean's Loan Contract Maya: A loan of half a million dollars! I wonder what Mr. Armstrong did to get into that much debt. Phoenix: I'm going to guess he spent money needlessly. You'd better watch your spending, too. Maya: Hey, I've got a great idea! What if Mr. Armstrong charged $20,000 for the Twin-T set? Phoenix: If you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back! Victor's Testimony Maya: A letter of apology from the old man? Aww, how sweet. Phoenix: Actually, it's his \"testimony\"... If you can call it that. Maya: So? What's it say? ...\"I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry.\"? Heh heh! I used to break things all the time when I was little, you know. And I used to have to write apologies all the time, too. Phoenix: (Well, Pearls and Adrian seem to have picked up where you left off...) Coffee Cup Maya: That's the cup the poison was in, isn't it? Phoenix: Yeah, and the stain on the rim shows that the victim used his right hand to pick it up. Maya: But the old man swore he saw the victim pick it up with his left hand... Phoenix: (If Mr. Kudo wasn't mistaken, then what could account for this contradiction...?) Victim's Lottery Ticket Maya: Maybe I should try the lottery sometime, too. Phoenix: Sure, why not? If you hit the jackpot, you could win half a million bucks. Maya: So, what are you waiting for, Nick? Buy one! Phoenix: No way! Don't you know the lottery is a tax on people who are bad at math! Maya: Blah. Fine then. At least I can add it to the newly renamed \"Paths to Wealth\"! I'll have to call Pearly later and have her add, \"Buy lottery tickets whenever possible.\" Apron Maya: It's almost surreal that this artsy apron is what got us this far. Phoenix: Well, as art goes, this piece definitely leaves an impression. Maya: I guess that means the old guy never saw the front of it, huh? Which means he didn't see the waitress's face, either... Potassium Cyanide Maya: I can't believe they found this in Maggey's pocket. Phoenix: Yeah, but she was passed out, right? So the killer could've easily planted it on her. Maya: Where do you even get a hold of something like this? It's not like you can go down to your local CostMo' and buy it in bulk for $5 a pound! Phoenix: (She has got a point... How the killer got a hold of this poison is pretty important.) Victim's Prescription Bag Maya: \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\". Hmm... I guess if your eardrum was ruptured, you couldn't listen to the radio, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. It'd be pretty pointless to wear an earpiece of any kind. Maya: The medication in the bag is missing too, right? Phoenix: (The mysterious vanishing medication... Much like our mysterious \"other person\"...) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since then. I think Mia said it's because Maya's \"at a loss these days\"...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia really bailed me out again yesterday. Maya: Argh! That seedy old man was so rude to me! He didn't realize just how awesome I am. If he had, I bet he would've treated me better. Phoenix: Since when did you become so awesome? Godot profile Maya: Godot got it good today, huh? He was even smoking at me end there! Phoenix: He'll have a new witness ready for tomorrow, though. You can count on it. (We need to figure out the facts before then, or we're doomed!) Maggey Byrde profile Maya: A lot of strange conflicting things kept popping up today in the trial, huh? Phoenix: Yeah, and they seemed to come out of nowhere. Maya: That's why we've gotta go talk with Maggey and get out this whole thing straightened out! Phoenix: (Maggey said that when she brought the victim his coffee... ...there was one more people sitting at the table. This single contradiction is probably the most important one we have to resolve...) Glen Elg profile Maya: Have you noticed the victims in our cases tend to be people we know nothing about, Nick? Take Glen Elg, for example. Phoenix: Now that you mention it... Maya: We don't know what kind of guy he was, or why he was killed. I say it's time to get out there and find some answers! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: I really felt sorry for Gumshoe today. He really wanted to help Maggey out, but he kept getting backed into a corner. Phoenix: Maggey took it pretty bad, didn't she? Do you think she feels betrayed? Maya: Maybe. We've got to cheer her up somehow. She's a friend, after all. Phoenix: (A friend? Hmm... Never really thought of it that way, but I guess she is.) Victor Kudo profile Maya: It's the seedy old man! What's his name again? Phoenix: Vermin Kudo, is it? I can't remember, either. I've never seen a witness mess up so badly in court before. Maya: Better stay away from him a while, huh? Phoenix: (Yeah. It might be more than seed that he chucks at me next time.) Jean Armstrong profile Maya: The chef's a witness too, right? Phoenix: I suppose so. He was in the kitchen at the time of the incident. Maya: Well, since Old Man Seeds's testimony is pretty much useless to us... ...I guess we should speak to Mr. Armstrong again, huh? January 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: Looks like Gumshoe's not here. Phoenix: Never mind that. What's going on? It feels different in here somehow... Maya: You think? Phoenix: Yeah. Everyone seems to be on edge. Detective: What are you doing!? Call in the officers for the briefing, quick! Can't you shut down the station's server? Chief! Quit playing on the Internet! Chief: But my e-mail pen pal, 1337aZnPrInceSz! Detective: Save it for later! I'm turning it off NOW! Chief: Noooo! 1337aZnPrInceeeeeSz!! Maya: Everyone's keeping busy in here, huh? Phoenix: Keeping busy? More like panicking, if you ask me. (Something's going on. Something big...) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Even pickpockets can have their pockets picked.\" That's a keeper! Better to go with something that doesn't sound too much like a slogan. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a crime prevention campaign... ...But I'm not sure even he knows what kind of crime he's trying to prevent. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut. Chief: Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to write her a real letter instead of an email. Phoenix: (Alternately, you could write up some reports... Just a suggestion.) Chief: \"Dear 1337aZnPrInceSz, How are you? I'm OK! How was the show last night...?\" Maya: Wow, what an awesome job! Maybe I should send in my resume and become chief! Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\"! Right, Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Um... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: I guess Maggey's still in questioning. Maya: But! But we've got questions to ask her, too! Magg-ey! Magg-ey! Phoenix: Keep it down, Maya! This isn't a playground, you know! January 7Trés Bien Maya: Empty, as usual. Phoenix: Yeah, and it's lunchtime, too. ???: That's it! Come on, come on, come on! Phoenix: Hey, that sounds like... Gumshoe: Now just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can! Maya: He's getting really worked up about something. Gumshoe: Noooooo! That's the wrong number! Argh! Look like an \"8\" would have only netted me five bucks anyway! What a rip off! Maya: What's the problem, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Huh!? Oh, it's you... I, uh... I was uh... Hah hah! I was just... Hah hah hah! I was just listening to the radio, pal. Phoenix: To the radio? Maya: Hey, Detective Gumshoe's having lunch here! Phoenix: (He is! And he's having the Twin-T set...) Gumshoe: Aha ha ha... What can I say...? Examine Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Maya: It could say \"Entrance\" or \"Exit\", too. Did you think of that? Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: Hey, Nick. Do you think Old Seedy was talking about a vase like this today in court? Phoenix: It does look like it's ready to fall over any second. Looks kind of fragile, too. Maya: I bet if Mr. Armstrong charged 10,000 dollars for every vase a customer broke... ...he'd be able to pay off his loan really quickly. Phoenix: If you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got ya! I was just kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Maya: Wow, you really can't see the table in front or behind you at all! It's the perfect setup for slipping poison into your enemy's coffee. Talk Today's trial Gumshoe: This is a nightmare! How am I supposed to look Maggey in the eye now, pal!? Maya: You really drove her into a corner, you know. Gumshoe: You always blow apart my testimony! Why, of all days, didn't you do it today!? Phoenix: S-Sorry... There just weren't any holes in it... for once! Maya: Yeah, what happened? Usually, your testimonies are like Swiss cheese! Gumshoe: S-Swiss cheese...? Phoenix: (Would he have preferred, \"crumbly like aged parmesan\"? Anyway, this case has already been ruled on. There shouldn't be any holes left to find.) Gumshoe: So... Did Maggey say anything to you? About me, I mean. Maya: Well, um... How did she put it again...? Byrde: I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again! Maya: Something like that. Gumshoe: Wah... Waaaaaaaaaah! Maya: P-Please! Detective Gumshoe! I didn't mean... Gumshoe: Why!? Why is this happening!? Maya: He's banging his head against the wall, Nick! Phoenix: (Oh, man... Poor Gumshoe...) Lunch special Phoenix: So, did you like the Twin-T set? Gumshoe: I've never paid that much money for lunch before. I was so nervous, my hands were shaking. Maya: So? How did it taste!? Gumshoe: Well... For 20 bucks, I guess... I dunno how to describe it, really. It was... delicate. Maya: Delicate? Phoenix: You mean you liked it!? It didn't taste bad to you? Gumshoe: ... Maya: What's the matter with him? Phoenix: Looks like he's thinking... Gumshoe: ... That's it! I've been trying to think of the right word to describe the taste. I just got it right now... \"Bad\"! That's it. It tasted bad! Phoenix: *sigh* Gumshoe: It's kinda hard to admit it to yourself when you pay 20 bucks though, pal. Phoenix: (Maybe he should've found out about the price AFTER he had finished eating...) Maya: Maybe that's why Glen Elg came here. Maybe he heard about the famous Twin-T set! Phoenix: (Glen Elg, the victim, huh... Which reminds me. We still hardly know anything about the guy.) Maya: Why don't we ask Gumshoe what he knows, seeing as he's here? The radio Maya: So what were you all excited about earlier? Gumshoe: Huh? Phoenix: That's right! You said you were listening to the radio or something. Gumshoe: Oh, that? That was nothing! I-I wasn't excited! Maya: Come on, Detective Gumshoe! You can tell little ol' me! What were you listening to? Gumshoe: N-Nothing, really. It was just the, um... \"Daily Exercise Show\"! 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (What the...!? A Psyche-Lock?) Gumshoe: Hah hah hah! Mmm... This lunch special's lobster is great! Maya: Then why are there tears in your eyes...? The radio (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Lock) Maya: Come on, Detective Gumshoe. You can tell us what you were listening to on the radio. Gumshoe: But I already told you. It was the, um... the... weather forecast, pal. Phoenix: (Didn't you say it was an exercise program earlier!?) 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Gumshoe: It was nothing, really. Hah hah hah! Phoenix: (Even if it's nothing, the fact that he's hiding it makes me really curious!) The radio (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Gumshoe: I'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try. Phoenix: What's with everyone and the lottery...? Maya: So? How did it go? Gumshoe: I won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad! Phoenix: (Yeah, I know the feeling.) Gumshoe: I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg, see. (Changed from [I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg.] in the original release) And they've got this special radio show where they announce the winning numbers. (Changed from [When they read those results out on the radio, it really gets your heart pumping!] in the original release) They even do the drawings live on the air! It's intense, pal! (Changed from [You know they broadcast it live when they're picking the numbers? It's intense, pal!] in the original release) Maya: I bet that's what Mr. Elg was listening to on the day he was killed. (Changed from [I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.] in the original release) Phoenix: Yeah. What time is it now? Gumshoe: Uh, it's... It's just after 1:30. Phoenix: And are the lottery results always broadcast at the same time? Gumshoe: Yeah. Look, I got this flyer when I bought the ticket. Millionaire Radio Flyer added to the Court Record. Maya: \"Millionaire Radio\"? That sounds cool! I want to try it, Nick! Phoenix: Then buy a ticket, Maya. With your own money! The radio (subsequent times) Gumshoe: I'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try. Phoenix: What's with everyone and the lottery...? Maya: So? How did it go? Gumshoe: I won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad! Phoenix: (Yeah, I know the feeling.) Gumshoe: I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg, see. (Changed from [I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg.] in the original release) And they've got this special radio show where they announce the winning numbers. (Changed from [When they read those results out on the radio, it really gets your heart pumping!] in the original release) They even do the drawings live on the air! It's intense, pal! (Changed from [You know they broadcast it live when they're picking the numbers? It's intense, pal!] in the original release) Maya: I bet that's what Mr. Elg was listening to on the day he was killed. (Changed from [I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.] in the original release) I want to try it, Nick! Phoenix: Then buy a ticket, Maya. With your own money! Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? Gumshoe: It tells me the guy is cruising for a bruising! Maya: You're really caring, aren't you, Detective Gumshoe? About Maggey, I mean. Magatama (after clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, before breaking Psyche-Lock) Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- The Radio -- Phoenix: Alright, Detective Gumshoe, tell me the truth. What were you listening to? Gumshoe: No way, pal. Now that you've made a big thing out of it, I'm not gonna tell you... Phoenix: We'll see about that, pal. Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening... ...it's pretty clear what kind of radio program it was. I'd say it was related to... Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm right, aren't I?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Detective Gumshoe!? Gumshoe: Yeah! That's it, pal! You got me. You sure are something! Phoenix: (Then how come I'm still seeing the lock? Guess I was wrong... Now, what was it he shouting when he was listening to the radio...?) Gumshoe: That's it! Come on, come on, come on! Gumshoe: Now just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can! Gumshoe: Noooooo! That's the wrong number! Phoenix: (It seems so obvious... I'd better ask him again.) Gumshoe: D-Don't tell me you're not through yet... Leads back to: \"Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening...\" Phoenix: I'm right, aren't I? You were listening to the lottery results, weren't you? You thought you'd try to win big, just like Glen Elg did! Gumshoe: I-It's... It's like you can see right through me! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (Huh? I've cracked him already...?) Gumshoe: That's why I said it was nothing! Unlock Successful Sports Paper Gumshoe: That's the sports paper the victim wrote something in, right? ... Maya: What is it? Gumshoe: I know I've heard that name somewhere before... \"MC Bomber\"... Yeah... I heard it real recently, too... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Lunch Special Gumshoe: I haven't got anything to say about that, pal. ... Just take it away already, please? Phoenix: (Spending 20 dollars on this has got to be killing him inside...) Scooter Gumshoe: Hey! Are you putting this up for sale, pal? Phoenix: N-No! Why, would you want a busted up scooter like this anyway? Maya: Yeah. Plus, the seat's all covered in pigeon poop! Gumshoe: Who cares? If it runs, that's all that matters to me. Phoenix: (My phony was riding this bike... Maybe if I head back to the park. it'll be there again.) Victim's Lottery Ticket Gumshoe: A one-way ticket to happiness, huh? Phoenix: Glen Elg died because of this ticket. Gumshoe: Yeah, but it's still a one-way ticket to happiness, pal. Phoenix: And Maggey was found guilty of murder because of it, too. Gumshoe: ... Maya: ...Looks like anything about Maggey is an instant conversation stopper. Phoenix: Yeah. He's got a real soft spot for her, and it obviously hurts when you hit it! Apron Gumshoe: That's the apron Maggey was wearing. Yeah, it still smells like her, too. Maya: Does this mean Maggey smells like ketchup? Victim's Prescription Bag Gumshoe: We never did find the contents of that bag. Maya: It was medicine for Mr. Elg's ruptured eardrum, right? Gumshoe: Yeah. We found traces of it in his left ear canal. He must've used it while he was at Trés Bien. We're sure of that much. Millionaire Radio Flyer Gumshoe: Apparently everyone's listening to this show now. Maya: That's because everyone wants money. Gumshoe: They say that the victim, Glen Elg, was really into gambling. Maya: Yep. You can't beat gambling! I love it, too! I won 500 dollars last night playing cards with Nick. Phoenix: Huh? We were playing for money!? Maya: Of course! So you'd better pay up! Gumshoe: You're a smart one! ...Waiting for a cop to be present before asking for the cash! Godot profile Gumshoe: Mr. Godot agreed to take this case just so he could face you, pal. He was working on a bunch of more important cases, but he cancelled them all... Maya: Huh? But then... ...why didn't Mr. Godot take this case... ...when Maggey's first trial came up? Phoenix: Yeah. that is kinda odd. I mean, everyone thought the defense was \"Phoenix Wright\". So why didn't he try to fight \"me\" then? Gumshoe: Well, according to Mr. Godot... ...he knew the guy was a phony right away, so he didn't want to bother with the trial. Phoenix: (He couldn't be bothered to tell the judge!?) Maggey Byrde profile Gumshoe: Maggey's probably crying all alone right now, huh... Maya: Yeah, thanks to you. Gumshoe: Aaaaaaargh! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! Phoenix: Maya! Don't torch poor Gumshoe feelings like they're are some sort of cheap crème brûlée! Maya: You're really crazy about Maggey, aren't you? Gumshoe: No! No, no! I'm just... I'm not... It's not that I... Phoenix: (You don't have to hide it, Gumshoe! It's pretty obvious.) Maya: Yeah, you're way too plain-looking for Maggey. Right? Gumshoe: I'd arrest you right now if you weren't so right... Glen Elg profile Gumshoe: This guy was a real programming genius. They called him \"the walking computer\" at the place where he worked. Maya: What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!? Phoenix: (*groan* He wasn't LITERALLY a computer, Maya!) (Changed from [*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!] in the original release) Gumshoe: Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim. Phoenix: Yeah. That's what we found out yesterday, too. Maya: Hey, Detective Gumshoe. Don't you have any information that's a bit more fun? Gumshoe: F-Fun? I, uh... Oh! I know! So, have you paid a visit to where Elg worked yet? You might as well. Maya: His workplace? Where's that? Gumshoe: A computer firm called \"Blue Screens, Inc.\" or something like that. Maya: Sounds like a real stable company. This could be fun, Nick. Let's go! Phoenix: Computers aren't really my thing, Maya. Maya: We'll be fine! I know all about that hi-tech stuff. Phoenix: (I wonder about that...) Gumshoe: It's just around the corner from this joint. You should take a look. Phoenix: (A computer firm called \"Blue Screens, Inc.\" huh...) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I know I look a little rough around the edges. But the truth is, I'm a lot more \"detective-like\" than I used to be. Maya: Really? Like what part? Gumshoe: ...Like the color of my coat. Maya: Ah! You're right! Phoenix: (Yeah, but what about what's inside the coat...?) Victor Kudo profile Gumshoe: You know, in all my years, I've never seen a witness who was that confused before. Phoenix: Yeah, you looked pretty confused by his testimony. Gumshoe: Nothing against old guys, I like them and all... But... He sounded like he was pretty sure about what he saw. Maya: Yeah, that's the impression I got, too! Phoenix: (Me, three... But then, why doesn't even a single part of his testimony corroborate any of the facts?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh lá lá! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Maya: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". But I'll tell you want. This stuff works like a charm. I slept like a rock last night. Phoenix: O-Oh, really... That's nice... Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal... I can't discuss anything connected to the case. Maya: Hey! I thought you said you were going to help us out! Gumshoe: I can't help you out if I don't have any info! Phoenix: Yeah, I suppose the retrial has only just begun... January 7Vitamin Square Maya: Hmm... I don't see any sign of Mr. Kudo. Do you? Phoenix: Maybe he went to buy another ton of bird seeds. I was kind of hoping he wouldn't be here, anyway. At least, not for now. (Besides, any more seeds today and I'm liable to turn into a real phoenix!) Examine Scooter Maya: Hey, check this out... Phoenix: I wouldn't get too close to that if I were you. Otherwise you might be in for a shock. My phony must be lurking someplace nearby... Just imagine! A Tiger, loose in the city! Maya: Meanwhile the real Phoenix is like an abandoned chick, lost in a vast urban jungle! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Don't worry. Someday, you'll grow up and become a ferocious tiger, too! Don't lose hope! Phoenix: (Why is she trying to pep-talk me into becoming my phony...?) Orange Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: Speaking of fun, if we get Maggey acquitted, may be can all get together sometime. Maya: OK! ...But what do we play with someone who's never even won a game of Tic-Tac-Toe? Phoenix: How about we change the rules a bit, then? We could play Old Maid, and... um... We could say the person who's left with the old maid at the end is the winner. How's that? Maya: Not bad... Not bad at all! We could even rename the game to \"Fair Maiden\"! January 7Trés BienKitchen Maya: Huh? Mr. Armstrong's talking to someone. ???: I'll be back next month. Armstrong: Oui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you! ???: If you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here. Armstrong: Non! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise! ???: I love fire, you know... I love the way it crackles... Hee... Hee... Hee... Armstrong: Non, non, non! Stop it! I beg you! ???: Then don't let me down... I'll be watching you... Armstrong: Mais, non! Z'is is not necessary! You can trust me, mademoiselle! ???: Talk to anyone... and I'll drive a knife... right through your heart. Armstrong: Oh, non! You do not 'ave to worry. You know, you worry far too much. Maybe z'is will 'elp you relax. It is la oil of sandalwood. ???: I do love... raw meat... from time to time... Hee... Hee... Hee... Armstrong: Aaaaah! ???: I'll be taking my leave... Goodbye... for now! Armstrong: Urgh! I 'ave la shivers! I must rub some of my oil all over my body before I become z'e nervous wreck! Z'ere. Oh, oui, oui! Z'at feels good! Phoenix: Urgh! Armstrong: Oh là là! Excusez-moi, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My eyes! My EYES! Armstrong: Your eyes? If you 'ave trouble wi'z your eyes, you need z'is. La oil of sandalwood! Phoenix: Isn't this just the leftovers of what you were just using!? Examine Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I ate yesterday for lunch? Maya: Yeah, I think it's been permanently burned into my brain now... ...as an example of what truly awful food tastes like. Phoenix: (I bet it'd taste really good if it was prepared well. ...Balsamy even!) Talk Trés Bien Phoenix: You don't exactly have many customers, do you, Mr. Armstrong? Armstrong: Non, you are right, monsieur. But per'aps z'at is la perfect time for you to visit me, non? Now I can give you my undivided attention, and cook for you la dish suprême! Phoenix: Putting on a brave face, huh? Maya: That's what girls do, Nick! Armstrong: But you are right. Business is very difficult z'ese days. Per'aps ze name is la problem. People do not understand it. Z'ey think it is \"tray\". I just wanted people to think z'at my restaurant was exclusive. Phoenix: But they think you just serve fast food on cheap, plastic trays? Maya: Nick! That's the kind of thing that can make a girl cry! Phoenix: Have you forgotten that Mr. Armstrong is a man, Maya? Armstrong: But z'is restaurant is my life! It is everything to me! I will defend it to la finale! No one will take it from me! The woman just now Phoenix: So who was that woman you were just talking to? Armstrong: Oh lá lá! You saw z'at? Phoenix: Ah, well... Yes. Sorry. Maya: So? Who was she!? She looked so polite and graceful. Armstrong: P-Polite!? G-Graceful!? Maya: And she likes raw meat and fires, right? ???: I'll be back next month. Armstrong: Oui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you! ???: If you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here. Armstrong: Non! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise! Phoenix: (Now that I think about it...) Hey, Maya... I think it's pretty clear what kind of conversation they were having. Maya: You think so? Well, then let's show him that piece of evidence and see what happens! The woman just now (appears after presenting Jean's Loan Contract) Phoenix: The woman who was here earlier... I take it that she's... um... Armstrong: Why 'as it come to z'is...? What a tragedy! Suddenly I find myself so deep in la debt. It is a sign of la bad, bad world we live in, uh? Phoenix: (No. I'd say it's more of a sign of la bad, bad culinary skills...) Armstrong: Z'e woman who was 'ere... Z'e scary woman... She is from la loan office. Phoenix: Loan office? Is that where you borrowed half a million dollars from? Armstrong: Oui. Tender Lender, it is called. Maya: Catchy name. Just hearing it makes me wanna borrow some money. Armstrong: Please! You must not borrow from z'em. If you must, no more z'an ten dollars! Phoenix: Ten dollars? Sounds like your whole monthly stipend, Maya... Maya: Hey! I get a bit more than that, thank you very much! Phoenix: So Tender Lender is the loan office you borrowed half a million from, huh? Maya: I wonder if they've got anything to do with this case... Tender Lender (appears after \"The woman just now\") Armstrong: I am a weak woman. When I am upset, I 'ave to buy something nice to cheer me up. Thanks to 'im loaning me la money, I 'ave to pay back 'alf a million dollars now! I am like 'is slave. I 'ave to do everything z'at 'e tells me. Maya: Um... Who's this he? Armstrong: La Tiger... Maya: The Tiger? Armstrong: Oui. 'E is la manager of z'e Tender Lender. A terrifying man! La big city mobster! When 'e shouts at me, my knees are trembling and 'is voice is ringing in my ears for 3 days! As soon as I 'ear la noise of z'at battered old scooter 'e rides, I start to cry! Phoenix: (A big city mobster who rides a battered old scooter...?) Um, does this guy resemble me by any chance? Armstrong: Oh, non, non, non! Z'is man 'as a presence! A most formidable personality! Although... Oui, 'e does 'ave la spikey 'air just like you. Oui, z'ere is a resemblance z'ere, I suppose. Phoenix: (Hmm... Sounds like this loan office is worth checking out after all...) Armstrong: If you want to visit z'e Tender Lender, it is just beyond Vitamin Square. Maya: Hey, Nick... If you need money, I can loan you some... As long as it's less than 3 dollars... Phoenix: Um... Thanks for the offer... (...Just beyond Vitamin Square, huh?) Present Magatama Armstrong: Oh, what a beautiful pendant! It would look stunning on me w'iz la earrings! Maya: Please don't steal it again, OK? It's one of a kind! Armstrong: I could just 'ave a sliver of it, non? Maya: I-It's not a block of cheese, you know! Sports Paper Phoenix: This is the paper the victim brought with him. Armstrong: \"MC Bomber\"...? Oui... Maya: Does that mean something to you? Armstrong: Non, I only speak French, mademoiselle. Maya: But we found it behind your magazine rack... Armstrong: Oh, 'ow naughty I am! I 'aven't cleaned for such a long time! Lunch Special Armstrong: Oh là là! So you 'ave eaten my lunch, oui? Tell me, monsieur. Did you enjoy la lunch I prepared for you? Phoenix: It was a... unique and... wild mixture of flavors. Maya: That was the first time I ever had lobster, you know! Armstrong: Lobster? Z'ere was no lobster in my lunch... Maya: Huh? But, it said, \"lobster\" right on the menu. Armstrong: Mademoiselle Maya. Please, you must read la menu more carefully. It says, \"A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with a balsamic vinaigrette. Maya: Oh. It's \"inspired\", is it? Armstrong: Oui. \"Inspired\" by z'ese ingredients, but not per'aps made from z'em, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Well, guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, Nick. Phoenix: (The way the lunch tasted, it's probably 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.) Scooter Armstrong: ... Maya: What is it? Armstrong: Is z'is your scooter? Phoenix: No, no! I saw it before in Vitamin Square, you see... Armstrong: Mon dieu! Non, non, non! Take it away! Do not show z'at to me! Phoenix: (Talk about an allergic reaction...) Jean's Loan Contract Armstrong: So long as z'at paper exists, I am but a delightful angel w'iz la broken wings! Maya: An angel, huh...? Doesn't bode well, when you think about it... Armstrong: Oui! Z'ey kept 'arassing me month after month. In z'e end, I 'ad to give in. I agreed to 'elp z'em. Maya: Help them? With what? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr, if I did not owe z'em la money, I would 'ave refused. But my 'ands were tied! Phoenix: Please! What did you agree to help them with? Armstrong: Non. I-I cannot say! If I tell you, z'at woman, she will slice me up... ...and eat me w'iz la salad garnish! Phoenix: (Eww! I hope he doesn't mean that he'll literally be sliced up and served with garnish...) I'm going to guess that woman has something to do with your loan contract. Am I right? Armstrong: Ah! Maya: Please, Mr. Armstrong, tell us about that woman! Victor's Testimony Armstrong: Ah, it is true. My vases are broken all z'e time. I bought a new one z'e next day after la incident. But z'ey wouldn't let me put it on la table because of la investigation. Victim's Lottery Ticket Armstrong: If only I 'ad taken z'e right lottery ticket... I would not 'ave any debts right now. I would be free! Maya: Look on the right side, Mr. Armstrong. You won a dollar, right? Phoenix: (A lack of remorse for having stolen something: Priceless.) Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: You 'ave la perfect face for a waitress, you know. Maya: Um, thanks. I guess if things don't work out someday, then maybe I'll be back. Phoenix: (What things? Is she talking about her being a spirit medium...?) Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Oh, 'ow it 'urts me to see z'at poor girl's face! Phoenix: Maggey's? Armstrong: I 'eard she was super'umanly un'appy. Maya: Superhumanly...? Armstrong: And if she 'adn't come to work for me, she wouldn't 'ave got into z'is mess. Phoenix: (Huh? I'm missing something here, aren't I?) Armstrong: Je suis désolé, Maggey! Forgive me! After presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien: January 7Blue Screens, Inc. Maya: Wow! This place is so hi-tech! You can almost smell the electricity in the air! Phoenix: It is a computer firm, Maya. They can't work without electricity, you know. ???: Who are you? Maya: Oh, umm... Hello... ???: I'm sorry. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only. This is a computer programming laboratory. There are far too many trade secrets that could be leaked. Maya: Wow! What secrets!? ???: Everything you see here is classified. No information can leave this building. Maya: Understood! Phoenix: (Who is this woman? She's like a robot from some kind of whacked edumacational show...) Basil: My name is Lisa Basil. I'm the company director. Phoenix: D-Director!? (Sh-She's human!? She seems more like a ghost in a shell. And that thing over her eye... Isn't that the same device as Glen Elg's?) Maya: That's an [sic] DMH, right? Phoenix: Nice try, but it's the other way around, Maya. It's an HMD. Basil: All of my programmers here at Blue Screens, Inc. are supplied with HMDs. Maya: Then do you write programs, too? Basil: No. I just enjoy wearing this. Maya: They ARE pretty cool! I wouldn't mind one! Examine Pillars Phoenix: Those pillars almost look like they're moving. It's kind of unsettling. Maya: Nah, they just look a bit twisted or warped or whatever word I'm looking for... Basil: This office was designed with a futuristic feel in mind. Maya: Futuristic? Basil: Yes. We tried to imagine what things might look like in the future when we designed it. It helps to soothe and calm the soul. Maya: ... On second thought, I agree with you, Nick. This place is really unsettling. Super computer Maya: Hey, look Nick! It's a super-computer! It looks like it's really smart and wise, doesn't it? Phoenix: Computers are only as smart as the humans who use them, Maya. Maya: That explains why we don't use the computer in our office! Phoenix: You work there too, Maya. Maya: Yeah, but at least I'm... Basil: Please. Don't argue about something that's so trivial. Otherwise the computer will laugh at you. Maya: She said she'd laugh at us, Nick. Phoenix: (She's a human, Maya, not a computer!) Programmers Phoenix: He's really pounding that keyboard, isn't he? Maya: Wow! I bet that's where the \"pro\" in \"programmer\" comes from, huh? I guess I shouldn't be resting on my laurels. Gotta expand my skill set and all that. Phoenix: Yeah, that's a good idea. Maya: Maybe I could become Old Seedy's apprentice. Phoenix: (Um... And what about your spirit medium training?) Tickets on floor Maya: Wow! Look at this mess! Phoenix: Looks like they're all betting tickets. Maya: What kind of betting tickets? Phoenix: For betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets. Maya: Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these... Phoenix: (Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.) Glen Elg's Losing Horse Racing Tickets gathered up. Maya: This many tickets would get you... what? A buck down at the recycling center? But I didn't know you were so hard up that you'd try to profit from the dead, Nick. (Changed from [You're hopeless, Nick. You know that?] in the original release) Phoenix: (I'm just taking them as evidence, Maya!) Tickets on floor (subsequent times) Maya: Wow! Look at this mess! Phoenix: Looks like they're all betting tickets. Maya: What kind of betting tickets? Phoenix: For betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets. Maya: Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these... Phoenix: (Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.) Horse calendar Maya: Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess! Phoenix: Looks pretty average to me. Maya: But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this. Phoenix: You think? Real whiz-kids can work under any condition, you know. Maya: ...! Phoenix: (She's trying to hint that I should tidy my desk more. I'll clean up my desk when Maya stops asking silly questions... No hurry then.) Maya: Hey! This calendar... Phoenix: What about it...? If this is another hint about tidying, you can forget it. Maya: Someone's marked December 3rd in red pen! Phoenix: December 3rd? That's the day Mr. Elg was murdered! Is there anything else? Maya: Yeah. Umm... It says, \"Meet with The Tiger.\" Phoenix: The T-Tiger? Glen's Calendar added to the Court Record. Horse calendar (subsequent times) Maya: Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess! Phoenix: Looks pretty average to me. Maya: But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this. Phoenix: You think? Real whiz-kids can work under any condition, you know. Maya: ...! Phoenix: (She's trying to hint that I should tidy my desk more. I'll clean up my desk when Maya stops asking silly questions... No hurry then.) Talk Blue Screens, Inc. Phoenix: So... What exactly is this firm's business? Basil: I will try to simplify it so that you can understand... We analyze the data management systems required by certain branches of industry... ...and deliver optimum operating system and source-level components. Maya: Huh? You lost me on the corner of Analyze and Management. Phoenix: It doesn't matter. They analyze stuff. You got that much, right? Basil: The software we produce is distributed on CDs. Maya: CDs...? Basil: Yes. Compact disc. Digital optical storage media. Phoenix: (Of course, CDs are used for software as well as music...) Basil: It is a small firm, but all of my employees are first-class programmers. Let's ask one of them what they are doing. Excuse me. What are you working on right now? Programmer: I'm researching the impact of time-slicing common areas in multi-threaded code on logical access to shared global variables. Obviously, program structure heavily influences response time and performance, so the co-independence of global variables and memory overheads is vitally important to the success of the execution. Basil: Well, you get the idea. This is the sort of thing we are involved in. Did you good people follow all of that? Maya: Y-Y-Yeah... Phoenix: (Your blank smile just said otherwise, Maya.) What happened Phoenix: You know about what happened, right, Ms. Basil? Basil: You mean about Glen being poisoned? Yes, I know. It's terrible. Maya: Can you tell us anything that might be helpful? Basil: I don't think so. A police officer was here earlier, too. But I couldn't tell him anything either, because... ...the waitress who committed the crime has nothing to do with Blue Screens, Inc. Maya: Oh... Phoenix: How about Mr. Elg's desk? Have you cleared it out already? Basil: No, not yet. It's the one, right in front of you. If there's anything that might be useful to you, you are welcome to take it. Phoenix: (I guess there might be a clue here somewhere...) Glen's troubles (appears after presenting Glen Elg profile) Phoenix: Um, about Mr. Elg... Was he in some kind of trouble? Basil: I'm sorry? Why would you think that? Phoenix: I thought you said something about it just now? You said he got himself into trouble because he was a bit of a \"loser\". Basil: ... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Three Psyche-Locks?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock?] in the original release) Maya: I guess Mr. Elg is like every other man with his pile of secrets. Glen's troubles (subsequent times) Phoenix: Please tell us more about the trouble that Mr. Elg was in. Basil: I'm sorry. I don't know anything about that. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Basil: I do not pry into other people's affairs. Maya: She just gave us the dreaded \"professional, business-like cold-shoulder\", huh? Phoenix: (I need to find out exactly what the victim was involved in. Looks like I've got to break her in a \"professional, business-like\" manner!) Present Glen Elg profile Phoenix: Um, about Mr. Elg... Basil: He was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. But he did suffer from one or two bugs in his personality. Maya: Oh? Like what? Basil: He was a bit of a \"loser\"... Perhaps that would be the best way to describe it. That's what got him into trouble... ... Maya: What's the matter? Basil: He was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. So he was really no trouble at all. A model employee. Phoenix: Hey, wait a minute! Just now you said something about him being in trouble! (We've got to find out what this trouble was exactly.) Anything else Maya: Umm, would you mind taking a look at this? Basil: I'm sorry. That data is SuPer-Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected. Maya: SuPer Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected!? What!? This is madness! Phoenix: No, Maya. That is SPARDA. She won't tell us unless we say the right code word. Maya: A code word? Hmm... ... Sesame! Basil: ... Maya: If it's not \"sesame\", then it must be her mother's maiden name. That's how it always is. Phoenix: There's no point in having a password if it's always the same thing, Maya. (I guess she just doesn't want to talk about this.) Maya: Maybe we should focus on asking about Glen Elg. What do you say? Trés Bien Present Lisa Basil profile Gumshoe: That lady is the boss of Blue Screens, Inc., pal. Yeah... I figure she's clean. She got nothing to hide. She seemed kinda like a doll to me. In a good way and a bad way. ... Kinda makes you think she might be hiding something. Trés Bien (after breaking Psyche-Lock, then clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien, and clearing \"Tender Lender\" Talk option in Trés Bien - Kitchen) Gumshoe: Well, I'm gonna head back to the precinct now. We've got a big meeting starting in a bit. Maya: About Maggey's case, you mean? Gumshoe: No, that's pretty much wrapped up now... There's another big case going down at the moment, so she's been pushed aside... Maya: OK. Well, see you later then. Gumshoe: Bye! Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... Phoenix: ......... Y-You better get going, Detective, or you'll be late. Gumshoe: Actually, I, um... I've kinda got a favor to ask. It's a big one! Phoenix: A favor? Gumshoe: Yeah... It's for, um... Maggey, actually. I was kinda hoping... you'd give this to her for me. Maya: What is it? Gumshoe: It's a lunchbox. I got up early so I could make it. I've been real worried about her. She looked like she'd lost a lot of weight. Maya: Detective Gumshoe... ... How many weenies are in here!? There's not a person on earth who could down this much meat. Gumshoe: You think? I love weenies. I can't get enough of their tender juiciness. So will you give to her? It took me ages to make, so please say you will, pal! Phoenix: (I can't exactly say no, can I?) Gumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya to carry. Maya: Maybe I'll eat it myself if I get hungry! Gumshoe: Don't forget, OK? I'm counting on you to give that to Maggey. Phoenix: (He's finally gone...) January 7Tender Lender Maya: ...This place gives off a really strange vibe, doesn't it? Phoenix: Looks like \"The Tiger\" isn't in his lair. (And that is, as they say, a very good thing.) ???: ...Welcome... Phoenix: *gulp* (Talk about a creepy voice! It makes your soul want to shrivel up and die!) ???: You're here... to discuss a loan...? Phoenix: Uh, no. Not exactly... ???: The manager is away at the moment... Wait quietly... please... Maya: She's gone! Just like that! Phoenix: I guess we'll just have to come back another time. Maya: But this is the perfect opportunity, Nick! This place reeks of suspicion! Come on, Nick! Let's take a look around, OK? Phoenix: Do you think it'd be OK...? Maya: Of course! No one will ever know... ???: ...Coffee...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll leave it here for you to enjoy... Quietly. Phoenix: Y-Yes! Thank you! ???: Do not touch the desk... Please... Maya: N-N-Nick! Let's g-get out of here! Phoenix: (NOW she wants to get out of here...) Examine Desk on rug Phoenix: That's one impressive desk on one impressive rug! Maya: It's solid gold, Nick! Gold! Just look at that shine! Only real gold shines like that. Phoenix: Would you really want such a shiny desk, though? Maya: I don't know, but let's see what it's like to sit at a solid gold desk... Wow! I'm completely dazzled! Phoenix: That's because it's completely dazzling! Maya: I can see up my nose in the reflection! That's gotta be really distracting! Phoenix: (So the desk isn't practical. No surprise there.) Punching bag Maya: What's this? Phoenix: It's a punching bag. Maya: What!? No way. You wouldn't catch me walking around with a bag like that! Phoenix: What do you mean, \"walking around\"? Maya: The design's gross to start with, and it's way too heavy to be practical. And why's it called a \"punching\"-bag? Don't people know messenger bags are in! I knew it. I was right before, back at Trés Bien. Paris fashion is more my thing. Phoenix: (I really, really hope she's pulling my chain on this one.) CD player Phoenix: There's a CD player on the desk. But the desk is so loud, it's a wonder you can hear it. Maya: The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into. ???: Have you finished... ...the coffee? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Y-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely. ???: ... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... *gulp* ???: ...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup... Phoenix: (Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!) Maya: Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast... Phoenix: I-I sure hope so... (We better take a look at that CD while we're still alive and have the chance...) What the...!? Maya: What!? It's not the Rocko soundtrack, is it? Claw of the Tiger? Phoenix: It's... It's a demo CD... The artist's name has been hand-written on the disc in pen. \"MC Bomber\"... Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (This must be the CD Maggey told us about!) Maya: Let's listen to it! I bet it's heavy metal! Phoenix: No way! That woman'll make us drink more coffee if we do! MC Bomber added to the Court Record. CD player (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a CD player on the desk. But the desk is so loud, it's a wonder you can hear it. Maya: The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into. ???: Have you finished... ...the coffee? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Y-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely. ???: ... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... *gulp* ???: ...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup... Phoenix: (Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!) Maya: Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast... Phoenix: I-I sure hope so... Items on bookshelf Maya: Let's see... This round doll thing is called a \"daruma\"... I think. I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering. Phoenix: You mean you aren't making stuff up for a change? Maya: Heh. I bet you also didn't know that no matter what, he'll always right himself. Go on, Nick! Give him a good shove! Phoenix: Only if I feel like dying! Maya: Now, this yellow thing... This is a Japanese chess piece. I think it's a \"king\"? Not that I'm an expert or anything... I'm more of a Reversi person, you know. Phoenix: (Assuming she knows what she's talking about, these aren't exactly your typical... ...\"mobster wannabe\" items. They're not... \"trophies\", are they...? *gulp*) Maya: Hey... There's a piece of paper sticking out from under here. Phoenix: What is it? ...A repair bill? (Looks like he did some repair work on his car... Does he even have one...?) $15,000 to replace a bumper and a light!? That's insane! Maya: The car's registered to... the \"Cadaverinis\"? Phoenix: Huh? So it's not even The Tiger's car? (Why would someone else's repair bill be in The Tiger's office...?) Repair Bill added to the Court Record. Items on bookshelf (subsequent times) Maya: Let's see... This round doll thing is called a \"daruma\"... I think. I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering. Phoenix: You mean you aren't making stuff up for a change?

They're not... \"trophies\", are they...? *gulp*) Frame Phoenix: \"Win Through Compromise\"...? Maya: I wonder what that's supposed to mean... Phoenix: It must mean something if they took the trouble to frame it like that. Maya: Yeah well, it still doesn't make any sense to me... ???: ...That... Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: That's Tender Lender's guiding principle. Maya: Oh? ???: \"Compromise the customer to win.\" Maya: O-Oh, I see... How about you, Nick...? Phoenix: Yeah, umm... Well, as long as we don't have to compromise my hair, I'd say we're OK... (That's one slogan no business owner should ever explain to their customers... *shudder*) Spilled ashtray Maya: Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up. Phoenix: Yeah. It's all over the rug and everything. Maya: I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal. Phoenix: (How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?) Maya: Oh, hey! There's a book of matches here, too! Phoenix: Matches, huh? Places don't give those out much nowadays. ...Hey, wait a second! Maya: What is it? Phoenix: Look what's printed on its cover! It says, \"Trés Bien\"! (Changed from [Look what's printed on the back! It says, 'Trés Bien'!] in the original release) Trés Bien Matches added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (These matches could come in handy. We might be able to use them...) Maya: Yeah. The pilot light for the office boiler keeps going out. Phoenix: Swing and a miss, Maya. Swing and a miss. Spilled ashtray (subsequent times) Maya: Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up. Phoenix: Yeah. It's all over the rug and everything. Maya: I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal. Phoenix: (How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?) Hanging clothes Maya: Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic! Phoenix: (Looks more like a pimp coat to me... Guess I haven't got an eye for fashion.) Maya: Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick. Phoenix: Hmm... The same color as my suit...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Keep your voice down, Maya! Maya: N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this! ???: Some cake...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll just leave it here for you... Maya: Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks... ???: Just wait here quietly... Otherwise... Maya: S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said! Phoenix: Y-Yeah! Sure! ???: I have my eye on you... Only so I can \"take care of you\".... Understand...? Maya: Aah! I'm scared, Nick! Phoenix: ...So? What were you getting so excited about before? Maya: Look, on the lapel of this suit... Phoenix: That's...! That's an attorney's badge! Maya: Is The Tiger a lawyer!? Phoenix: No way! Look at this thing! It's made of paper! (Changed from [No way! Look at this badge! It's made of paper!] in the original release) Paper Badge added to the Court Record. Maya: For some reason, your badge suddenly looks really cheap to me, Nick. Phoenix: (Why doesn't anyone recognize an obviously fake badge when they see one...?) Hanging clothes (subsequent times) Maya: Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic! Phoenix: (Looks more like a pimp coat to me... Guess I haven't got an eye for fashion.) Maya: Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick. Phoenix: Hmm... The same color as my suit...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Keep your voice down, Maya! Maya: N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this! ???: Some cake...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll just leave it here for you... Maya: Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks... ???: Just wait here quietly... Otherwise... Maya: S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said! Phoenix: Y-Yeah! Sure! ???: I have my eye on you... Only so I can \"take care of you\".... Understand...? Maya: Aah! I'm scared, Nick! After examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes: ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Come out from under the desk, Maya!) The Tiger: Whad are youse two snoopin' around in my office for!? Phoenix: N-Nothing. W-We were just... The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! My precious carpet! Youse got ash on my rug! You' gonna wish your ugly feet never came through my door! Phoenix: I-It wasn't us! It was already like th-- The Tiger: Youse wanna argue with me!? Is that what you' doin'? You dink youse can take me on!? I'm gonna flatten youse two into pancakes and turn youse into my new rugs! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: ...Oh... Don Tigre... You're back... Phoenix: (Ack... That voice... It's like evil seeping into your head through your ears...) ???: ...I'm sorry... Don Tigre... I knocked over that ashtray before... and... Phoenix: (Eek! Has she got a death wish or what!?) The Tiger: ... Oh, right. Phoenix: Huh? The Tiger: F-Forget about it, Violetta. I-It's noddin'... Phoenix: (What, what, what!?) The Tiger: I ain't gonna get mad at you. You' too cute, you hear! Phoenix: (That's so unfair!) ???: Here... Have some cookies... I just baked them... And you'll need some strong espresso... while you're discussing your loan... The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: Y-Yes!? The Tiger: Youse either crazy or just plain stupid to chase after me! I worked so hard, but now youse gotta come and mess up my plan... Phoenix: (So it was him... He's my phony...) The Tiger: Heh, but I don't care. No one gets in my way! Phoenix: Wh-What? I mean, e-excuse me? The Tiger: Heh heh heh! Youse shoulda left de little girl at home, Wright. Phoenix: Um... I have a few things I want to ask-- The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! The Tiger: No questions! Dis is de last time we meet! Phoenix: Ack! Wait! P-Please! Maya: ...That was pretty weak, Nick. You waited until he was out of earshot before you shouted after him. Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk! I didn't hear you scream, \"Hold it!\" either!) ???: ...The espresso... Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: ...And cookies... Phoenix: (This woman is definitely not good for my heart. Now, what was it The Tiger called her...? \"Violetta\"?) Talk Tender Lender Phoenix: So... I'm kind of curious about your company, Tender Lender... Violetta: ...With the warm and friendly atmosphere you'd expect from a family-sized business... ...a conscientious rate of interest... and an attractive repayment policy... Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling this sentence is not going to end well...?) Violetta: ...we will tenderly lend you that little bit extra, here at Tender Lender. Maya: Hey, Nick. Things are a bit tight for Wright and Co. at the moment, aren't they? I mean there's that 500 dollars you owe me from our card game for starters. Why don't you take out a loan? Phoenix: (Would I like to take out a loan from a place like this? Not so much...) Violetta: Tender Lender is... on your side... Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: So, um, let's say I'm late with my repayment... What happens then? Violetta: ...We'd give you more coffee... ...Strong coffee... Phoenix: Um, right... I think I'd rather skip down! Maya: Hey! Just remember I can make strong coffee too, Nick! Strong tea, as well! What happened Phoenix: So, um, do you know about the incident we're investigating? Violetta: What incident...? Maya: Well, a man was poisoned in a restaurant just near here. That incident. Violetta: Let me see... I was here that day, with the manager... Phoenix: The manager being The Tiger...? Violetta: ...Furio Tigre... Maya: F-Furio... Phoenix: ...T-Tigre? (So that's where the \"Tiger\" thing comes from...) Maya: Xin Eohp's got a real name! Nick! Hurry up and find out more about him! Saved your life? (appears after presenting Furio Tigre profile) Violetta: I'm very... frail, you see... Just recently, I... died... Once... Hee... Hee... Maya: You d-died!? Violetta: About 4 months ago... The doctors said to... abandon all hope... Phoenix: (I guess they were expecting her to take a boat ride across the River Styx.) Violetta: But Don Tigre... He saved me. He gave up everything... Maya: Everything!? Violetta: When I found out what he had done for me, I... was happy... Maya: No offense, but I'm finding that a little hard to believe. Violetta: I decided I'd pay him back... with my life... by serving him coffee... and espresso... Phoenix: (I still wonder about what's in her coffee...) So... is that why you've got that bandage around your head? Violetta: Hee... Hee... Hee... This? The head bandage (appears after \"Saved your life?\") Phoenix: Um, so what's the story with the bandage? Violetta: ... They put it on after the operation... Maya: Operation? Violetta: It's just a little injury... A little, fatal, injury... Hee... Hee... Hee... Maya: A f-f-fatal injury!? Phoenix: (Maya just suffered one herself, by the sound of it...) So, that's the injury you were talking about before when you said you had died once? Violetta: ... 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: ...! Maya: Urgh! She really creeps me out, Nick! Phoenix: (Same here. But we've got to find out the truth!) The head bandage (subsequent times) Violetta: It was very complicated... The operation... They opened up my head... And performed surgery on my frontal lobe... Maya: Urgh! Just thinking about it sends shivers down my spine! Phoenix: So how did you get this \"fatal injury\" that left you needing an operation? 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Violetta: I made a promise to Don Tigre... I said I would never tell... Cross my heart and hope to drink 100 cups of espresso... Phoenix: Oh. (That much caffeine would raise anyone from the dead!) Violetta: Besides... It's a very precious memory to me... Phoenix: A... A precious memory...? (I'll never find out what she means if I can't break her...) Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Can I ask you about The Tiger, I mean, Mr. Tigre? Violetta: ...Cookie...? Maya: S-Sure...? Violetta: How do you like my cookies? I baked them myself... Hee... Hee... Hee... Maya: Go ahead, Nick! The honor is all yours! Phoenix: No, no! Ladies first, Maya! Violetta: Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: (No matter how I look at this, I just don't get it... What are The Tiger and this scary girl doing working together?) Violetta: We... are lovers... Phoenix: (That's not exactly coming across in your tone of voice...) Violetta: And I owe Don Tigre my life... He's the one who saved me... Phoenix: The Tiger... saved you...!? Violetta: Please, address him properly as \"Don Tigre\". Otherwise, I'll have to... Phoenix: OK, OK! Don Tigre! Of course! I'm sorry. (He saved her life? I'd sure like to how that happened.) Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Violetta: More coffee...? You must have more... Phoenix: No! Um, thanks! I've had enough. Really! (I'm so thirsty!) Violetta: I don't leave the office... I can't tell you about anything... except Don Tigre. January 7Vitamin Square Maya: There he is! Old Seedy's back feeding the pigeons again! Kudo: There! Take this! And this! And get out of my park! Phoenix: Like I thought, he's really mad... Come on, Maya. Just keep your head down and let's sneak away while we still can... Maya: What? Why? Hellooo, old man! Phoenix: What are you doing, Maya!? Kudo: Huh!? ...Kah! Maya: Hey, he just turned his back on us! Phoenix: I'm not surprised. I bet I really hurt his pride in court this morning. Maya: Hey, Mr. Kudo! Kudo: Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Hmm, pi-pi-pigeon, hmm... Kah! Maya: Look, we really need to talk to you, alright? Kudo: Out with the demons! In with good fortune! Maya: Ow! Ow! Ow! Seeds... Shell splinters... Painful... Phoenix: I always knew you were a demon, Maya! Talk Today's trial Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry about what happened in court earlier today. Kudo: Kah! Everyone'll be talking about me behind my back now! A dirty old man who was so busy looking at the serving girl's backside... ...that he can't remember her face! A filthy, depraved animal! Phoenix: N-Not at all! Kudo: Are you listening to me, boy!? I don't care what you say, I saw that waitress put it in! She put some white powder into the young lad's javaccino! Maya: We hear you... Kudo: And another thing! The young layabout was wearing an earpiece! On the same side as the lens of his broken spectacles! Maya: W-We're really sorry... Kudo: So I made a little mistake about the vase. So what!? I know what I saw! I tell you, I tell you, I tell you! Phoenix: OK, OK! Take it easy, please, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Don't tell me to take it easy, you spikey-haired brat! Take this! Embroiderer Maya: Um... You said you were a craftsman, right? Kudo: Kah! The modern world casts honest craftsmen like me aside in droves! Maya: S-Surely it's not that... Kudo: I come from a long line of craftsmen. Right back to the time of the shoguns! Do you hear me!? I didn't become an embroiderer, I was BORN one! Maya: Actually... I'm kind of in the same situation myself. Kudo: I... I... I wanted to stick my fingers up that dribbling old judge's nose... ...and scream right down his earhole... \"Objection!\" Maya: Oh... So, did you want to become a lawyer when you were young...? Phoenix: I don't think that's quite it, Maya. I think he's just in a bad mood, that's all... Kudo: I've got a tsunami of frustration inside and it's ready to burst out! Phoenix: (If we let him start rambling now, we might never shut him up! What should I do?) Cut in Phoenix: Um, actually, we've got places to go, things to check and stuff... Maybe another time? Kudo: Fine! Whatever! Just don't forget! I've got a tsunami's worth of grumbling to do. Phoenix: Yes, yes. This girl right here is really looking forward to hearing it all. Honest! Maya: What!? I never said that! Kudo: Come to the place where I work, then. Here. Bring this along with you. Phoenix: (What is this? It's covered in seeds... A discount coupon for a burger!?) Maya: He really wants someone to grumble at, huh? ...Although, it IS a burger joint... Leads back to Talk options Suck it up Phoenix: (Guess I better let him talk...) So, there's not much call for craftsmen these days, then? Kudo: Of course not, you idiot! All I'm good for nowadays is running errands! Maya: Errands? Kudo: Everyone takes advantage of the elderly! \"Buy some bread, gramps!\" \"Take the dog for a walk, granddad!\" \"Feed the pigeons, old man!\" What am I? Some sort of two-bit community handyman!? Maya: Um, well... Kudo: \"Buy some bread\", now that I can understand. But what's the point of feeding some seedy pigeons!? Why don't people say what they mean!? \"Get lost!\" That's what they're trying to say! Oh, yes! I'm just an inconvenience, you see! At home... At that restaurant... I just get in the way, don't I!? Phoenix: I-I'm sure you don't. (Wait a minute! What did he just say? At home and... at that restaurant?) Hold up... By \"restaurant\", are you talking about Trés Bien? Did you get asked to run an errand there, too? Kudo: Yes, I did! The very day that young brat was poisoned. Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? Leads back to Talk options The \"errand\" (appears after selecting \"Suck it up\" upon selecting \"Embroiderer\" Talk option) Phoenix: So on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do? Kudo: Glad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me. Armstrong: \"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!\" Kudo: \"Call them yourself!\" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time. Maya: So, did you end up calling the police? Kudo: Like I said, I was in a bit of a daze. Phoenix: Did you call them on your cell phone? Kudo: Kah! Do I look like I'd have one of those new-fangled thingamajigs? I went out looking for a pay phone, of course! Maya: You went looking for one...? Kudo: I couldn't find one right away, you know. Wandered around for 5 minutes or so. Maya: F-Five minutes...? Phoenix: So for five minutes after the incident happened... Kudo: Yessiree, the owner was at Trés Bien on his own. Phoenix: Why didn't you mention this in court this morning? Kudo: Well, I would have if you'd given me the chance! But you all bullied me out of the courtroom! Judge: *sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today. Kudo: WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else... Judge: Bailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom! Kudo: It's not my fault! You're the ones to blame! Phoenix: You could have at least told us before we got to court. Maya: Is it really that important that Mr. Kudo was the one who called the police...? Phoenix: (What's important is the unaccounted time before the police arrived. The victim was dead, and Maggey was unconscious. Which leaves that woman... I mean, that man, alone in the restaurant!) Mr. Kudo might have been chased out of the place on purpose. Maya: What do you mean? Phoenix: Maybe a certain someone didn't want him in the restaurant. Maya: Ah! Kudo: Oh, sure! You go ahead and say I was in the way as usual! I suppose I should've been getting myself covered in pigeon poop instead, hmm? Phoenix: (We need to get more details about what exactly happened... ...from Maggey... and from Mr. Armstrong!) The \"errand\" (subsequent times) Phoenix: So on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do? Kudo: Glad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me. Armstrong: \"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!\" Kudo: \"Call them yourself!\" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time. Maya: So, did you end up calling the police? Kudo: Like I said, I was in a bit of a daze. Phoenix: Did you call them on your cell phone? Kudo: Kah! Do I look like I'd have one of those new-fangled thingamajigs? I went out looking for a pay phone, of course! Maya: You went looking for one...? Kudo: I couldn't find one right away, you know. Wandered around for 5 minutes or so. Maya: F-Five minutes...? Phoenix: So for five minutes after the incident happened... Kudo: Yessiree, the owner was at Trés Bien on his own. Present Anything Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this? Kudo: ... Kah! Phoenix: Excuse me... Kudo: You let me get a million of my grumbles off my chest, and I'll take one quick look. I've got an earthquake of frustration inside and it's ready to rumble! Phoenix: ...On second thought, forget it. A million grumbles for one quick look doesn't sound like a good deal... for me. After clearing \"The \"errand\"\" Talk option in Vitamin Square: January 7Trés BienKitchen Maya: Looks like Mr. Armstrong's out again. Phoenix: But the place is open for business... You can't have an open restaurant without a chef! Maya: Hey! It's not my fault, Nick! Don't take it out on me! Phoenix: (Only a couple of minutes after the incident happened... Mr. Kudo left the scene, leaving Mr. Armstrong here alone.) Maya: Argh... Missing when we need to talk to him the most. Phoenix: (Maybe he's trying to avoid us on purpose?) After breaking Psyche-Lock, clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien: January 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room Byrde: Oh, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Hello, Maggey. So they finished questioning you? Byrde: Wasn't it just unbelievable in court today, sir!? I'm going to stay up all night and blog about everything that happened! Maya: Weren't you scared? It was pretty touch and go in there. Byrde: Yeah, but you totally nailed that old man! Phoenix: Well, he was all over the place with his testimony. Byrde: He's not the only one! Maya: Huh? What do you mean? Byrde: Everyone else's testimonies don't match up either. Not with what I remember of the incident, anyway... Phoenix: (Is it possible she is the one misremembering things...?) Talk Contradictions Maya: Maggey... You know how you said that everyone else... ...provided testimony that didn't match up with what you remembered? Byrde: Yup. There are just so many things that don't seem to add up. The biggest contradiction is the other guy I saw at the victim's table. HE was the one who slipped something into the victim's coffee. I'm sure it was him! Phoenix: (But didn't Mr. Kudo testify earlier today... ...that it was the waitress who put some white powder into the coffee cup...?) Maya: So you really think it was this \"disappearing man\" that did it...? Byrde: Well, he's not the only thing that disappeared. The CD vanished as well. You know, the CD with the writing on it. Maya: Oh, yeah. The \"MC Screwdriver\" album, right? Phoenix: It was \"MC Bomber\", Maya. That name was scrawled on the sports paper as well. Byrde: They never did find that CD at the crime scene, sir. Phoenix: (Or the victim's medication. That's gone missing, too.) Maya: Ouch, my head... This is getting way too complicated for me! After the incident Phoenix: You said that you passed out when the victim, Glen Elg, collapsed, right? Byrde: Yes. It's so embarrassing. I mean, I used to be a cop! When I came to, the restaurant was buzzing with police. And before I knew what was going on, they arrested me, sir. Phoenix: So between the time the victim collapsed and the time the police arrived on the scene... ...you have no idea what went on at Trés Bien. Byrde: No. No idea at all. Why? Is it important, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The other witness, the old man from the park, was pretty much chased out of the picture. Byrde: \"Chased out of the picture\"? What do you mean? Maya: Old Seedy wasn't inside the restaurant because he was told to go call the police. Phoenix: Exactly. And you, Maggey, were unconscious. That means Mr. Armstrong was alone in the restaurant for a brief period of time. Byrde: No... Y-You don't think Mr. Armstrong... set me up... do you? Phoenix: When you consider the facts... ...it's hard to imagine that Mr. Armstrong isn't involved in this at all. Byrde: Grr! It's like the master biting the paw of the dog that it feeds! Are you sure about this, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Well, the old man said as much when we spoke with him earlier. Byrde: I don't know. The things that man says don't add up for some reason, sir... Phoenix: (Maggey looks like she's trying to figure something out...) Maya: We'd better find outexactly what happened to the old man on that day. Victor's testimony (appears after presenting Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile) Phoenix: Is there anything about Mr. Kudo's testimony that stood out as odd to you? Byrde: Actually... Yes. The fact that he was even testifying to begin with doesn't quite... Maya: ...? \"Doesn't quite\" what? Byrde: Well, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant. Phoenix: (Yeah, we know that already. It was Victor Kudo.) Byrde: But I can't really say it was an old man. Maya: OK, then how about calling him a really old middle-aged man! Byrde: No, age isn't the issue. The other customer was a woman. Phoenix: A woman!? Maya: Are you sure, Maggey!? Byrde: Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I think so. Maya: So? What did this woman look like? Byrde: Umm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh. Phoenix: \"Creepy\"? Maya: \"Cackling\"? Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling I've come across a woman like that recently?) Present Sports Paper Byrde: That's the paper the victim had with him, isn't it? Maya: That's what we think, madam. Byrde: I kind of remember him having a paper, actually. And I remember something about this \"MC Bomber\", too. Maya: It was written on the CD that disappeared as well, wasn't it? Byrde: I don't suppose it makes any difference if there was one CD or two, right? Magazine Clipping Byrde: Just thinking about the trial that day gives me the creeps. Maya: Was it that bad? Phoenix: D-Don't forget that was my phony, not me! Byrde: He was supposed to say, \"Surely the defendant isn't the real criminal!\" But instead he shouted out, \"Surely the defendant is the real criminal!\" ...By mistake. Maya: Oh, ouch. Phoenix: L-Like I said, that was my phony, not me! Byrde: I...! I don't want to think about it anymore... Phoenix: (Trust me, neither do I...) Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile Byrde: Ah, I feel much better after the trial this morning. I've been a bit of a courtroom proceedings addict for years now. It feels like forever since I was a witness as slippery as that old man. Maya: He's not really that bad of an old man though. Byrde: Still, I feel a bit uneasy. Maya: Huh? I thought you just said you felt much better... Phoenix: Maggey. If there's something on your mind, you've got to tell us. Especially if it has anything to do with Mr. Kudo or his testimony. Byrde: Roger! I'll spill it all and see what you make of it! Coffee Cup Byrde: That's the cup I took over to the table, sir. But! I didn't put anything in it... I just... I could never do something like that! Maya: That's right! You could never do anything like that! Byrde: I'm not good at carrying those large trays, you know. Trying to balance a tray with one hand to put something in the coffee with the other... That'd just be asking for trouble. I'd drop something, for sure! Maya: Th-That's right! Phoenix: (...I-Is she expecting me to claim that she's too clumsy to have committed the crime...?) Apron Byrde: Oh, yeah. That's from when I was carrying a customer's breakfast over to them. Phoenix: The ketchup splotch, you mean? Byrde: My whole face was fire-engine red, thanks to that stuff. Maya: But you spilled the ketchup in your apron, didn't you? I don't see how... Byrde: The ketchup-covered omelet went flying and hit the customer in the face. Maya: Oh, talk about a tomato-red face! Makes me wish I could've seen it myself. Byrde: Yeah, I guess... It was kind of a sight to behold. Potassium Cyanide Byrde: Potassium cyanide? I've never heard of that poison before in my life, sir! Phoenix: ... Byrde: OK, maybe I have. But I've never seen it before. That's the truth. I wouldn't even know where the nearest potassium cyanide dealer is in the first place. Maya: Potassium cyanide dealers? Sounds like another group of drug pushers to avoid... Phoenix: In any case, this definitely isn't something you can pick up just anywhere. Byrde: Ooh!! Curse my rotten luck! The criminal must've stuck the bottle in my apron while I was unconscious! Gumshoe's Lunchbox Phoenix: Oh, yeah! I've got something you're going to love! Byrde: Really? What is it!? Phoenix: A lunchbox, just for you. Here! Byrde: Wow! A lunchbox! Weenies, too! I can't believe it! Thank you, sir! Did you make this just for me, Mr. Wright? Maya: Nah, it was Detective Gumshoe! Who else would make such a nice lunchbox for you? Byrde: Detective Gumshoe? Maya: He's really worried about you. Looks like he put a lot of effort into making this, too! Byrde: ... I can't accept it. Detention Center rules. No gifts allowed, sir. Phoenix: Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't be like that. Byrde: The rules are the rules! They'll lock you up if you break them. Phoenix: (Somehow, when an ex-cop turned waitress says that, it seems a whole lot scarier.) Byrde: And anyway... I hate weenies! Maya: O-Oh... really? Byrde: It's all yours, Maya! You can enjoy it with Mr. Wright! Maya: B-But... Phoenix: ... She's right... It's better than letting it go to waste. Maya: But! ...I guess so. Gumshoe's Lunchbox eaten with Maya. Byrde: ... Well? How was it? Phoenix: That hit the spot! I love weenies. Byrde: Oh, good! I'm glad I gave it to you, then, sir! Paper Badge Byrde: Ah! Is that... your attorney's badge? Phoenix: Actually, it's a fake. Byrde: Hoooly smokes! That's it!! Maya: Huh? Byrde: That's the badge your phony had, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: You got duped by this...!? Maya: But it's a completely different color! Phoenix: And what about the fact that it's made of paper!? Byrde: He said the badge got a tan as well, while he was in Hawaii on business. Phoenix: (I'm beginning to see how my phony was able to gain her trust...) Glen Elg profile Byrde: Ah! That's the victim, isn't it? Phoenix: That day was the first time you'd ever seen this man, right? Byrde: Yes. I'd never met or seen him before then. I just happened to be the waitress who served him his coffee, sir. That's all! Phoenix: It seems he was a computer programmer. Byrde: Really? I'm useless with computers. Completely hopeless. I don't know any computer programs. Phoenix: (Did she mean \"programmers\"?) Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Back when I was an officer, Detective Gumshoe always looked out for me. But today! Today I was the one who had to look out for him; trying to incriminate me the whole time! Phoenix: You've got to remember, Maggey. Gumshoe's a detective. He's got a job to do. Byrde: My old boss... I thought at least he'd be on my side. Maya: He is on your side! He'd do anything to help y-- Byrde: You can't fool me! I saw him in court today! I felt like a poor little baby woodpecker being pecked on the head by its own mother! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's testimony was pretty solid... No wonder it hurt her so much.) Byrde: I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again! Phoenix: (Ouch. I think I just saw Gumshoe's chances go down in flames like the Hindenburg...) Maya: I don't think it's getting through to her that he really was trying to help... Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Mr. Armstrong was very good to me after I was fired from the force. I can't believe someone as nice as him could have anything to do with this... Phoenix: (Well, in the time between the victim being poisoned and the police being called... ...the only person who was on the scene and had a chance to do anything... ...was Mr. Armstrong. There was no one else there.) Byrde: M-Mr. Armstrong wouldn't... He wouldn't set me up... would he!? Furio Tigre profile Byrde: Hoooly smokes! That's him!! Maya: Huh? Byrde: That's your phony, Mr. Wright! Just look at that ridiculous suntan! Phoenix: Um... For the record, I'm not sunburned like an over-dried tomato so I don't know... Byrde: He told me he'd been on a business trip to Hawaii and that's where he got the tan. Phoenix: (I'm not hearing this...) Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be in the police force. But I'm incarcerated, now. I don't pick up much information in here. All I can help you out with now is the menu at Trés Bien. Maya: Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't let your spirits fall! After examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes in Tender Lender, and clearing \"Victor's testimony\" Talk option and presenting Gumshoe's Lunchbox in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Detective: The main server just went up in smoke! Why the heck isn't the press conference set up yet!? The Superintendent's here already! Chief: Yeah. And there's a problem with the Internet, too. Detective: I already told you to stop using your computer, Chief! Chief: But I'm watching videos online! I'm catching up on my Asian soap operas! Detective: It's gonna have to wait, Chief. I'm throwing the switch! Chief: Nooo! Just when Sum Yung-Gai was about to confess to his son's hot-to-trot girlfriend! Maya: Wow! This place is really buzzing. Phoenix: Something must be going down. Something really big. Gumshoe: Huh!? What are you doing here, pal? Maya: Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: You can't be here right now. You'll be roped into the briefing if you stay. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: We've got big problems here today. Maya: Why? What's going on? Gumshoe: It's a virus! A virus!! Phoenix: (A virus?) Gumshoe: There's a virus ripping through the precinct's computer system. Phoenix: (But I really need to ask you some questions...) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Your batteries won't last forever. Remember that when you're having fun... in bed.\" We have a winner! A little joke to make people think about their smoke alarms. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a fire safety campaign... ...I guess? ...Does he even know what he's trying to get across anymore? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut. Chief: Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to read the paper now. Phoenix: (Alternately, you could read some reports... Just a suggestion.) Chief: What the heck is this!? This paper's more than a month old! And someone's written all over it! Who's the clown that put this on my desk? Well? Speak up! Maya: He just wadded it up and chucked it in the trash! Phoenix: But that's an important piece of evidence! Talk Tender Lender Gumshoe: OK, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up! Maya: Y-Yes! Gumshoe: No matter how poor you get, never borrow money from a place like this, you hear? Maya: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: If you got money trouble, just go on a diet of instant noodles and hang in there! Phoenix: Ah, we're not thinking about borrowing money, Detective! We want information. Gumshoe: Oh... Is that all? Well, let's see... Tender Lender is considered to be even fishier than the average illegal loan shark. And it seems it ran into trouble just recently. Those guys have been pretty heavy-handed, calling in all their debts. Maya: Really? Gumshoe: Don't go poking your nose around in their business, pal. You'll really regret it if you upset that lady. Phoenix: Alright, I get the picture. (Hey, wait a minute! What did he just say!? \"That lady\"?) Maya: Who's this lady he's talking about, Nick? Phoenix: (We better find out what the story is with this \"lady\"...) Computer viruses Maya: So what exactly is a computer virus, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I dunno. Maya: What? Gumshoe: Look, I just go with the flow, alright, pal? Phoenix: (And here I thought detectives were supposed to be somewhat knowledgeable...) Gumshoe: What's with that face, pal? You think you know what a virus is? Maya: Well, Nick? Do you? Phoenix: A computer virus? Sure. I mean, only in simple terms, of course. Maya: Really? Wow, you know everything. Professor Nick! Gumshoe: Yeah. I'm gonna call you Dr. Wright from now on! Maya: Hey, that sounds pretty cool! Don't you agree, Dr. Wright? Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling they're making fun of me?) OK, fine. I'm no expert, but I can at least explain the basics to the two of you. What's a virus? (appears after \"Computer viruses\") Phoenix: A virus is a program that gets inside a computer and causes damage. Gumshoe: Damage? You mean it makes the machine go \"boom\" and explode? Phoenix: No. The damage is, um... Well, it's all internal. Maya: So the inside goes \"boom\", right? Phoenix: Imagine all the case data you've got stored on your PCs here in the station... A virus could wipe out all that. That's the kind of damage I'm talking about. Maya: Whoa! That's scary. Phoenix: Yeah. And what's even more scary is that viruses are infectious. Maya: Infectious? Phoenix: Most computers are connected together on a network, right? A virus can move on machine to another over the network. So the virus just keeps spreading faster and faster. Gumshoe: Hmph. Just like a real virus, huh. Maya: But, Nick! Why would anyone want to make a program like that? Gumshoe: Yeah. It takes ages to type in all that data. Why would you wanna destroy it, pal? Phoenix: No. People don't infect their own machines. They send the virus to someone else's. Maya: What!? That's horrible! Gumshoe: Oh, I get it... It's like you sneezing on Godot so he catches a cold. Maya: Right! Then he wouldn't be able to turn up in court because he'd be too sick. You really shouldn't do stuff like that, Nick. It's wrong. Phoenix: Who? What? Where? When and why did the conversation jump to talking about me!? Anyway, that's what a computer virus is. A bad program that causes damage. Gumshoe: And all the different viruses have names, right? I kinda feel like I've heard the name of the virus we caught somewhere before. Phoenix: (The name of the virus, huh? I feel like I've heard of it before, too...) MC Bomber (appears after presenting Sports Paper or MC Bomber) Gumshoe: We already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met. Maya: Who are they? Gumshoe: I dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess. Phoenix: And now the virus has been released, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival! Maya: All this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie! Gumshoe: Apparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market. Phoenix: You mean someone put this virus up for sale? Gumshoe: Yeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal. Phoenix: (In the millions!? A virus can be worth that much!?) MC Bomber updated in the Court Record. MC Bomber (subsequent times) Gumshoe: We already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met. Maya: Who are they? Gumshoe: I dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess. Phoenix: And now the virus has been released, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival! Maya: All this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie! Gumshoe: Apparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market. Phoenix: You mean someone put this virus up for sale? Gumshoe: Yeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal. Phoenix: (In the millions!? A virus can be worth that much!?) The Cadaverinis (appears after presenting Violetta profile) Phoenix: I'm not sure if I really want to get involved in this, but who are the Cadaverinis? Gumshoe: Who are they? A scary bunch of people, that's who! Phoenix: (You're a cop, and you're scared? What's that about?) Gumshoe: Trust me, it doesn't matter if you're kid or a cop, these guys are scary. They've got some serious clout in the criminal underworld. We can't touch them. They've got too much moola. Phoenix: Moola...? As in? Gumshoe: They pretty much control all the cash on the city's black market. Phoenix: The black market, huh? And that includes Tender Lender, I take it? Gumshoe: Sure. No one stands up to Bruto Cadaverini. And I mean, no one! Phoenix: (Interesting...) Maya: So Viola's the granddaughter of some mafia boss then? Gumshoe: Yeah. And everyone know how much Bruto loves his little girl. She means everything to him. Phoenix: So... How did she end up at Tender Lender? Gumshoe: I dunno, pal. But I heard she and the boss of the Tender Lender are pretty tight. Maya: Tight? Gumshoe: That's what it said in a file I read related to Maggey's case. Phoenix: (Sounds like a pretty important clue.) Present Sports Paper or MC Bomber Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, umm... about this... Gumshoe: What!? I'm trying to concentrate on Maggey and this virus right now, so I... Aaaaaaaaaaah!! This is it! This stupid name! I remember now! Phoenix: (I thought so. Here it comes...) Maya: Don't just nod to yourself and keep me in the dark, Nick! What's going on!? Phoenix: It's OK, Maya! You don't have to cry about it! Gumshoe: The name scribbled on that sports paper and written on that CD... That's the name of the virus! \"MC Bomber\"! Maya: WHAT!? Gumshoe: Yeah! The virus that's just infected every computer in the station, pal. It's MC Bomber! Phoenix: Can you give us any more details? Please? Glen Elg profile Gumshoe: This guy was a real programming genius. They called him \"the walking computer\" at the place where he worked. Maya: What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!? Phoenix: (*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!) Gumshoe: Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim. Violetta profile Gumshoe: That's the girl who works over at Tender Lender. You wanna stay away from her, OK? I mean it. Maya: She does look kind of unforgiving, doesn't she? Gumshoe: That should be the least of your worries, pal. Phoenix: (What's that supposed to mean? What could be worse...?) Gumshoe: Her name's Viola Cadaverini. She's the only granddaughter of Bruto Cadaverini. Maya: Bruto Cadaverini? Do you know who that is, Nick? Phoenix: Never heard of him. Gumshoe: Bruto Cadaverini's the boss of the Cadaverini family. Phoenix: The Cadaverinis? (That's one scary-sounding name!) Gumshoe: We can't touch them. They're way too powerful for the police. But you're thinking of taking them on, aren't you? Phoenix: N-No! I don't remember ever saying I was going to! (I better get some more info out of Gumshoe about this \"family\"...) Furio Tigre profile Gumshoe: Oh, this guy... The Tiger... Maya: Is he famous? Gumshoe: Yeah. This guy's not a loan shark, you know. Nope. He's a big loan cat! Phoenix: Hence the name? Gumshoe: Don't pay him back, and you'd better say your prayers, because he'll eat you alive. Maya: You're shaking, Detective. Phoenix: Like a leaf... Gumshoe: I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean. Bruto Cadaverini profile Gumshoe: I wouldn't go flashing that photo around if I were you, pal. Maya: Why not? Gumshoe: That guy rules the criminal underworld. You could get yourselves in serious trouble. I'm talking say-your-prayers trouble. Maya: You're shaking, Detective. Phoenix: Like a leaf... Gumshoe: I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean. After clearing \"MC Bomber\" and \"The Cadaverinis\" Talk options: Gumshoe: Aaaaargh! I can't believe it! I almost forgot the most important thing! Phoenix: A-And that is...? Gumshoe: You know, the lunchbox! How did everything go!? Phoenix: L-Lunchbox? Maya: You remember. The weenies...? Byrde: I hate weenies! Phoenix: (Oh, yeah... Those weenies.) Gumshoe: So? How did my weenies taste when they went down the hatch? Maya: Huh? Um... Well... It was... delicious! Gumshoe: Yeah? That's what she said? Really!? Maya: Umm... Well... Not exactly... Gumshoe: Don't worry about it, pal. I figured something would happen, so I came prepared. Phoenix: Prepared? What do you mean...? Gumshoe: I made a jumbo lunchbox! Maya: Oh... Gumshoe: Do me a favor again, huh, pal, and deliver this? Phoenix: (This sure is a heavy burden... In more ways than one...) Gumshoe: I can just imagine Maggey's little eyes sparkling with joy when you bring her that! Maya: ...Weenies, again, Nick? Tell me we don't have to eat all these too... Gumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya. Again. Maya: I really can't eat any more... Present Gumshoe's Lunchbox Gumshoe: Don't forget to give that to Maggey, OK? Maya: But they don't allow presents for the prisoners in the detention center, right...? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right... ... Well it doesn't matter. I'm counting on you to get it to her somehow. Phoenix: (I'm a lawyer, not a delivery boy, Gumshoe...) Blue Screens, Inc. Talk Glen's troubles (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Basil: Glen's head had more processing power than any computer. But it had been infected with a \"gambling\" virus. Glen was... in too deep. Phoenix: You mean he was in debt? Basil: Yes. 100,000 dollars in debt. Not an easy amount to repay. So... He said he was taking on some extra work. Something a bit risky. Phoenix: \"Risky\"? How? Maya: Maybe he was going to become a waitress at Trés Bien!? Phoenix: (Where do you come up with these ideas!?) Risky extra work (appears after \"Glen's troubles\") Phoenix: So it's safe to say Mr. Elg was the creator of this virus, huh? Basil: The \"MC Bomber\" virus? Yes. It was a work of genius. In a bad sort of way, of course. But still genius. Something like that would probably fetch several million dollars on the black market. Phoenix: (Inconceivable! Gumshoe was right for a change!) This date, December 3rd, that is marked on his calendar... That was his deadline for repaying his debts. MC Bomber updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: (I guess we won't be needing these horse racing tickets any more.) Glen Elg's Losing Horse Racing Tickets thrown back on the floor. Maya: Use the trash can, Nick! Risky extra work (subsequent times) Phoenix: So it's safe to say Mr. Elg was the creator of this virus, huh? Basil: The \"MC Bomber\" virus? Yes. It was a work of genius. In a bad sort of way, of course. But still genius. Something like that would probably fetch several million dollars on the black market. Phoenix: (Inconceivable! Gumshoe was right for a change!) This date, December 3rd, that is marked on his calendar... That was his deadline for repaying his debts. Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Glen's Trouble -- Phoenix: So, how about you tell me what kind of trouble Mr. Elg was in? Basil: I'm sorry, sir, but we don't deal with trouble-shooting here. Perhaps you'd like to speak to someone in customer service? Phoenix: (What's she talking about!? I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...) Ms. Basil. Let me ask you something. Did Mr. Elg's troubles have something to do with this? Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Basil: What is that? Phoenix: A lottery ticket. There were a ton of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime. (Changed from [There were hundreds of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime.] in the original release) Basil: And what is the relevance of that? Phoenix: The victim, Mr. Glen Elg... ...had a gambling habit, didn't he? Basil: I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone dreams of being rich. Even I listen to Millionaire Radio. Phoenix: (She's right. That is a bit weak on its own.) But Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to the lottery, was it? Present Losing Horse Racing Tickets Phoenix: Leads to: \"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: Everyone likes to gamble from time to time. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: But be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc. Phoenix: (Looks like I got that one wrong.) Leads back to: \"I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts.\" Present Losing Horse Racing Tickets Phoenix: Basil: What is that? Phoenix: A bunch of horse racing tickets. All losing ones. Basil: With that many tickets, you could get 1 dollar at the recycling center. You good people are very, very bad. Cashing in on others' misfortunes is immoral. Phoenix: (...Is that a whiff of hypocrisy I smell?) (Changed from [...Why did I get a whiff of hypocrisy just now?] in the original release) Basil: But what is the relevance of these tickets? Phoenix: The victim, Mr. Glen Elg... He had a gambling habit, didn't he? Basil: I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone likes to go to the races from time to time. Phoenix: (Yeah, but not everyone buys this many tickets!) Basil: Anyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own. Phoenix: You're right. But I'm not through yet. Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to horse races, was it? Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: Everyone likes to gamble from time to time. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: But be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc. Phoenix: (Looks like I got that one wrong.) Leads back to: \"Anyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!? Basil: I'm not sure. Let's ask one of the programmers... Excuse me. Can you answer this man's query, please? Programmer: The data queue that manages system tasks for trouble-shooting requires that the multi-tasking simulation for local variables be put into sleep mode so that data transmission on active nodes can be bundled correctly according to the source code. ...Obviously. Basil: So I'm afraid that is the situation, you see. Did you good people follow all that? Phoenix: Not even slightly! What was all that mumbo-jumbo? Basil: It is exactly as my programmer explained. Phoenix: (I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.) Basil: Would you like to input another question? Leads back to: \"I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...\" Phoenix: The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times. That's got to have hurt his wallet pretty bad, don't you think? Maybe bad enough to be the cause of some pretty serious trouble perhaps!? Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Basil: You are right. Glen did have a gambling habit. You good people must not follow his example, do you understand? Phoenix: Trust me. Even if I wanted to, I don't exactly have the money to buy any. Basil: But... if you win, there's no problem, is there? And Glen had a winning ticket, didn't he? For half a million dollars? Phoenix: Yeah, but... Basil: It's hard to imagine how he could have been in trouble then, isn't it? Phoenix: It's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end. But that was his first stroke of good luck. He was in deep trouble before that. Basil: Deep trouble? What do you mean? Phoenix: Mr. Elg's real problem was with someone or something more terrifying and ferocious! Present Glen's Calendar Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Elg met with someone on the day he was killed. He even made a note on this calendar about the meeting: \"Meet with The Tiger.\" Basil: What is the relevance of that? Are you trying to suggest Glen was meeting him to discuss his debt? Phoenix: Y-Yeah. That's what I was thinking. Basil: But I have never heard anything about this \"Tiger\" before. Maybe he's not even human. Maybe he really is a tiger! Phoenix: (I'm no programmer, but does she really expect me to buy such messed up logic?) In that case, I think it's time to introduce you to The Tiger. Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\".\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!? Basil: I'm not sure. Let's ask one of the programmers... Excuse me. Can you answer this man's query, please? Programmer: The data queue that manages system tasks for trouble-shooting requires that the multi-tasking simulation for local variables be put into sleep mode so that data transmission on active nodes can be bundled correctly according to the source code. ...Obviously.

Phoenix: (I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.) Basil: Glen had a lot of friends, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"But I have never heard anything about this \"Tiger\" before.\" Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Phoenix: Furio Tigre... The boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\". Basil: \"Tender Lender\"!? People with businesses should think harder before naming their offices. Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk!) Well? What do you think? Basil: Our firm is doing very well at the moment. I don't think we need to borrow money. Phoenix: No, no, no! I mean about Mr. Elg! Basil: You think Glen had something to do with this Furio Tigre? Phoenix: Yes... Basil: I'm sorry. I don't know of any connection between the two of them. Phoenix: (Really? Because I've got proof that Mr. Elg and The Tiger knew each other.) Present Glen's Calendar Phoenix: Leads to: \"Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\".\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!?

Phoenix: (I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.) Basil: Glen had a lot of friends, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"You think Glen had something to do with this Furio Tigre?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: All good people get into trouble sometimes. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: Let's ask one of my programmers what they think... Excuse me? What do you think? Programmer: I'm taking a break. Basil: Yes. Perhaps I should take a break, too. Phoenix: (I wish I could take a break from my troubles, but the rest stop was about a mile back.) Leads back to: \"It's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end.\" Phoenix: Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\". This is who Mr. Elg met with on the day of his murder. And the only thing a loan shark would talk with him about would be his debt! Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Basil: It's true that Glen had racked up quite a bit of debt from his gambling habit. About 100,000 dollars, I think. Phoenix: (100,000 dollars? Ouch!) Basil: But I heard he won the lottery, so he should have been in the clear. Phoenix: (Shame Maggey couldn't get a bit of that good luck.) OK... ...So the guy got lucky and won the lottery. But what if he hadn't won? What was his plan then? Basil: Well... This isn't easy to say, but... He said he would use his talents to repay the money. Phoenix: His \"talents\"? Basil: I suspect he was talking about programming. Phoenix: Wh-What computer program is worth 100,000 dollars!? Basil: ... Perhaps you good people should leave so I can get back to my work. Phoenix: (I'm so close to cracking her!) The program in question... Was it by any chance... this!? Present MC Bomber (after clearing \"MC Bomber\" Talk option in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Well? This is it, isn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: This is a very delicate matter. Without the necessary data, there's really no way I can access the information. Phoenix: (I know Mr. Elg created some sort of program! She can't deny it if I show her the program itself as evidence!) Leads back to: \"I'm so close to cracking her!\" Phoenix: Well? This is it, isn't it? This is the virus that's infecting computers world-wide as we speak... \"MC Bomber\"! Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Tender Lender Talk The head bandage (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Viola: Four months ago... I was in a traffic accident... That's why I needed the operation... When I woke up... they told me it was nothing serious... A simple procedure... Maya: Oh! Really? Phoenix: (Well, I guess if she recovered in 4 months, it couldn't have been too big...) Viola: They said the operation... cost one million dollars... Maya: A... A... A million bucks!? Viola: My grandfather ordered Don Tigre to pay... One million dollars... In \"compensation\"... Maya: \"Compensation\", huh...? Phoenix: It's underworld lingo for paying money to settle a score. Basically, pay or get into some serious trouble! (But a million bucks!? This has to be related to our poisoning case somehow...) Compensation (appears after \"The head bandage\") Leads to: \"I wanted to believe him... I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said...\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Head Bandage -- Phoenix: You said that bandage around your head was from an operation? Viola: ... Phoenix: You also said you suffered a \"fatal injury\" to the head, correct? Viola: Yes... The operation was very... difficult, apparently... Phoenix: Now, by \"fatal injury\", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right? Viola: ... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: Did the injury in question have something to do with this? Present Repair Bill Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have here a car repair bill.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Viola: Donuts...? Phoenix: Huh? Viola: I baked them myself... Home-made donuts... Have one... Phoenix: Umm, what's inside? Viola: Jam, and... ... Phoenix: I'm sorry, but I didn't quite catch that... Viola: Hee... Hee... Phoenix: Um... Thanks, but no thanks... I think I'll pass. (I guess that was a flop. What happened to this woman for her to have such a huge bandage around her head? There must be some piece of evidence that'll prompt her to tell me what happened...) Leads back to: \"Now, by \"fatal injury\", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right?\" Phoenix: I have here a car repair bill. From this, it seems pretty obvious that this car was involved in an accident. Viola: Let me see that... ... This bill is made out to the \"Cadaverinis\"...? Phoenix: Y-Yes, it is. Viola: I don't think... I ever introduced myself... Tell me... what do the \"Cadaverinis\"... have to do with me...? Phoenix: (Something tells me she's not about to say hi and introduce herself... Alright, then...) Your relationship with the Cadaverinis is very strong... And this is why. Present Viola Cadaverini or Bruto Cadaverini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I know exactly who you are, Viola Cadaverini!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: So!? What do have to say for herself now!? Viola: Pretzels... For you... Phoenix: Huh? Viola: Don't worry about the little white specks on the surface... I just sprinkled a small quantity of... ...

Viola: ... 1 LOCK BROKEN Viola: It happened about 4 months ago... I was driving in one of our family's cars... when someone pulled out in front of me... It was a motorbike... or something like that... I don't remember it much... Anyway, I swerved to try to avoid it, but... ...I took a blow... to the head... A bad one. Phoenix: (Yeah, I can imagine...) So what happened to the person on the bike? I'm guessing they didn't get away with injuring THE Viola Cadaverini, right? Viola: I... don't know... what happened to them... They ran away... Or so I heard... Phoenix: Ran away? Viola: If they'd stayed, I'd have... Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: (Hmm, is it possible...?

(The person who caused the accident was riding a motorbike... Who could it be?) Leads back to: \"Hmm, is it possible...?

I refuse to believe it! 1 LOCK BROKEN Viola: We collided... The motorbike, and my car... But Don Tigre isn't injured at all... is he? Phoenix: (It was The Tiger who caused Viola to crash. I can feel it! Plus, one of her locks just broke, so she must suspect it was him, too...) I'm sorry, Ms. Cadaverini... But I have proof that The Tiger was involved in a traffic accident on his bike!

Hee... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: This repair bill was paid by Furio Tigre. The Cadaverinis have known for ages who caused the accident, haven't they? Viola: ... It's possible... Perhaps... Somewhere inside me... I know that may be true... Phoenix: (I knew it...) Viola: But... Don Tigre still saved my life... The operation was very complicated... It was very, very expensive... Phoenix: How much are we talking? Viola: ... Very, very, very expensive... Phoenix: (She seems kind of hesitant about giving me an actual figure. I should back off...) Well, anyway, it was The Tiger who paid for it, right? Viola: After I recovered... Don Tigre told me... He said he paid for the operation because... he cared about me... I... believe him... Phoenix: Really? But do you honestly believe that to be true? Viola: ... Phoenix: Do you want to know what I think...? I think the reason he paid the operation wasn't because of you, but someone else...

Leads back to: \"He said he paid for the operation because... he cared about me...\" Phoenix: Perhaps I shouldn't be saying this, but... ...your grandfather, Bruto Cadaverini, controls a lot of \"dubious\" cash, right? And you are his beloved pride and joy. Viola: ...

Maya: I thought I saw something suspicious under the corner of that rug! Viola: One wrong move and... you might disappear forever... Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: (This feels like Halloween... Only a whole lot more real... And a whole lot scarier, too.) Viola: I wanted to believe him... I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said... He said it had nothing to do with my grandfather being Bruto Cadaverini... I wanted to believe he helped me because he cared about me. Not about my grandfather... But I knew... That wasn't really true... Maya: Wow. I'm so sorry. Viola: What he did to get the money was... It was... evil! Phoenix: ...! Viola: He said it was all for me... So I... I helped him...

He was made an offer... He simply... couldn't... refuse. Viola's Medical Papers added to the Court Record. Maya: Wow, I feel so bad for Viola. Phoenix: It's inexcusable! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: (There are two things that I consider inexcusable. Poisoning, and betrayal! Only a coward would hurt people using either of these tactics.) Maya: Is everything alright, Nick?

The mirror was here, correct? Armstrong: Oui. Phoenix: Oui? Really!? Because I know if I were you, I wouldn't have put a mirror there! It would be in the way! Godot: Godot: Look who's talking, Trite. Phoenix: Huh? Godot: You're obstructing my view, among other things. Phoenix: But, but, but! This is my seat in the courtroom...! Godot: Trés Bien's \"charm\" is that it gives you the impression that you're the only customer. Temporarily placing a mirror in that spot would hardly be \"in the way\". Unlike you... Trite. Armstrong: I tell you, monsieur. la mirror was z'ere, in z'e middle of la restaurant.Armstrong: Z'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And where would that be!? Armstrong: Oh lá lá! Look 'ow you lean towards me! I always attract z'e younger boys! Maybe I should keep you in suspense a little longer! Judge: Mr. Armstrong! Tell the court what you know at once! Armstrong: I attract z'e older ones, too, you know, 'andsome! Shall I tease you, too!? Judge: Nnngh... Godot: I'm already seeing a very hot someone, so I'm afraid you'll be waiting for a long time. Maya: I bet she has mocha-cream skin and cappuccino perfume. Armstrong: Bien. I will tell you... Z'ere was only one seat from which you could 'ave seen...Armstrong: Z'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So why can you only see the victim from that particular seat? Armstrong: Mais, monsieur. It is obvious, non? If you look at la plans you will understand. La victim would 'ave been reflected in la mirror like so. If you were sitting at la table next to 'im, you would see everything, non? Maya: So that's the seat Old Seedy was sitting in on that day... ...when the poisoning happened. Phoenix: (The old man was sitting at the table next to the victim? Why does that seem kinda odd...?)Present Victor's Testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! Mr. Kudo's words yesterday strongly contradict Mr. Armstrong's testimony! Judge: This is... the letter of apology that was written by Mr. Kudo, is it not? Phoenix: I realize it looks useless, Your Honor, but this is still testimony. Godot: Ha...! I guess useless people are only really good at identifying useless things. Judge: What relevance does this scrap of paper have to the trial, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Mr. Kudo's testimony is actually very relevant to the question at hand, Your Honor! Because it very clearly contradicts with this piece of evidence! Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Phoenix: This piece of evidence contradicts with testimony we have heard, Your Honor! Judge: The crime photo...? Phoenix: Yes. This photo clearly shows something that theoretically should not exist! Judge: What on Earth do you mean by that, Mr. Wright!? Godot: \"Should not exist\"? Ha...

Phoenix: ... Godot: Heh heh... Maya: G-Godot actually laughed at something! Judge: Well, given the witness's physique, I suppose it is possible.

Suffering from a case of heartburn, Trite? Armstrong: Oh, I 'ave just z'e thing for z'at! An oil with golden myrrh and frankenstaince... Godot: Add a few drops to your coffee, and voila! Enjoy.

Armstrong: Oui. I would be delighted! Leads back to cross-examinationMaya: It is pretty strange, though, isn't it? I mean, nobody mentioned anything about a really large mirror. You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.Phoenix: Then the only logical explanation is... ...that there was no mirror inside Trés Bien that day. (Now I've just got to prove it... Somehow...)Phoenix: There is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony. Mr. Kudo broke the vase that was on the table where he was sitting. And yet! As the court can see, there is an unbroken vase on the table next to the victim! Why? Because Mr. Kudo was not, in fact, sitting at the table next to the victim at all!Godot:Godot: Don't be an idiot, Trite! That's impossible! That seat's the only one Kudo could've seen the victim's reflection from!Phoenix: Exactly!Godot: ...!Phoenix: There is only one conclusion we can draw from this contradiction. There was no mirror in Trés Bien that day! Your testimony, Mr. Armstrong, is an elaborate lie!Armstrong: Mon dieeeeeeeu!Godot:Godot: Don't try to confuse the court, Trite! Obviously, the witness cleaned up the vase... ...while the police were taking their time getting to the crime scene!Phoenix:Phoenix: Unfortunately, Mr. Godot, that doesn't quite work for me. Mr. Armstrong already testified to the contrary. In his own words... \"I did not touch anything else\" except the mirror!Godot: Ur... urgh! ... Gaaaaaaaaargh!Judge: Well, witness? What do you have to say for yourself?Armstrong: *sniffle*Phoenix: (I was right! There was no mirror in the restaurant that day!)Judge: In light of this revelation, we return back to the original problem. Why did the victim have an earpiece in an ear in which he couldn't hear?Godot: Ha...! You only get one shot in life. There's no turning back. If you want to claim that the mirror wasn't there, Trite... ...then this problem is all yours. How do you explain what the old man saw?Phoenix: (If I can answer this, then I'll be that much closer to the truth! I can feel it!)Maya: ...Are you going to be OK? Can you really solve this contradiction, Nick?Phoenix: There's more than just this one contradiction, Maya.Maya: What do you mean?Phoenix: Remember what Maggey told us? \"There was another man at the victim's table.\" And, \"there was a sample CD on the victim's table.\" It all flies in the face of Mr. Kudo's testimony. (And I think I know the reason why nothing in this case is adding up.)Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Let's hear your answer.Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. The reason behind all the contradictions in Mr. Kudo's testimony is simple.Mr. Kudo made a mistake. Phoenix: Clearly, Mr. Kudo made a mistake! Godot: Mr. Trite... You're the one who brought up all these contradictions. Phoenix: And...? Godot: If you're trying to tell us the old man just made a mistake... ...we can wrap up this case right now with a guilty verdict! Judge: How about it, Mr. Wright? Should I just declare your client guilty? Maya: Is that the best you can come up with, Nick? Phoenix: I-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake. Judge: I'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time! Leads back to: \"Yes, Your Honor.\"The ear doctor made a mistake. Phoenix: I believe we're looking at this the wrong way. It was actually the doctor's mistake. Judge: What? Phoenix: Yes. The doctor got the wrong ear! Godot: Godot: Well, I believe we saw an autopsy report yesterday. One that stated the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, and had medicine in it! Judge: I'm beginning to wonder if it's not your eardrum that's ruptured, Mr. Wright. Maya: This is no time to be playing with people's perceptions, Nick! Phoenix: I-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake. Judge: I'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time! Leads back to: \"Yes, Your Honor.\"The victim was a phony. Leads to: \"This case is riddled with contradictions.\"Phoenix: This case is riddled with contradictions. Yet, there is one very simple answer that clears them all up.Judge: A-And what is that?Phoenix: The incident Mr. Kudo witnessed, and the incident the victim experienced... ...were two completely different events!Godot: What!?Phoenix: Yes! The \"victim\" that Mr. Kudo saw wasn't Mr. Glen Elg at all! It was an imposter -- a phony pretending to be Mr. Elg! Obviously, unlike the victim, there was nothing wrong with the imposter's left eardrum. That's how he ended up wearing the earpiece in his left ear by mistake!Godot: Phwoooooooh!Judge: Order! Order in the court! Settle down, or I'll clear the courtroom!Godot: Quiet, gramps! Why don't you clear out of here, huh?Judge: WHAT DID YOU SAY!?Godot: Trite... Are you saying what Mr. Kudo saw was a set-up?Phoenix: Yes. Someone pretended to be Glen Elg and acted out the whole coffee poisoning. All for the express purpose of creating a \"witness\" out of one Mr. Victor Kudo!Godot:Godot: Get real, Trite! Why would anyone want to do that?Phoenix: Isn't it obvious? The thing Mr. Kudo was most insistent about in his testimony was...Kudo: The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge: I-It's so hard to believe, but...Phoenix: There was one, and only one reason to show Mr. Kudo this fake poisoning! To show Maggey Byrde in the act of poisoning the coffee!Godot:Godot: Are you insinuating that the waitress in the old man's story was a fake as well? It's true that there were no customers in the restaurant at the time, but... ...it's also true that the chef was there! He would have noticed what was happening.Judge: Th-That's right! Well, witness? If your restaurant really was the scene of such theatrics... ...you would have known about it, correct!?Armstrong: Oh là là... Z'is is most difficult for me...Phoenix:Phoenix: No, it's quite simple. All you have to do is testify. You are under oath, after all. Was there, in fact, a phony at Trés Bien that day!? The defense demands that Mr. Armstrong tell the whole truth about what happened.Judge: The defense's request for additional testimony is accepted. You will accurately explain, in detail, the events in the restaurant that day!Armstrong: Ou... Oui.Witness Testimony-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong: La victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone. I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im. Z'ere were no other customers. When 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited. It was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred. Non, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Judge: ...Just so we're clear, there was no mirror in the restaurant, after all?Armstrong: Je vous demande pardon! Forgive me, Your Honor! I lied because I wanted z'is mess to be cleared up quickly.Judge: What you have just done is commit perjury, Mr. Armstrong! I will decide how to punish you later.Armstrong: O-Oui...Judge: For now, we will hear your cross-examination. Mr. Wright, if you please. (Changed from [For now, we will hear your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)Phoenix: (Hmm.. He took that perjury charge a bit too well. But I'm guessing he'll be more serious trouble after this cross-examination!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong: La victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was he alone at his table as well? Armstrong: Mais, oui. I saw 'im from la kitchen. Phoenix: Yet the defendant, Ms. Byrde, remembers it differently. She swears there was another man at the victim's table. Godot: Godot: Ha...! Unfortunately for you, Trite... ...yesterday's witness also testified that the victim was alone. Phoenix: ...! Godot: You know, seeing you squirm like that reminds me... ...of a certain coffee's bitter-sweet bite. Phoenix: (What kind of coffee has he been drinking!?) Maya: It's not coffee, it's love! It's love that's bitter-sweet. Phoenix: (Hearing Maya say that makes her seem wise all of a sudden...)Armstrong: I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: By old man, you mean Victor Kudo, correct? Armstrong: Oui. 'E comes often for my special coffee. Godot: I drank your coffee once, Mr. Armstrong. It's special, I'll give you that. It's worth a sip just for the experience. Armstrong: Oh, you make me so 'appy, monsieur! You are most welcome any time! Godot: I said it was worth one sip, and nothing more. Phoenix: (So old Mr. Kudo arrived at the restaurant around the same time as the victim. Maybe I should ask about his arrival in more detail.) Don't ask anything. Phoenix: (All I need to do is establish that this phony victim really existed. Asking more about the old man is only going to cloud the issue.) I think that's enough about coffee. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Armstrong. Armstrong: You are welcome any time too, Monsieur Wright. I'll brew something special for you! Leads back to cross-examination How many minutes after? Phoenix: So you're saying that not much time elapsed between when the victim and Mr. Kudo arrived? Armstrong: Oui. Z'at is correct. Phoenix: (But that still leaves the possibility that something happened in that gap of time.) And by your recollection, how much time would you say elapsed? Armstrong: Let me see... Approximately 2 minutes, I would say. Phoenix: T-Two minutes!? That's all? Judge: Hmm... It seems unlikely that anything untoward could have happened in such a short time. Phoenix: (Rats! I knew I shouldn't have pursued this line of questioning...) Leads back to cross-examination What time is it? Phoenix: Out of curiosity, about what time was it when Mr. Kudo arrived? Armstrong: Oh, no... I cannot remember, monsieur. Judge: Hmm... I believe we were told by a witness yesterday... Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir. Judge: Does that perhaps jog your memory, witness? Armstrong: La incident 'appened about 20 minutes after 'e arrived. So the victim must 'ave arrived between 2:00 PM and 2:10 PM, non? Phoenix: (Hmm... Just after 2, huh...) Armstrong: Thank you for your 'elp, in jogging my memory, monsieur. You are wonderful! Judge: Hah hah hah! I can't sit here all the time and do nothing now, can I!? The time of day will be added to the witness's testimony. Armstrong: Oui, Monsieur Judge. Everything I do, I do it for you! Judge: Merci bien. That's French, isn't it? Hah hah hah! Phoenix: (I'm glad at least one person is in a good mood...) Maya: H-He's even humming a song to himself...! Changes statement from \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\" to \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.\"Armstrong: I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely sure about the time? Armstrong: When I think really 'ard, 1 am sure it was just after 2. Oui. It is la time I stop serving la lunch menu. Judge: Quite right. I always break for lunch when the restaurants are serving their specials. I've been known to wind up a case early just to make it on time! Hah hah! Phoenix: (I guess you should never get between a hungry judge and his lunch...) Judge: Oh, would you look at that! It's almost lunchtime already. Phoenix: Witness! Get on with your testimony, please!Present Millionaire Radio Flyer Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong: Z'ere were no other customers.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So your only customers were Mr. Kudo and the victim? Godot: Godot: How many times do you need to ask the same thing, Trite? You'd never catch me drinking the same blend twice! Phoenix: Huh? Godot: You're trying to establish the presence of a \"phony victim\" in the restaurant. But you're wasting your time. You can't grind bird seed to make coffee, if you catch my drift... Phoenix: (But there's a hole in this testimony somewhere! I'm sure of it!)Armstrong: When 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you see him? Armstrong: Non, I was in ze kitchen. But I 'eard 'im. I remember 'im shouting, \"Yes! 'Alf a million bucks!\" Godot: Presumably the defendant heard that too, then, correct? Armstrong: Maggey...? She looked like a poor little frightened dove! Phoenix: And what about Mr. Kudo? Armstrong: La old man chocked on some bird seed z'at got stuck in 'is throat. Judge: Hmm... It seems we now have yet another incident on our hands.Armstrong: It was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And what were you doing at that point? Without any customers, you must have had time to kill. Armstrong: I am multi-talented woman, monsieur! Phoenix: Sorry? What do you mean? Armstrong: Z'ere is la renowned chef, Jean Armstrong, and la tragic poet, Claurice Armstrong. Judge: C-C-Claurice...? Armstrong: Oui. I was writing a poem. An angry tale of a chef in 'alf a million dollars of debt... ...cooking for a man who won 'alf a million dollars on la lottery! It is called, \"Pourquoi\". It means, \"Why\". Per'aps I could recite it for la court? Phoenix: Please don't...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement) Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong: Non, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean you contacted the police as soon as the incident occurred? Armstrong: I asked la old man to call from la pay phone. Godot: By your own argument, Trite... ...the purpose of this \"phony victim's\" performance was so the old man would see it. In other words... ...once the incident occurred, this opportunity would completely disappear. Judge: Indeed. Armstrong: Bien. It seems la shadow of doubt 'as been lifted, n'est-ce pas? Phoenix: ...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement) Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Maya: I guess Mr. Armstrong is connected to this case, huh?Phoenix: Absolutely. Someone was impersonating Mr. Elg, and I refuse to believe he was oblivious. He was there the whole time, after all.Maya: But if you're right, wouldn't Maggey have noticed, too?Phoenix: She fell unconscious when the incident occurred, remember?Maya: Ah! You mean that's when the phony staged his act?Phoenix: We'll know for sure once I find a hole in this testimony.\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

    "cot": "Contradiction exists between Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 1 (Armstrong's \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\"), specifically regarding the presence of a vase on the table next to the victim. Armstrong testifies that the old man (Victor Kudo) arrived not long after the victim and sat at the table next to him, implying that Kudo saw the victim’s reflection in a mirror placed between the tables. However, the Crime Photo clearly shows an intact vase on the table next to the victim, contradicting Mr. Kudo's testimony that he broke that vase.\n\nThis contradiction indicates that Mr. Kudo was not actually sitting at the table next to the victim, calling into question the reliability of his testimony and suggesting that the mirror Armstrong claimed to be there (allowing Kudo to see the victim) was not present. This misalignment undermines Armstrong's claim about the mirror and Kudo’s observation, which is a key point in the case.\n",

This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. I-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me! Judge: The evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee. No! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me? Payne: Well... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!? Judge: This court finds the defendant... Guilty Judge: The court is adjourned. January 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Ahh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world! Phoenix: I bet it does, Maya. Maya: So! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think? Phoenix: Sure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake. Maya: Never! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game. ???: HEY, PAL! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... Maya: Happy New Year, Detective! Gumshoe: Uh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA... Maya: Here's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation! Gumshoe: Um... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO... Maya: Have you got a holiday present for me, Detective? Gumshoe: A what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but... Maya: Yay! Thanks! Gumshoe: LOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT! Maya: Hey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you? Gumshoe: Ah... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose? Maya: Ha ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year? Gumshoe: Very funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this! Phoenix: What is it? A magazine? Maya: Hey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\" Phoenix: Tr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!? Gumshoe: It's a report, pal. About you! Maya: Listen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\" Gumshoe: WELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it! Phoenix: But I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway? Gumshoe: Umm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month. Maya: Which makes it old news, you mean. Phoenix: But I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December! Maya: Hmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick? Gumshoe: If it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility... Maya: No way. You don't mean... Phoenix: A pho... Maya: A phony Nick!? Phoenix: (This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...) Magazine Clipping added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: SO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!? Phoenix: What do you mean, what am I going to do about it? Maya: Well, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case! Phoenix: My fault!? How do you figure that? Maya: Because THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of... Gumshoe: Yeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves? Phoenix: (But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...) Gumshoe: You better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it? Maya: Sounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto! Phoenix: I don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned. Maya: ... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year. Gumshoe: So you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!? Phoenix: (I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least pretend to read them once in a while. Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's sort of a keepsake... something to remember Mia by. Sure, the office is a mess, but I never forget to water this little fella. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so it's still super neat and tidy from when Pearls cleaned it. Movie poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I have to check it out one of these days. Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they bought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called \"Gatewater Land\". ...I wonder if that bellboy is going to send me a greeting card this year, too? Talk What to do Maya: So, what's our first move? Phoenix: I guess we go down to the detention center and talk-- Maya: Wait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right? Phoenix: Hey, hey! Let's get one thing straight. It wasn't me, it was a fake me that did this! Maya: Hmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean. Phoenix: (I hope not. *shudder* ...And what kind of name for an evil double is Xin Eohp anyway!?) Maya: Ah! Nick! I've got it! Phoenix: If you're going to ask whether I've got a twin brother, the answer is no. Maya: ...Spoilsport. Any ideas Maya: Did you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me? Phoenix: What do you mean? Maya: I mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess he was acting kind of strange. Maya: Maybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick! Phoenix: ... Considering how we interact, I seriously doubt that, Maya... Maya: Well, if he wasn't nervous because of you... Phoenix: ...then maybe it's because of our new guilty client? Present Attorney's Badge Maya: So you've still got that badge, I see. Phoenix: Huh!? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I? Maya: Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job. Phoenix: (...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.) Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe you've got an impersonator. Phoenix: I can't either. *sigh* Maya: Aww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people impersonating them! Phoenix: This isn't funny, Maya. It's not just an impersonation. This guy stole my identity! And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result. Maya: ...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick? Phoenix: (...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day. Phoenix: ...That's called \"taking a shower\". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it's because Maya's at a loss these days...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia helped me out in court again last time. Maya: It's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that. Phoenix: Yeah... Maya: We mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis... Phoenix: ...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don't we just have Pearls call her? Maya: No... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her. Phoenix: (I guess Maya's got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.) Godot profile Maya: So you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh? Phoenix: I already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much. Maya: Well he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter. Phoenix: You're just making that up, Maya! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: Digging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it? Phoenix: No. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him. Maya: Yeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears! Phoenix: (Did you mean he \"gets paid dirt\" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?) Any other evidence Phoenix: Do you know anything about this, Maya? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) Any other profile Phoenix: Do you know anything about this person? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everyone, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this individual. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: It's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick? Phoenix: Looks like Gumshoe isn't around. Maya: He's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work! Phoenix: No, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case. Maya: Guess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh? Phoenix: After being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Don't die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!\" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that's the key. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Desks Phoenix: These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks. Poster Phoenix: A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT! Mask☆DeMasque turned up at the bank? What's he doing!? \"Hands up, you scalawags!\" \"You're under arrest!\" Hey! That's our job! Phoenix: (Looks like Ron DeLite's opted for a new career.) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\", right Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Umm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: This is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...? Phoenix: K-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me! ???: Aaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying. Phoenix: A-Aren't... you... ???: Yes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down! Maya: Aah! You're... Are you...? ??? Don't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Maggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt-- Byrde: Oh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!? Maya: You better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick. Byrde: O-Oh... I see... Phoenix: So that's where we stand right now. Maya: I'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder... Byrde: My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures. Phoenix: (I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...) Byrde: But I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir! Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. I bet they don't get too many waitresses in here. He looks like he's getting a bit restless. Talk Maggey Byrde Maya: So, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform. Byrde: Hmph. I was fired after that... incident last year. Maya: Oh. I'm sorry. Byrde: It's OK. I don't mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on. Maya: So, what do you do now? Byrde: In the second act of \"The Life of Maggey Byrde\", I'm playing the role of a waitress! Maya: A waitress!? Byrde: Yes. In a French restaurant. It's a small place, but it's quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir. Phoenix: And then you got into this mess straight away, right? Byrde: Yeah, you could put it that way... What happened Byrde: This whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Trés Bien. Maya: \"Treh Bee-an\"...? Byrde: Yes. It's a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included! Maya: Oh... Byrde: There were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim's cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out. Maya: Hey, hold on there, Maggey. Byrde: What? Maya: You keep calling the guy, \"the victim\". Didn't you know the guy who was killed? Byrde: Not at all! I'd never even seen the guy before! Maya: Oh... Phoenix: (So she wouldn't have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right? Byrde: Of course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele. Phoenix: So, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come? Byrde: ......... You tell me, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ack! (Guess the answer to my question is \"my phony\"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.) Guilty verdict (appears after \"What happened\") Maya: So, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted? Byrde: Because no one else saw. Maya: Saw what? Byrde: The other man. The one who put the poison in the victim's coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. \"The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time.\" Phoenix: But how's that possible? Byrde: I don't know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could've done a better job! Phoenix: Look! That wasn't me, OK? Byrde: And then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket. Maya: What? Byrde: A small bottle... of poison. Maya: WHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!? Byrde: Well, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must've slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious. Phoenix: And no one else saw this other guy? Byrde: No, sir. That's what everyone said. But I don't see how they could've missed him... The other guy (appears after \"Guilty verdict\") Byrde: I was the one who took the coffee to the two men. Phoenix: O-Oh...? And what was your impression of them? Byrde: Well... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry. Maya: In music? How come? Byrde: Well, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician's look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Maya: An earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all? Byrde: It had a band's name written on it. I think it was \"MC\"-something. They must've been preparing for their debut, I guess. Phoenix: So it was a band's CD. Maybe a promo disc? Maya: Maybe it was \"MC Screwdriver\"! Phoenix: Get serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that? Byrde: Nngh... What was the name of that group again...? \"MC Hacksaw...\"? No... \"MC...\" Maya: And what about the killer? What did he look like? Byrde: Well, I, um... I don't really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really. Present Attorney's Badge Byrde: That badge! Is it real? Phoenix: Of course it's real! Byrde: That's what they all say. But I've been duped before. Give it to me for a sec! Phoenix: Ah...! ...*chomp!* Maya: She... She bit into it... Byrde: And I left a few teeth marks, too! Phoenix: I can see that... Byrde: I just wish I could remember if that means it's real or a fake. Phoenix: *sigh* (I said it was real!) Magazine Clipping Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I need to ask you about this... Byrde: Hey! This article's about my case! Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me? Byrde: Yes, sir! It was the morning after I'd been arrested... I met you in the visitor's room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits. Phoenix: Me? Byrde: Yes, you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Argh... Maya: Hey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too? Byrde: No. I don't remember a phony you, Maya. Maya: Oh... *sigh* It would've been so cool... Byrde: Then you got really worked up and passionate. \"I'm gonna get you' cleared'a dis crime!\" you said. (Changed from ['I'm gonna get you cleared of this crime!' you said.] in the original release) Phoenix: OK, I get the picture. But you've met me in person before... So how come you didn't realize that guy wasn't the real me? Byrde: ... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange... Phoenix: Only a little? Byrde: Well, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And... Phoenix: So the guy was nothing like me, then!? Byrde: But he had your spiky hair and blue suit. Phoenix: (... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?) Maya: How about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter? Byrde: Everyone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir. Maya: This case just keeps getting weirder and weirder... Maya Fey profile Byrde: Thanks for your help last year! Maya: Aw, it was nothing. I'm glad we got you off the hook. Byrde: I hope you can help me out this year, too! Maya: Yeah, me too. It's be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned. Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Oh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force! Phoenix: Have you seen him recently? Byrde: No. He's never been to the restaurant. Maya: Guess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all. Byrde: Yeah, he prefers the simple things in life. Phoenix: (...Or he's just simply too poor to afford anything else.) Maggey Byrde profile Byrde: No matter what happens, I never let anything get me down! Maya: You're always so positive, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! The early Byrde catches the worm! A Byrde in the hand! Maya: Wow! All those phrases are named after you? Byrde: And I never turn my back on anything! Maya: You're always so strong, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! I'm a tough old Byrde! Maya: \"Tough old byrde\", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it? Phoenix: ...Yeah, I get it. Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be on the police force, sir. But I'm incarcerated, now. So I can't use my connections to help you. All I can tell you about now is info about ex-cons or the clientele of Trés Bien, sir... Maya: Aww, don't let it get you down, Maggey! After clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping: Byrde: Mr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial? Phoenix: Probably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial. Byrde: Um... Mr. Wright...? Phoenix: ? Byrde: Do you think we'll win next time? ...Sir? Phoenix: ...! Byrde: My life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck! Maya: Argh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this! Phoenix: Wh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!) Maya: We'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you! Byrde: Thank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then! Phoenix: Trés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place. Byrde: Yes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi! Maya: Sure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food! January 6Trés Bien Maya: Wow! Look at this place. Phoenix: \"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right? Maya: Actually, I'm not all that into it... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here. Phoenix: Don't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here! Maya: Perfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want! Phoenix: (Yeah, I suppose we can...) Examine Cash register Maya: Look, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money. Phoenix: You know, you're the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way! Trinkets Maya: Look at all the little trinkets tucked away in here. Phoenix: I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let's see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups! Maya: ... I never knew you were so... cultured. Phoenix: Come on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much! Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? It'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then. Phoenix: Hm? There's something stuffed in behind the rack. Maya: ...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. \"MC Bomber\", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe? Phoenix: I wonder what \"MC Bomber\" is supposed to be...? ! (This paper! It's from December 3rd...) This paper's from the day of the poisoning! Maya: WHAT!? Sports Paper added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...) Magazine rack (subsequent times) Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Looks like Mr. Armstrong doesn't get any newspapers. Maya: Well, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it? Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" like in these mags, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Phoenix: (We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I'd better try to find out everything I can about it...) Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: What do you think this flower is, Nick? Phoenix: Let's see... Well, it doesn't look like a tulip, and it's not a sunflower, I don't think... Maya: Duh. Even I could've told you that. Phoenix: Well, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I'm a lawyer, not a botanist! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got you! I was only kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Crime scene Phoenix: This must be the table where the murder occurred. Maya: I guess so, with all this police tape all around it. Phoenix: And that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don't go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya? Maya: Why would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know! Phoenix: (Then why can I picture you doing just that?) Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Sports Paper Maya: Hmm... \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: There's something about that name, \"MC Bomber\". Phoenix: Yeah, It's a pretty unusual name. Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: Everyone's worried about bombs these days, I guess. Phoenix: I'm not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...) Maya: Anyway, we should really look into this some more! Maggey Byrde profile Maya: This is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then. Maya: Wasn't she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We're gonna get her off the hook or I'll give up hamburgers! Detention Center Present Sports Paper Byrde: Oh! A sports paper. Let's see, let's see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title? Phoenix: Sorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It's from the day of the murder... Maya: And Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid. Byrde: Oh, no... Phoenix: I found this paper in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Byrde: Really? That's strange... Trés Bien doesn't get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he's not really fond of them. Maya: Then maybe one of the customers left it behind? Phoenix: Anyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here. Byrde: Ah-ha! That's it, sir! \"MC Bomber\"! That was the name that was written on the CD! Phoenix: (Just as I thought...) Maya: I guess it wasn't \"MC Screwdriver\" after all, huh... Byrde: So, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right? Maya: If someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! \"The Master of Kurain\" or \"The Spirit Song\" or even \"Maya's Theme\"! Phoenix: Um, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim's table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim! Maya: You're right! Phoenix: (So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...) Maya: I think we better step up the investigation, don't you Nick? After presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 6Trés Bien ???: Oh là là! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Trés Bien! Maya: Oh! Hel... lo... ... Phoenix: (What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...) ???: Bienvenue! Welcome to my petite restauranté! Maya: Huh? \"Bee Avenue\"? ???: Oh, non, my petite chulip! Maya: Huh? Me? ???: Look at z'is face! Like la kitten rejected by its own mother. You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil mélange of la néroli and la rose. My personal recommendation! Maya: You think I need what...? ???: Oui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voilá! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique! Maya: Really? ???: And for la monsieur! Phoenix: Who? Me? ???: Look at z'at face! Like la puppy rejected by life itself! You are fatigued, non? For you, monsieur, I recommend z'is! Oil of bergamot. And maybe a 'int of... Oui, oui! I will add la peppermint and la clary sage for a fragrance exceptionnel! Such an invigorating recipe will bring out your delicious beauty, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My beauty!? ???: Alors. If you will be seated, I will bring you la special menu of z'e day! Phoenix: Actually, we're not here to eat. We're lawyers. ???: Mais bien sûr! I know z'is already, monsieur. You are la Phoenix Wright, non? Phoenix: Um, yes... You know me? ???: Mais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court! Maya: I guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp... Phoenix: It looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already. Maya: I wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you? Armstrong: Allow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté! Talk Trés Bien Maya: So what does \"Trés Bien\" mean? I know \"trés\". That means \"three\", right? Armstrong: Non, non, non! \"Trés Bien\" is Français! In English, you would say, \"Very Good\". Maya: Oh. Very good... Armstrong: Oui, exactement! La atmosphere is trés bien, and la cuisine is trés bien! Phoenix: (If the food's good, why aren't there any customers in here?) Armstrong: My cuisine is not for all. Some people, z'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine. Phoenix: (I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...) Armstrong: Since I 'ave lost Maggey, I do not 'ave enough 'ands. Phoenix: So, you're running this place on your own now? Armstrong: Oui. For la moment. No one 'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi! Phoenix: (... Please don't eyeball me while you say that.) Armstrong: I am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist. Maya: A roaming what? Armstrong: A practitioner d'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z'e delicate floral aromas. Phoenix: (Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...) What happened Phoenix: So, could you tell me what you know about the incident? Armstrong: Bien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z'an a month 'as passed since it 'appened. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess it's been about a month since Maggey's sentencing...) Armstrong: So. It was z'e third of last month. Just after one in z'e afternoon. A man who was in 'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill. Phoenix: Because of the poison in his coffee? Armstrong: Z'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took 'is drink to 'im. I was in la kitchen. I 'eard z'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, 'e was already slumped in 'is chair. Maya: He was dead? Armstrong: Mon dieu! Oui! 'E was dead! Maggey 'ad passed out also. Phoenix: And this man who died... Was he alone? Armstrong: Oui, monsieur. All alone. I know z'at Maggey said z'ere was someone else, but... Maya: I see... Armstrong: La police, z'ey asked me many times. \"Are you sure z'ere was no one else at z'e table?\" z'ey asked. But I am not z'e only one. La old man said z'e same thing. Phoenix: Old man? What old man? Old man (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Um... So who is the old man that you mentioned? Armstrong: At z'e time of la murder, z'ere was another customer in 'ere. Maya: What!? Someone else saw it? Armstrong: Mais, oui! As usual, 'e came alone z'at day. At z'e time of la murder, 'e was 'ere. 'E saw it, too. But 'e said z'e same thing, z'at z'ere was no one else at la victim's table. Maya: But Maggey swears there were two people! Armstrong: Mais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, 'e could not prove z'is, non? Phoenix: About the lawyer. That was me, I suppose? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr! Phoenix: ... Wow! He's the first person who's said it wasn't me. Maya: Don't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!? Maggey's motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile) Phoenix: When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen? Armstrong: Ou... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so. Phoenix: So what happened? Armstrong: Non. It was, er... It was nothing. Maya: Look, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive! Armstrong: Oui. It is true. Phoenix: If there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant. Maya: So please! Tell us anything you know. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock!?] in the original release) Maya: No way! What are we going to do, Nick? Phoenix: We'll just have to remov... WHAT THE!? Maya: Wh-What's wrong? Phoenix: The Magatama... It's gone! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: I had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air! Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (But I could see the Psyche-Locks. (Changed from [But I could see the Psyche-Lock.] in the original release) Maybe that means the Magatama's nearby...?) Maggey's motive (subsequent times) Phoenix: Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim. 3 PSYCHE LOCKS Armstrong: N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qué será, será. Perhaps Maggey 'ad another reason. Phoenix: (What's Maggey's motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock [sic] must mean it's nearby.) Maya: I only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK? Phoenix: (...And here I thought it was mine to keep!) Present Attorney's Badge Armstrong: Please, monsieur. Z'ere is no need to show me z'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z'e worst defense lawyer in town. Phoenix: (I think I can imagine how he formed this completely wrong impression of me...) Um, the last time we met, did I show you this badge? Armstrong: Oui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant! Maya: Looks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick! Magazine Clipping Armstrong: I am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z'at day was a little, how you say, \"lacking\", per'aps? Phoenix: *sigh* Armstrong: Even a Frenchman who cannot speak any English could 'ave done a better job! You were very cool, though. Oh, oui, oui! So 'andsome. Maya: Wow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been... Armstrong: Every time you opened your mouth, z'e 'ole courthouse stirred. Phoenix: (Oh, man. That is something I don't want to imagine...) Sports Paper Phoenix: We found this sports paper in the magazine rack here. Armstrong: One of my customers must 'ave left it behind. Maya: Do you have any idea which customer it was? Armstrong: Z'e only ideas I 'ave, mademoiselle, I save for my kitchen! Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: If you want a job 'ere, it is yours, precious! Mia Fey profile Armstrong: Mon dieu! What beauty! Maya: That's my sister! Armstrong: Ah, oui? Another delight! But you 'ave a certain je ne sais quois z'at I do not sense from your sister. Maya: I do? Armstrong: So throw your head 'ead 'igh! Thrust out your feminine features! Do not lose 'eart, ma fille! You are a woman! A woman extraordinaire! Maya: Do I look like I need cheering up or something? Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Maggey was a policewoman once, n'est-ce pas? Phoenix: Yes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control. Armstrong: Oui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non? Maya: Oh... You know about that? Armstrong: Z'at is why I gave to 'er la perfume for la 'appiness. Phoenix: Happiness perfume? Armstrong: Oui. Blended from bergamot, like I 'ave given to you before. Phoenix: But she's been arrested again. And found guilty this time. Armstrong: Z'is is true. 'Er natural aroma of un'appiness must 'ave been very strong. Phoenix: (Just admit it! Your perfume doesn't work!) Armstrong: I am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z'at took place before my very eyes. Maya: Something like what? Phoenix: (What's this guy talking about!?) Maya: Does this mean... Maggey did have a motive? Phoenix: We've got to ask this guy for more info, stat! Jean Armstrong profile Armstrong: It is 'ard to imagine, I know, but I was an apprentice for five years in la gay Paris. Maya: Wow! In Paris!? Armstrong: It was something la chef z'ere said to me z'at made me decide to open my own restaurant. Phoenix: What was it? Armstrong: Z'at awful man said to me, \"You must train for another ten years!\" Oh! It was such a shock! So unexpected! But you would 'ave to be a fool to do z'is, non? Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Armstrong: Félicitations! Mais... qu'est-ce que c'est? Phoenix: Ack! Um... Je... Je no comprehend... Maya: Nick! Don't just make something up! After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there? Armstrong: ... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves. Maya: Huh? \"'Im\"? Armstrong: La old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc. Phoenix: La p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that? Armstrong: Behind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\". Maya: Thank you! Armstrong: Je vous en prie, my dear! Maya: Let's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick! January 6Vitamin Square Maya: So this is Vitamin Square. Phoenix: Yeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you. Maya: Hey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about? Phoenix: That grouchy-looking grandpa? Maya: He's throwing seeds out for the pigeons. Phoenix: Maya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them! Old Man: ... Phoenix: (Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...) Examine Sandbox Maya: I used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe! Phoenix: Really? You? Maya: Sure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do. Phoenix: Iron filings? Wow... That's too exciting for words. Maya: It was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then! Phoenix: So, did you manage to get all the iron? Maya: No, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them? Phoenix: No. Fruit attractions Maya: This place is so fruity! Phoenix: That's not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They're among my favorites. Maya: Then that apple slide is perfect for you! Phoenix: ... And what is so \"perfect\" about it? Maya: Oh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo! Phoenix: No way! I'd get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that. Maya: Yeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too. Pigeons Maya: Hey, look. Pigeons! Phoenix: Yeah. And heaps of them, too. Maya: Did you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace? Phoenix: That's a dove, not a pigeon. Maya: ... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony? Phoenix: You're over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya. Magazine on orange-themed seat Maya: Ooh, there's a magazine here. Phoenix: It's a magazine full of job listings. Old Man: You disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away! Phoenix: \"Threw away\"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job? Old Man: Kah! That's none of your business! Phoenix: Sorry! I guess I'll take the magazine with me then. Old Man: I don't want anyone else having it! Give it back! Phoenix: (Too bad. Now that you want it so bad, I don't want to give it up!) Job Listings added to the Court Record. Old Man: Hey! That's mine! Closer orange-themed seat (after examining magazine on orange-themed seat) Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: You don't have to tell me twice. Talk What you saw Phoenix: Um... Excuse me. Old Man: ... Phoenix: Would you mind if I had a word with you? Old Man: Yes! Phoenix: I just want to ask you a couple of questions... Old Man: What's the matter with you!? Can't you see I'm busy? So you don't like my seeds, eh, pigeons!? Phoenix: (He's really chucking those seeds at them! That's got to hurt!) Old Man: Go on! Eat this! Phoenix: (*sigh*) Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Maya: Yes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Kah! It's a disgrace, I tell you. An utter disgrace! Maya: A disgrace? Old Man: An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: Revealing!? You mean her uniform? Old Man: The youth of today! They don't have any shame! No shame, I tell you! Not one ounce! Whatever happened to the old bushido values of Japan, like honor and modesty? Maya: What about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing. Old Man: You!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace! Maya: Talk about hitting a girl where it hurts... Trés Bien Phoenix: Do you go to Trés Bien a lot? Old Man: Hmph! That miserable excuse for a restaurant? That garbage they serve in there's not food. Where's the sushi? The tempura? The rice!? Phoenix: Trés Bien is a French restaurant, sir... Old Man: Where do you think we are, boy? In Paris!? I want real food, not those snooty snacks! And what about those shameless girls!? Phoenix: You mean the waitresses? Old Man: You can see all the way up to their... their... Yes! The waitresses! They're practically naked! It's a disgrace, isn't it? Well, isn't it!? Phoenix: Listen, it's not my restaurant. Old Man: Kah! It's a miserable excuse for a restaurant, that place! Miserable! Phoenix: (He certainly knows the place. He must be a regular! But if he hates it so much, why does he keep going?) Trés Bien regular (appears after \"Trés Bien\") Maya: Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir? Old Man: ... Maya: It's just, if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Maya: He must be hiding something, right? Phoenix: If he is, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock... Oh, wait... I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... Maya: Remember, Nick. That Magatama is only on loan. You better find it or else! Phoenix: (If Pearls ever gets wind of this, I'm going to be in a world of pain...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, excuse me, sir. Could I just ask you about this... Old Man: ... Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: Here you go, boy! How does some pigeon feed sound to you!? Phoenix: (This wasn't exactly what I was hoping to get out of this guy...) Detention Center Present Job Listings Maya: Um, Maggey... Byrde: Oh, are you looking for some part-time work, Maya? Why don't you take a job at the restaurant? I bet Mr. Armstrong would hire you. Maya: Really? Me? Byrde: It's pretty cool being a waitress, you know. And in the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets! Maya: What secrets...? Byrde: You can't make it obvious, but just spy on him for a bit. You'll see. It's interesting. Maya: Wow! I can't wait to get my apron on now! Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Oh, so you met the owner, Mr. Armstrong! Phoenix: He's, um... Oh, how can I put this... pretty unique, huh? Byrde: He has a really intense aura. As a chef and as a person. Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Trés Bien Examine Cash register (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's really tight behind the cash register counter. Can Mr. Armstrong even get in there? And if he got in... could he get out again? Trinkets (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: There's a bunch of little trinkets on a shelf by the door. I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Magazine rack (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Ugh. All the clothes in these are absolutely atrocious! ...Some of them have been circled in red. ... I really hope Mr. Armstrong is not thinking of buying those. Table (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong must be a pretty big neat-freak. He already has this table ready to go. Now if only the food in this place was edible... Windows (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It looks pretty cold out there on the streets. Peaceful, though. It's nice that people can take it easy after the holiday rush. Crime scene (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: This must be the table where the poisoning occurred. The stain tells the story well. The whole area is still cordoned off with police tape. I guess it must still be under investigation. Present Job Listings Armstrong: Mademoiselle! Maya: Y-Yes? Armstrong: Are you looking for la job? Maya: What!? N-No, no. I was just... Armstrong: Let me see. Your style is un peu différent, but you 'ave a good face. Maya: ...Different? Armstrong: Félicitations! You 'ave passed! I will 'ire you! Bien! Come wiz me. I will teach you everyz'ing I know! Maya: N-Nick! HEEEEEELP! Phoenix: (I don't know whether to laugh or feel bad for Maya... Maybe I should do both...?) Vitamin Square Examine Sandbox Phoenix: When I think back to when I was young... ...I wonder what I found so great about playing in a sandbox. Maybe I'll come back here in the middle of the night one of these days to relive it. ... On second thought, being arrested by Gumshoe would be too embarrassing to bear. Fruit attractions Phoenix: You don't see many parks like this anymore. What a great place for kids to play. But that old man's the only one here, chucking his seeds at the pigeons. Pigeons Phoenix: The pigeons are so busy pecking at the seeds, they don't notice anything else. Seeing those birds eat with such intense focus... ...reminds me of Maya when she's scarfing down a burger. Closer orange-themed seat Phoenix: This is where I found that job listings magazine before. A guy like me carrying around a magazine like that kind of gives the wrong impression. I guess I better give it back to that old man once this investigation's over. Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Yes, you do. You know, the waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Hmph! If you ask me It's a disgrace! Th-That's what it is! An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: So, you didn't like that kind of thing, then? Old Man: ... Wh-What are you trying to say about me, boy!? Explain yourself! Phoenix: Um, nothing! I'm not saying anything about you... Old Man: I know your kind! You young ones with your spiky hair and your fancy suits! That heads of yours is over-flowing with filthy ideas! Phoenix: (...I know someone who needs to learn some stress management.) Old Man: Get out of here, you young brat! Trés Bien regular Phoenix: So, you are a regular at that restaurant, right, sir? Old Man: ... Phoenix: You're always complaining about the place, so why do you go there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Phoenix: (Something's not right about this guy... But If he's hiding something, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock.) Oh, wait... (I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... I need to find it before I can get anywhere with this old man.) After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Looks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later. Examine Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. There's nothing for him to do right now, so he's catching some vertical z's. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Poor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Trés Bien once things have cooled off. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Well, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!? Phoenix: Um, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation. Gumshoe: Well, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's really fired up about this...) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor... Phoenix: (Oh. ... Him.) Gumshoe: Now, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again... Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Gumshoe: Um... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!? Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Hitting the gas is like hitting the fast-forward button on your life.\" No. That's too obscure. You don't really get the \"you'll die before your time\" idea. I need something more direct. Something a bit more light-hearted. Something like, \"Hitting the gas is your passport to paradise!\" Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT!? Poisoned coffee waitress gets a retrial!? I knew it! I knew there was something funny about the taste of this coffee! OK! Who brought me this coffee today? Hands up! Phoenix: (Yeesh! Have a little faith in your subordinates!) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Phoenix: No matter what, whenever I come here, that mascot's there to greet me. Chief: You got that right. That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Phoenix: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're married. Phoenix: (So should I expect to see Baby Badger next time I'm here...?) Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: So the guilty party was Maggey Byrde, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah... Phoenix: Back when she was on the police force... ...you were her mentor when she was a rookie, right? Gumshoe: Yeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened. Phoenix: (Gumshoe sure is sweating up a storm over nothing... ...Ah, so that's it! Our big ol' Gumshoe has a little ol' crush on Maggey!) Gumshoe: I... I don't like her or anything! I... I was... Aaaargh! Phoenix: (Note to self: Gossip with Maya about this later!) Gumshoe: Look, pal! Don't tell anyone, OK!? You've gotta keep it a secret, got it!? Phoenix: S-Sure... And would you mind not guessing what I'm thinking all the time? Gumshoe: Hey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind. The victim Phoenix: So I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim? Gumshoe: Glen Elg, he was a computer programmer. Phoenix: I see. A programmer... Gumshoe: He was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal. Phoenix: (Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often? Gumshoe: Not according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy. Phoenix: (A programmer... and a first-time customer at that...) (Changed from [A programmer... and a first-time customer...] in the original release) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that? Gumshoe: That's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial. Phoenix: You're kidding! What was her supposed \"motive\"? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK? Phoenix: (What could this motive have been...?) The investigation Gumshoe: This isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself. Phoenix: O-Oh, that's right... Gumshoe: The judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony. Phoenix: Yeah... Doesn't sound very good for us, huh? Gumshoe: Look, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop. Phoenix: (That's not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony? Contradictions (appears after \"The investigation\") Gumshoe: The biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table. Phoenix: Yeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim. Gumshoe: Right. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD... Phoenix: (CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...) Byrde: And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Gumshoe: But our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD. Phoenix: What? Gumshoe: Not on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal. Phoenix: But didn't Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too? Gumshoe: Yeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie. Phoenix: A radio? He didn't have a CD player? Gumshoe: You got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all. Phoenix: (Come to think of it... The owner of Trés Bien didn't mention that CD either. I don't know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong's got something to hide...) The charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile) Phoenix: So what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Trés Bien? Gumshoe: It's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected with the case anyway... Phoenix: Hey, come on, Detective. Didn't you say you'd give me the dirt on anything? Gumshoe: Well, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stuff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK? Phoenix: Um... Don't suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Trés Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.) Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? (I've got to track this creep down!) Magazine Clipping Gumshoe: I wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was. Phoenix: And what did he say? Gumshoe: He started off by saying, \"I'm at a complete loss for words...\" But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour. Phoenix: But... Gumshoe: He said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty! Phoenix: (It looked like I was \"trying to get Maggey found guilty\"...?) Sports Paper Gumshoe: What's that? A sports paper? Phoenix: Yeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Gumshoe: It's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here. Phoenix: And take a look at this. See this writing here? Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... Hey! Phoenix: What is it? Gumshoe: I've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Gumshoe: Hey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble. Phoenix: (Handwriting, huh? It'd be good to know more about that, in any case...) Gumshoe: Thanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue! Sports Paper given to Detective Gumshoe. Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: Hey! So how come she's not with you today? Phoenix: She's working down at the restaurant right now. Gumshoe: Working, huh? Yeah, it's tough being broke. I would know. Phoenix: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: Next time I see her, I'll show her how to make the world's best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It's the only way! Phoenix: (Um... Why is he shaking my hand with such enthusiasm...?) Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Phoenix: What? Mia did? Gumshoe: Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Godot profile Gumshoe: That's the guy who's gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey's retrial tomorrow. Phoenix: O-Oh, really? Gumshoe: He was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal. Phoenix: (Why's that guy so determined to see me fail?) Gumshoe: You sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind. Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything. Phoenix: It's OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right. Gumshoe: ... You know what? You're not such a bad guy after all, pal. Maggey Byrde profile Phoenix: Have you gone to see Maggey? Gumshoe: Of course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words. Phoenix: Oh... Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to. Phoenix: (Did he go for her, or for himself...?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: The chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Phoenix: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day. Phoenix: Under orders? Old Man: Yeah. You know, there's something about the lady... I mean, guy. Phoenix: Huh!? You can't stop thinking about him!? Gumshoe: Not like that, pal! Gimme a break! He's not my type. I mean, I can't stop thinking that he's involved with this case somehow! Phoenix: (Sounds like he knows a little something more about our charming chef.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you make of this...? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant... Phoenix: (You don't have to explain... Really...) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.: January 6Trés Bien Phoenix: The scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...) ???: Ah! Welcome! Bee avenue! Phoenix: (Wow. What a cute voice.) Maya: Oh, it's just you, Nick. Phoenix: M-Maya! Maya: Well? How do I look? Phoenix: ... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium... Maya: Maybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer. Phoenix: (Then who was that woman I just saw?) Maya: Oh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat! Phoenix: ... I am kind of hungry, actually. Talk Waitress Phoenix: So, how do you like your new job, Maya? Maya: I never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people's orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that. Phoenix: Yeah, it's a nice-looking restaurant. It's a shame more people don't come. Maya: Don't forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my \"gimme a tip\" smile! Lunch special Maya: Hey, Nick! Why don't you order something? The chef's preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says. Phoenix: How much is it? Maya: It's the Twin-T set. So it's 20 dollars, of course. Phoenix: The Twin-T set? I believe I'll be taking a pass. It's kind of expensive. Maya: What!? But you can't! Come on, Nick! It's not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register! Phoenix: How about cleaning the toilets? That should keep you busy. Maya: Yeah, right! Maybe later. Present Anything Phoenix: About this... Maya: Sorry, Nick! I'm a waitress now. I've got a pile of work waiting for little ol' me. After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um... About the lunch... Maya: Oh! A fine choice, sir. Phoenix: No. I, um... Maya: KITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT! Phoenix: I don't need any of that! Maya: Just a moment, please, sir. Phoenix: (Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya! Maya: Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set! Phoenix: Whoa! Maya: A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit! Phoenix: Um, thanks...? Maya: Come on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already! Phoenix: (Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp! Maya: Well? Phoenix: Are you hungry, Maya? Maya: I'm starving! Phoenix: Here. It's yours. Maya: Really!? ... Urp! Phoenix: Remember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate! Maya: ... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets! Phoenix: Hey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!) Trés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record. Phoenix: How does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad? Maya: Hey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen? Phoenix: (The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.) Talk Kitchen Phoenix: Hmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? \"In the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!\" Maya: In the kitchen? Mmm. That sounds tasty! Phoenix: Hey, wait up! Maya! Maya: What is it? I'm pretty busy right now. Phoenix: Weren't you going to show me around? Maya: Tsk. There goes my plan to find some cool clue and show it off in your face... Phoenix: (I'd better conduct the search in the kitchen myself!) After clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Trés Bien: January 6Trés BienKitchen Maya: And here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually. Phoenix: ... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure. Maya: Mr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop! Examine Mirror Maya: Now THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty. Phoenix: There's a book on the dresser. \"Claurice Armstrong's Bedtime Literature\". Maya: Not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it? Phoenix: It looks like a collection of poems he's written. Maya: Poems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK? Phoenix: OK, um... Here's one. Ahem! It's called, \"Printemps\". \"Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must.\" Maya: Huh? That's it!? Phoenix: Yup. That's a poem for you. Oil bottles Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: There's one bottle that's different from all the others. Phoenix: Well what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either. Maya: And... *sniff* It doesn't smell. Phoenix: (So what's that liquid inside then, I wonder?) Maya: Hey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he? Small Bottle added to the Court Record. Oil bottles (subsequent times) Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Lace curtains Phoenix: What are these lace curtains for? Maya: I don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those. Phoenix: (How do you respond to something like that!?) Table Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter! Maya: My Magatama! What's it doing there!? Phoenix: (What indeed...) Magatama put into pocket. Table (subsequent times) Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Maya: And look at these knives. They look really sharp! Phoenix: I'd like to see how one of those slices through a cheesecake. Maya: A cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick. Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I just ate for lunch? Maya: Maybe... What you ate is the only French dish I know the name of. After examining oil bottles in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Hey, you're just in time! Phoenix: What is it, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: The lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me. Phoenix: (He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything? Gumshoe: They said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it. Phoenix: (I expected as much...) Gumshoe: The victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment. Sports Paper refiled into the Court Record. Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal? Phoenix: (Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...) Talk Armstrong's secret (appears after presenting Small Bottle) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes... Gumshoe: So, how was it? Phoenix: To put it nicely... it was inedible. Gumshoe: Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so... Phoenix: Yeah... I guess it's probably the food. Gumshoe: The real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt. Phoenix: Really? How much does he owe? Gumshoe: This is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red. Phoenix: H-Half a million? Are we talking dollars? Gumshoe: Yeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble! Phoenix: Sorry. That figure just took me by surprise. Gumshoe: Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch. Jean's Loan Contract added to the Court Record. Armstrong's secret (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes... Gumshoe: So, how was it? Phoenix: To put it nicely... it was inedible. Gumshoe: Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so... Phoenix: Yeah...

That figure just took me by surprise. Gumshoe: Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch. Present Sports Paper Gumshoe: So according to the boys down at the lab, the doodles were probably made by the victim. Phoenix: Probably? Gumshoe: Analyzing this kind of writing is difficult since it's done with a fiber-tipped pen. But don't worry! I'll vouch for it. Phoenix: (Why would Gumshoe have to vouch for it? Can't it stand on its own?) Small Bottle Gumshoe: You got one of those aroma bottles too, huh? Phoenix: Only this one doesn't smell. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get you... Phoenix: This was mixed in with all the other aromatherapy bottles, but it's not the same. It doesn't even look the same, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: A cologne bottle that doesn't smell, huh? Smells like a skunk to me, pal! Mind letting me borrow that bottle for a while? I wanna send it to the lab for analysis. Phoenix: (The victim was poisoned, so the contents of this bottle are pretty important...) Small Bottle given to Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: I had a lunch there was something funny about that chef. Phoenix: You suspect Jean Armstrong? Gumshoe: I've got that guy's number. I know what his secret is. Phoenix: (That must be the same secret Gumshoe was talking about before.) Gumshoe: I guess I'd better fill you in on the details. About this Armstrong guy's secret, I mean... Jean's Loan Contract Gumshoe: It's for half a million dollars, pal! That's... um... half a million dollar bills! Phoenix: (What was the \"um\" in there for!?) Is there really that much money tied up in this case? Gumshoe: I can't give you an answer on that, pal. Not without the case file in front of me. But I'll tell you this... That Armstrong guy would've done anything for cash. He was desperate, you know? Phoenix: No, I don't. But I think I sort of get the picture. After examining table in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Vitamin Square Phoenix: Hmm, the old guy's not here anymore. (Drat. And I still have some unanswered questions for him.) Examine Motor scooter Leads to: \"A scooter, huh?\" Phoenix: A scooter, huh? Who'd leave it right in the middle of the park like this? The wheel guard and the light are busted... I guess it must have been in an accident. It's totally wrecked. ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!

Surely that guy wasn't my phony... was he...? ... He wasn't anything like me!! (Guess I better make a note of the scooter...) Scooter added to the Court Record. ???: Kah! Pathetic! Phoenix: Oh, it's you. Old Man: A few threats from a little brat like that... ...and you look like a pigeon that's got seeds in its eyes. Phoenix: Have you been here the whole time then? Old Man: I was in that strawberry. I had some thinking to do. Phoenix: (More like you had some cowering to do!) Talk Trés Bien regular Phoenix: Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir? Old Man: ... Phoenix: It's just if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha!

Trés Bien regular (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Why are you a regular at a restaurant that you clearly hate, sir? Old Man: Take that, pigeons! See how you like these seeds! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (It's no good. I'm gonna have to break his Psyche-Lock. I just can't figure out what he would be hiding. I mean, I'm only asking him why he goes to a particular restaurant.) Trés Bien regular (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Um... Sir... Old Man: Yes, it's true! I was there for the young girl. Fine, so I'm a dirty, wicked, sinful old devil! Phoenix: No, no... I didn't mean it like that... Old Man: I even get one of those lousy cups of javaccino every time. For 8 dollars! All because of the serving girl! Punish me! Lock me up! Phoenix: Really, that's not what I'm here for. Old Man: You'll be the same! Another 20 years and you'll understand what it's like! You'll know how painful it is to be an old man like me! Phoenix: No, really. Listen, sir... Old Man: Stop calling me that! I have a name you know, boy! So show some respect, hmm!? I'm Victor Kudo.

Present Magatama (after clearing \"Trés Bien regular\" Talk option) Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Trés Bien regular -- Phoenix: It's time you told me the truth. Why are you a regular at a restaurant that you dislike so much? Old Man: Isn't it obvious!? People only have one reason to go to restaurants. To eat! Phoenix: To eat? Is that the whole truth? Old Man: Wh-What do you mean!? Phoenix: I don't think you go to that restaurant for the food at all. Old Man: You insolent brat! How dare you accuse me! What proof have you got!?

I haven't done a jot of work since I was born. Other than feeding the pigeons. Phoenix: (What a load of crock!) Old Man: The taste's another story, but the price... It's nothing to me. Phoenix: So, you're saying that you go there because you've got money to burn? Old Man: Exactly! I have so much cash, I go for a swim in my money vault every day!

I just go for the javaccino. Phoenix: Yeah... I think you mean a cappuccino. Anyway, how much does a cappuccino cost there? Old Man: Eight dollars. Phoenix: (Those had better be some golden beans!) Old Man: What's your problem? You think a poor man would be better off drinking dishwater, do you? Is that it!? Phoenix: N-No. I wasn't thinking that. I was wondering if the coffee there is really that great... Old Man: No, it's not. But... But anyway! Yes! That place has free newspapers to read every day. Phoenix: Newspapers? Old Man: Exactly.

Leads back to: \"Tell me, why are you so determined to hide the truth?\" Old Man: Wh-What are you asking me about that girl for? Phoenix: She was the waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Ah! Phoenix: Therefore, the answer to the mystery... ...of why an old man would drink expensive coffee at a terrible restaurant... ...is the waitress! Old Man: Argh! B-But I don't recognize that face! Phoenix: And you are probably telling the truth here. Because you weren't looking at the girl's face... But at her outfit! Old Man: *gulp* Phoenix: That's the truth, isn't it? You became a regular at the restaurant because of the waitress's uniform! That uniform is all you can think about, isn't it? Old Man: Uh... uh... I-I can't take it...

The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now. Maya: I hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake. Judge: I see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case? Gumshoe: Y-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report. Judge: The court accepts this into evidence. Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Um... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress. Judge: The waitress being the accused? Gumshoe: Yeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo. Judge: Hmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me. Trés Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record. Godot: Come, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands. Judge: Now then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony. Gumshoe: Umm... Yes, sir... Witness Testimony -- The Incident -- Gumshoe: When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir. We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time. Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup. And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch! And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive. Judge: Hmm... Godot: Using the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady! Judge: The facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but... Phoenix: Yes? Judge: Please, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood? Phoenix: I already told you! That wasn't me! Cross Examination -- The Incident -- Gumshoe: When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Can I stop you for just a minute? Gumshoe: Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence? Phoenix: (He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's what she said. And I-- Godot: Godot: What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction? Phoenix: Hey! Godot: Sadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Well, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way. Godot: Ha...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Trés Bien, Trite! Phoenix: ...! Godot: I have here in my possession a ticket. Phoenix: A ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.) Godot: Yes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen. Judge: This is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct? Godot: I think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table? Phoenix: Urk! Judge: It certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Can I stop you for just a minute? Gumshoe: Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence? Phoenix: (He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's what she said. And I-- Godot: Godot: What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction? Phoenix: Hey! Godot: Sadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table. Judge: Hmm... Gumshoe: We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He was listening to his radio, you say? Gumshoe: Yeah. He had a portable radio in his chest pocket. Maya: Maggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\". Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: And what was it that the victim was listening to on the radio, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Huh? How should I know? Phoenix: (Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.) Maya: This isn't going very well, is it...? Judge: Hmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used? Leads back to cross-examination Gumshoe: Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else? Gumshoe: Not sure I get you, pal. Phoenix: Was the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder? Gumshoe: If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance. Phoenix: So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper... Godot: Godot: Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite? Gumshoe: The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: It seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee? Gumshoe: Huh!? What do you mean? Phoenix: According to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!? Gumshoe: Oh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think-- Godot: Godot: In case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there. Gumshoe: Huh? For me? Godot: \"Oh, hey! You're right!\"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence. Gumshoe: Th... THAT piece... sir? Godot: Yes. THAT piece. Gumshoe: ... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again? Godot: This! Phoenix: (Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?) Gumshoe: Oh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup. Godot: Yes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim. Judge: Oh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it. Godot: Conclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this! Phoenix: Uuuurgh! Gumshoe: For the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's. Coffee Cup added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Upon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance... Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else? Gumshoe: Not sure I get you, pal. Phoenix: Was the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder? Gumshoe: If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance. Phoenix: So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper... Godot: Godot: Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite? Gumshoe: The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: It seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee. Gumshoe: And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: (Potassium cyanide? I've heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: It's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history. Maya: How much is too much? Godot: A lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off. Maya: 0.2 grams? How much is that? Gumshoe: You know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much. Phoenix: (Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...) Judge: Hmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere. Gumshoe: And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Some kind of a motive\"? Gumshoe: Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion. Godot: Godot: You know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get it. Godot: I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out. Gumshoe: *gulp* Godot: So stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive? Phoenix: (Come on, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: She was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket. Phoenix: I knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.) Gumshoe: It disappeared from the scene of the crime. Godot: And it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million! Maya: Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one... Phoenix: (Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Wait a minute! The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client! Godot: Ha...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question! Judge: Th-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...? Gumshoe: One of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant. Phoenix: WH-WHAAAAAT!? Judge: Order! Order! Godot: Ha...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress. Judge: Y-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately! Phoenix: (Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...) Victim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record. Judge: The ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...? Godot: It's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor. Phoenix: (And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey's person...] in the original release) Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Victim's Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Some kind of a motive\"? Gumshoe: Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion. Godot: Godot: You know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get it. Godot: I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out. Gumshoe: *gulp* Godot: So stick to the facts, Detective.

Gumshoe: It disappeared from the scene of the crime. Godot: And it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million! Maya: Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one... Phoenix: (Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?) Maya: You really think there are any contradictions in this testimony? Phoenix: To be honest, I don't know. Maya: But Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line? Phoenix: (I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.) After selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements: Judge: That's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime. Godot: I like an old man who knows the score. Judge: There is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules! Godot: I don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money. Maya: Not good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast. Phoenix: Yeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already. Godot: I'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence. Phoenix: (He's got more evidence against Maggey!?) Godot: This is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time. Maya: Wow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen... Phoenix: Th-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?) Godot: Ha...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself. Phoenix: The coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye... Godot: Of course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more. Judge: Something else? I presume you mean... Godot: Of course. I'm referring to the pocket. Phoenix: The... pocket? Godot: A search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket! Phoenix: A bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket? Gumshoe: Yeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it. Phoenix: WHAAAT!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence. Apron added to the Court Record. Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record. Judge: There's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court? Godot: Bloodstain? What bloodstain would that be? Judge: Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron! Godot: That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain! Phoenix: (You don't need to be told! Just look at it!) Godot: Well, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!? Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir. Phoenix: Ketchup!? Gumshoe: She must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day. Judge: ... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe! Godot: Pull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness! Gumshoe: Unnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already. Judge: Hmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case. Phoenix: ...! Judge: The motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established. Godot: Well, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all. Phoenix: (Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!) Judge: Witness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there. Witness Testimony -- The Investigation -- Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir. Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her. The victim didn't have any identification on him. But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly. When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison. And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene. Judge: Hmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good. Godot: Last chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite! Phoenix: ...! Godot: Don't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin! Cross Examination -- The Investigation -- Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Scary old man\", Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: There's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened. Phoenix: (Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...) Gumshoe: Officers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. \"What took you so long!?\" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds... Judge: Hmm... Seeds... Godot: Ha...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth. Phoenix: (I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...) Godot: The old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime. Gumshoe: Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How long was the defendant unconscious for? Gumshoe: The officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself. Phoenix: (I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...) Gumshoe: I woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful. Phoenix: (You're a professional detective, Gumshoe. Not a professional bird watcher!) Godot: Save the romantics for your own time, Detective. All we need to know about is the investigation. Gumshoe: Oops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I? Gumshoe: The victim didn't have any identification on him. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then? Gumshoe: No, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet. Phoenix: Fifty-eight cents...? Gumshoe: Yeah. I can't believe I found someone with less in their wallet than me, pal! Judge: The victim sounds like he was a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... Why not give him a bit of an edge? Phoenix: (I think I'm on to something here...) Gumshoe: But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...) Gumshoe: There was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket. Godot: It seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Trés Bien. Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?) Leave it Phoenix: (I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the prescription bag Phoenix: So what sort of medicine was in the bag? Gumshoe: Well... Actually, the bag we found was empty. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Yeah. Completely empty. Phoenix: (It was completely empty...?) Victim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record. Godot: Ha...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence? Desperate, are you, Trite? Phoenix: ...! Godot: Now, what happened with the investigation after that, Detective? Leads back to cross-examination Ask about his health insurance Phoenix: So, the victim had no form of identification on him, correct? Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: And yet, before arriving at the restaurant, he went to see a doctor. Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him! Judge: Oh! That is very true! Phoenix: The fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen! Godot: Ha...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with! Phoenix: Huh? Judge: Hmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... A bit of an edge never hurt anyone. Maya: Looks like we're off course again, Nick. Judge: Witness. Please continue with your testimony. Explain for the court the events following the preliminary investigation. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Victim's Prescription Bag is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...)

Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court. Gumshoe: When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But the defendant had been passed out for a while, correct? In that case... Isn't it possible someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket!? Gumshoe: Hey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal! Judge: Hmm... Gumshoe: It happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes! Godot: Godot: Keep up this crazy testimony, Detective, and those shoes will end up down your throat! Gumshoe: Sorry... Godot: So, Trite. \"Someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket\"...? That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence? Phoenix: Um... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...) Judge: It appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness. Gumshoe: And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for. Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: Interesting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh? Phoenix: (And they're just going to let him get away with it...?) Judge: It was just one dollar, Detective. Maya: I guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe. Present Victim's Prescription Bag Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you.\" Phoenix: If I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict! Maya: Gumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something! Phoenix: Yeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious. Maya: Come on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony. Gumshoe: Oho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you? Phoenix: You testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later? Gumshoe: Um, no. They didn't. Phoenix: The victim was given a prescription right before going to Trés Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!? Gumshoe: Y-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!! Judge: I-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!? Gumshoe: I, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh? Phoenix: The victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself! Judge: O-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that? Godot: Ha...! That's all. Phoenix: What!? Godot: Read for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will. Phoenix: What's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological? Judge: Just what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot? Godot: Hardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say. Judge: A war wound? Godot: The day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum. Phoenix: He ruptured his eardrum!? Judge: Then what on earth was the prescription he was given? Godot: It was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested! Phoenix: What!? Godot: It's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear. Judge: Yes. Here it is. In very, very fine print. Godot: It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication. Phoenix: Uuurgh... Judge: It seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all. Phoenix: N-No... Maya: Nick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over! Phoenix: (She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?) Push the medication issue Leads to: \"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\" Leave it Phoenix: It does seem as it the medication isn't connected to the case. Godot: Ha...! Maybe the last Mr. Trite was the real one. At least he didn't waste time. Judge: Indeed... If you have nothing further to add to this medication issue... ...the facts of this case seem no different to those presented on the last trial. I would therefore have no choice but to hand down my verdict. Phoenix: Uh... Umm...! Maya: Nick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground! Judge: Now then... Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Your Honor! Actually, this prescription... is absolutely pivotal to the case! Judge: Mr. Wright! Did you not just say the exact opposite only moments ago!? Phoenix: (Gotta lose a few battles in order to win the war, I suppose.) Leads to: \"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\" Phoenix: Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!? Godot: ...! Judge: But the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal! Phoenix: Phoenix: That doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth! Godot: Godot: You know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide. Phoenix: Phoenix: It hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable! Godot: Aaargh! Judge: That's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call? Godot: ... Judge: Mr. Godot...? Godot: ... Gumshoe: Um... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder. Phoenix: (Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?) Judge: Very well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me. Maya: Yay! Good job, Nick! Judge: The court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness. Godot: Ha...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups. Judge: Court is adjourned for recess! January 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Maya: Phew! That was close! Phoenix: Tell me about it... I nearly died in there! Byrde: That's my line, sir! Maya: No! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit. Byrde: Looks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!? Maya: Huh? Byrde: He said he'd help me. But he totally set me up! Phoenix: I don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right? Byrde: It's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again! Phoenix: (Poor Gumshoe...) Maya: So the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right? Phoenix: Yeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds! Byrde: I bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know? Maya: Yeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds! January 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: Court will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please. Godot: The prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand. Godot: Name and occupation, if you don't mind. Kudo: The name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too. Phoenix: We don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation. Kudo: My occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!? Phoenix: Kimono embroidery? Kudo: That's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed! Maya: Wow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime. Kudo: Anyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile! Phoenix: (That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...) Judge: Now then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident? Kudo: Oh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino. Judge: Seeds? Kudo: What do you think these are, hmm!? Judge: I-I see... Godot: So you saw everything that happened, gramps? Kudo: Did I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all! Godot: Then please, tell the court. We're all ears. Kudo: Sure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail! Phoenix: (He's really getting into this...) Witness Testimony -- What I Witnessed -- Kudo: The young man was reading the sports paper. The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed. That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well! Judge: Mr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress. Kudo: Kah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!? Judge: N-Newfangled? Kudo: All this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you! Judge: E-Excuse me... Kudo: Listen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away! Judge: Well, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Cross Examination -- What I Witnessed -- Kudo: The young man was reading the sports paper. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you saw the victim, then? You saw Mr. Glen Elg? Kudo: I wanted to know if Gusten Brawn retained his championship or not. Phoenix: (So he was looking at the sports paper the victim was reading, huh...) And at the location in question... ...there are partitions between tables on the same side of the restaurant, right? Kudo: So what if there are? Phoenix: If you say that you could see the victim... ...that means you were sitting at a table on the other side of the restaurant, correct? Kudo: Kah! I go to that place to drink javaccino! I don't go to sit! I don't remember what table I was sitting at! Phoenix: (You mean you go there to eye the waitress!) Kudo: The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw? Kudo: Victor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i! Phoenix: I see... Kudo: My eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving. Phoenix: (...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.) Kudo: And I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well! Phoenix: (I bet I know what's coming up and something tells me I'm not going to like it...) Leave it Phoenix: (It'd be dangerous to press this too much. I'd better ignore it for now.) So, what happened next? Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Your Honor. We need more clarification on what was put into the victim's coffee. I'd like to ask that the witness add what he knows about this to his testimony. Judge: Hmm... I agree. Witness, will you enlighten us, please? Kudo: Sure, sure. Adds statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\" Press (after adding statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw? Kudo: Victor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i! Phoenix: I see... Kudo: My eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving. Phoenix: (...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.) Kudo: And I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well! Kudo: There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: D-Did she really put that into the coffee? Kudo: You doubt me, boy!? She too some out of a small, brown bottle and sprinkled it in. Phoenix: Couldn't she have been adding sugar? Kudo: Sugar!? In a small, brown bottle like that!? Judge: \"Like that\"? Witness, could you please describe the bottle in more concrete terms? Godot: Ha...! A bottle like this, perhaps? Kudo: Oh, there it is! That's the one! Judge: That's the bottle of potassium cyanide, I presume? Godot: So what did the accused put into the coffee? I think it's clear, don't you? Phoenix: Argh... Kudo: The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He took just one sip? Kudo: You young'uns! You waste everything! Those javaccinos cost 8 dollars! In the good old days, we would have drank every last drop, eaten the cup, and then died! Phoenix: (Congratulations. You have earned the title of Battiest Man To Grace A Courtroom.) Godot: So it was an immediate death? Well, with potassium cyanide, I suppose that is possible. Kudo: Oh, yes. He slumped over without so much as a twitch! I felt the javaccino I'd just drank turn sour in my stomach. Godot: Oh, yes. I know that feeling. Judge: And the waitress? I presume she is...? Kudo: That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by? Kudo: Particular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is! Phoenix: Sorry? Kudo: You can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform! Phoenix: Phoenix: So the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me! Judge: Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image. Maya: Don't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together! Phoenix: (I-I guess I got a bit carried away...) Kudo: Kah! There are other things I recognize about her, too. Phoenix: (He seems pretty sure of himself. What should I do?) Leave it Phoenix: (There's got to be a better line of attack than this. That's what I should be looking for now...) Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Sure, you saw a waitress take the coffee over to the victim. But what matters is whether that waitress was Maggey Byrde or not. Judge: Quite right. Mr. Kudo. These other \"features\" that you recognize about the defendant... I would ask you to add them to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Adds statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\" Press (after adding statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by? Kudo: Particular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is! Phoenix: Sorry? Kudo: You can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform! Phoenix: Phoenix: So the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me! Judge: Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image. Maya: Don't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together! Phoenix: (I-I guess I got a bit carried away...) Kudo: Kah! There are other things I recognize about her, too. Kudo: There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (There's no doubt he remembers the waitress pretty well. What should I do? I get the feeling there's something more to this somehow...) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I must be imagining it. I need to find another angle with this guy.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the straps Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. You seem especially interested in straps. Why is that? Kudo: Wh-What? Phoenix: The ribbon in her hair, the straps on her apron. What's the fascination? Kudo: F-Fascination? Godot: Godot: People have all kinds of fetishes, Trite. We don't need to embarrass the witness. Kudo: Listen, you young upstarts! I haven't got some sick strap fetish! Judge: Hmm... Is there any relevance to the witness's unusual love of straps, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I was just curious as to why he was so fixated on the waitress's straps... Kudo: I said I haven't got a strap fetish! How many times do I have to repeat myself!? Judge: Very well. Continue with your testimony, Mr. Kudo. And make it strapless. Kudo: *grumble grumble* Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the waitress's back Phoenix: The identifying \"features\" you described are all things you would see from the back. Kudo: So what? Phoenix: Is it possible that... ...you never saw the waitress from the front at all!? Godot: Godot: Ha...! He's got you there, gramps! Phoenix: People normally talk about facial features when they're asked to describe someone. But this witness's testimony is nothing but straps and ribbons! Kudo: Th-This is harassment! I tell you I'm not obsessed with straps or ribbons! I'm just telling you what I saw! Judge: Mr. Kudo, the court requests that you add details about any identifying features... Features you observed from the front, that is, to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Maya: The old man's testimony is getting longer and longer! Phoenix: And if I can't find a hole in it soon, it'll get even longer, I bet. Adds statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\" Press (after adding statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm... Kudo: There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't find anything to be distinct, but you did clearly see the witness's face, yes? Kudo: No question about it! I didn't come this far to back down now! Victor Kudo never backs down! Phoenix: (That's not the answer I was looking for, but OK...) Maya: This has turned into a matter of pride for Old Seedy now, I guess... I wonder if he really did see Maggey's face or not... Phoenix: (Like I thought, we need some concrete proof of this. Proof that the old guy didn't see the waitress clearly from the front.) Present Apron Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\" Maya: Do you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it? Phoenix: Well, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there. Maya: But he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress... Phoenix: I-I guess... (Hmm, she makes a good point though...) Maya: Hey! Did I just say something clever? Phoenix: I wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw really was Maggey... Maya: That's what we have to figure out, Nick! Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this. Kudo: Kah! That filthy thing would suit filth like you just perfectly. Actually, it reminds me of what my grandson looks like, just after he's done eating. Phoenix: Have you ever seen this before? Kudo: Of course I haven't! Do you think I'd forget something as dirty as that!? Hmm? Well? You half-witted clot!? Phoenix: ... Judge: ... ......... Kudo: Wh-What!? What is it!? Ever since I said, \"you half-witted clot\", there's been an eerie silence in here. Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. This apron... ...is the apron worn by the defendant on the day of the poisoning! Kudo: Uh? Phoenix: And as you just said yourself... ...you wouldn't forget something like this. Which means, is you had really seen this apron before... Kudo: Er... Phoenix: Yes, you know what I'm getting at! You couldn't have possibly seen the waitress from the front! Kudo: ... Oops! Judge: Witness! You can't just \"oops\" your way out of this! Godot: Ha...! Well, well... Looks like we finally have a genuine trial on our hands. Phoenix: ... Godot: Listen, Trite. Here are the facts. On the day of the incident, there was only one waitress in the restaurant. Judge: That being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde? Godot: Exactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching! Judge: Hmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing. Godot: Just tell the court exactly what you saw, gramps. Kudo: You can rely on me, Captain! My noggin's in perfect working order. I can't remember a single occasion when I forgot what burger a customer wanted! Maya: He can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out... Judge: Very well. Let's test just how good your memory and attention to detail is, Mr. Kudo. Tell us what you remember about the victim. Witness Testimony -- About the Victim -- Kudo: He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles. He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages! The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well. Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino. The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip. Judge: The testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail. Kudo: Oh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything! Maya: How are we going to handle this, Nick? Phoenix: We only need to do one thing. We just need to prove that the old man's memory is shot. Maya: Just trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel? Phoenix: (I suppose... But it's what I do best.) Cross Examination -- About the Victim -- Kudo: He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Spectacles? Kudo: Dark glasses to you! One of the lenses was green, but the other was broken. Newfangled rubbish! That's why I remember him so well. Phoenix: (He did have some kind of lens over his left eye... But I wouldn't have called it a pair of glasses.) Judge: Hmm... He seems to have been wearing some rather modern-looking shades. Perhaps I should take to wearing some, and rival Mr. Godot's sharp appearance. Maya: Ah! We better come up with something sharp, and quick! Phoenix: (Guess I'll wait and see if I should challenge him about the \"spectacles\"...) Kudo: He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The newspaper was a sports paper, was it? Kudo: That young hooligan! I nearly asked him, \"Can't you even read without fidgeting, hmm!?\" How was I supposed to be able to read the back page with all that rustling going on!? I needed to find out if Gusten Brawn retained his championship title! Phoenix: (It was his paper, not yours! If you wanted to know so bad, why didn't you buy your own!?) Kudo: What are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? How dare you judge me! Phoenix: Ow! Ooow! Maya: Gusten Brawn got beaten yesterday, by the way. Anyway... Kudo: The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The wireless? Kudo: The decadent young rascal! In my day, it was one or the other! Read the paper, or listen to the wireless! Phoenix: (...Oh boy.) Kudo: And using an earpiece! It's selfish, that's what it is! I was straining my ears, but I couldn't catch any of it. Phoenix: (Was he that desperate to listen to the radio...?) Kudo: What are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? 2 you feel sorry for me! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Kudo: Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean the waitress, who you only saw from behind, right? Kudo: You're one of those, are you? You never let anything go, isn't that right? Phoenix: ...Maybe. Kudo: What does it matter if I saw her from the front or from behind!? My eyes don't lie! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! (I better not push it until I've got some hard evidence.) Kudo: The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"His free hand\"? Kudo: Yes. Phoenix: Which hand was that? Kudo: Weren't you listening before, cloth-ears!? I said he was rustling the newspaper with his right hand, didn't I? If his free hand wasn't his right hand, then which hand was it, you moron! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Godot: Ha...! Perhaps the great Mr. Trite has three hands! Phoenix: (Yeesh! I was only asking! No need to gang up on me and treat me like a freak!) Present Coffee Cup Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony?\" Phoenix: (The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.) Maya: I guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh? Phoenix: (Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!) Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony? That this was a way of testing the credibility of your memory? Kudo: I know, I know! There's nothing wrong with my memory, I tell you! Nothing! If I got anything wrong, I'll eat these seeds and sing the pigeon song! Godot: Care to tell us where this is going, Trite? Phoenix: According to Mr. Kudo, the victim was holding the paper in his right hand... ...while drinking coffee with his free hand, which would make that his left. Kudo: Kah! What is this? Kindergarten? Phoenix: But I would like the court to please take a look at this. Judge: That's the cup victim used, correct? Phoenix: Yes, and on the rim, you'll notice the mark left by the victim's lips. Judge: Yes. There is a stain left by the coffee. Phoenix: If you consider where that stain is, you'll clearly see... ...that the victim was holding the cup in his right hand! Kudo: But how...? Phoenix: Well, Mr. Kudo. The court is waiting for your epic performance! You said you'd eat those seeds and sing the pigeon song! Kudo: Aaaargh! Judge: Mr. Kudo... I'm afraid this is simply not acceptable. I think the witness had better go back to the park where he came from. Kudo: WAAAAIT! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to you tell me I'm mad, you're wrong! I don't care about that dirty coffee cup! I know what I saw! Judge: Y-You still insist on your testimony? Kudo: That young brat was holding the cup in his left hand! Oh, yes. No question! I'm a good, law-abiding citizen, I am. It's that dead young hotbot and you, you spikey-haired yahoo, who are at fault! Phoenix: (Who, me!?) Judge: Th-Thank you, old man. We've heard quite enough from you already. Kudo: Don't call me \"old man\", old man! Been around for 68 years, I have. You can't ignore me! LISTEN TO WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAAAAY! Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but... Godot: Sure, why not hear a little more? Judge: M-Mr. Godot! Godot: But this is my 16th cup of coffee... So this is your final stand. Kudo: Thank you, Captain! You can rely on Victor! Witness Testimony -- Left Hand or Right Hand -- Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs. He kept fiddling with it all the time. He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too. And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand! Judge: We know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye. Godot: It wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers. Judge: A monitor? You mean, like a television screen!? Godot: The inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work. Kudo: HDTV, DVD, CD... All these newfangled letters drive me mad! But they don't matter. I know what I saw, and I'm telling the truth! Phoenix: (It's true... He doesn't seem to be lying.) Kudo: And those are the facts, in good old black and white! Cross Examination -- Left Hand or Right Hand -- Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the victim was wearing an HMD. Kudo: HDTV, CD, DVD... What does it matter!? Phoenix: (It was none of them actually, but anyway...) And you're sure that he was wearing the earpiece on the same side? Kudo: No question! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting. Phoenix: (Yeah. That's pretty obvious if you look at the floor plans. From the opposite table, he'd only have a view of the side of the victim's head.) Present Victim's Prescription Bag or Glen Elg profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but...\" Kudo: He kept fiddling with it all the time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: It seems you kept an eye on Mr. Glen Elg. Kudo: He was getting on my nerves! Rustling that newspaper and fiddling with his earpiece all the time! And then he went and made all that fuss dying from one sip of javaccino! I wanted to say to him, \"Calm down, you young brat!\" Just looking at him made me suddenly speed up my seed eating! I could've chocked! Phoenix: (So I take it the victim was a walking ball of nervous energy...) Kudo: He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The earpiece you mentioned... Which hand did the victim touch it with? Kudo: ... You're one of those people! One of those people who uses his left hand to get things out of his right pocket. Or fastens his left cuff with his right hand? And when the tour guide says, \"On your right side, you'll see the famous blah-blah\"... ...you're the only one who deliberately looks left! Well? Aren't you? Phoenix: N-No! I didn't mean... Kudo: Obviously he used the hand on the same side of his body that the earpiece was in! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Ow! (So, if he had the HMD on his left side, then it was his left hand, I guess...) Kudo: And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You seem very sure of yourself, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: That's because I know what I saw, no matter what tricks you try to play on me! Phoenix: (It looks like he really did see the guy picking the cup up with his left hand. This is a dead end!) Maya: Well, Nick? What do you think? Phoenix: I think the guy's telling the truth. But even so... Something's not quite right. Maya: Then chuck evidence at him until he breaks! Phoenix: (But if he's not lying, there wouldn't be any contradictions in his testimony, right?) Phoenix: I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but... Mr. Kudo! There is something very strange about your observations of the victim. Kudo: What!? Phoenix: You say he was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the HMD. Kudo: No question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting. Phoenix: I don't think so. Kudo: Wh-What did you say!? Phoenix: You're no doubt unaware of this fact, Mr. Kudo. But the victim couldn't hear with his left ear! His eardrum was ruptured! Kudo: Eh? Phoenix: Traces of medication for his condition were found in his ear canal. That's right! It's impossible that the victim was wearing his earpiece in his left ear. Because he couldn't even hear in that ear! Kudo: ... Is that true, Captain? Godot: ...It is. Kudo: ...Pi... Pi-Pi-Pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Pretty pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Judge: Order! Order! Order! Phoenix: This witness's testimony is completely unreliable! He only saw the witness from behind. And he claims the victim was wearing an earpiece when we know his eardrum was ruptured! Well, Mr. Godot!? Godot: Aaaargh! A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup! The old man... ...is my drop of milk! Kudo: Captain! Are you calling me a drip!? Judge: This is the victim's coffee cup in which the potassium cyanide was found. The mark on the rim clearly shows that the victim picked it up with his right hand! Kudo: I'll never back down! I know I'm right! The lad drank his javaccino with his left hand! Godot: Let me put you out of your misery... Clearly, the victim used both hands. He took a sip with the cup held in his right hand, and then switched to his left... That's what the old man saw! Phoenix: Phoenix: Impossible! The witness has already testified on numerous occasions... ...that the victim died immediately after taking just one sip of the coffee. Godot: Godot: Which hand the victim used to pick up his cup is irrelevant, Your Honor. The facts still stand! With one hand or the other, Mr. Elg drank the poisoned coffee... ...Like this! Phoenix: Phoenix: Sadly, Mr. Godot, that doesn't wash! The point of this testimony was to establish whether the witness's memory was credible. And the results are clear! The testimony given by this witness is useless! Godot: Puuuurgh! Judge: I believe it is time to conclude today's proceedings. I am satisfied that the witness is not deceiving the court. But to be frank, his testimony is a farce! Kudo: D-Did you have to be so frank!? Take that, you pompous old fogey! Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo. You can't reach me from there. I'm ordering the defense and the prosecution to investigate this case further. That is all for now. This court is adjourned! ???: Kudo: WAAAAIT! If we stop now, where does that leave me? Judge: Leave you, Mr. Kudo? Kudo: Thanks to that blue-suited young upstart over there... ...I'm just a bumbling old man who can't even dot his t's or cross his i's now! Phoenix: (How is your bad memory my fault!?) Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but there's nothing I can do. Kudo: I've kept my mouth shut until now... ...but there's something else the court should know! Godot: What!? Phoenix: There's more? Kudo: To be perfectly honest, it might not be anything. But I want another chance! I want another crack at you, you young shark! Phoenix: M-Me? (He's looking at me like I'm some sort of evil Shogun...) Kudo: Well, everyone? What do you say to one final showdown? The final chapter in this eccentric old man's scrapbook! Godot: Sorry, gramps... I've already had my 17th cup of coffee. Kudo: What have you got to lose, Captain? I'll give you all the javaccino you want if you come to my house after the trial. (Changed from [I'll give you all the coffee you want if you come to my house after the trial.] in the original release) I may be 68 years old, but Victor Kudo is still a man! Judge: That's enough, witness. I believe it will be quicker for the court to just hear your testimony. Kudo: You bet! Much, much quicker! Maya: I can't believe this is happening... Kudo: Ha ha ha! You better get ready, youngster! Phoenix: I get the picture! Just quit throwing those seeds at me, would you!? (He's gotta be using some sort of infinite ammo code with that box of seeds...) Witness Testimony -- The Final Showdown -- Kudo: First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself. The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino... Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over. It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked! Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm? Judge: ... Um... Is that all? Kudo: Yes, that's all. I remember it perfectly. Eh!? You're doubting me again? You're doubting a poor, defenseless old man!? Judge: N-No. We are not doubting you, Mr. Kudo. Maya: Don't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick? Phoenix: Yeah. \"So what?\" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy! Kudo: You're a birdbrain, that's why that's all you can think of! Judge: Very well... Mr. Wright. Your final cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- The Final Showdown -- Kudo: First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Um... The court generally prefers if witnesses are sure of themselves, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Noisy brat! I'm warning you, I'm more savage than a macho man right now! You won't beat me with this testimony! This is the final battle! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! (He's chucking those seeds harder than ever! I better be careful...) Maya: Come on, Nick! Nail him! Kudo: The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The court has already heard that testimony, Mr. Kudo... Kudo: I know that! I was just setting the mood. How else am I supposed to build up the suspense, hmm!? Phoenix: The suspense? Kudo: Isn't it enough? Should I work the audience a bit more? Judge: No, no! Please continue, Mr. Kudo. As quickly as possible! Kudo: Alright. Now where was I...? ...Ah yes. The young boy slumped over the table, and... Kudo: Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A vase, you say? Kudo: Yes. There are vases on all the tables in that place. They're accidents waiting to happen! They're practically begging to be knocked over! Phoenix: (Well, he's right about there being vases. I do remember seeing them, too... There was a vase on the table when I ate munch there.) And you saw the moment when the victim actually knocked over the vase? Kudo: Well... it's hard to say... It's a bit unclear... How do you really define... Phoenix: OK, I get it. Kudo: I heard it break! And the sight of it is burned into my memory as clear as day! Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\" Kudo: It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Soaked in water, you mean? Kudo: Yes. It splashed me on the knee as well. Phoenix: You said you were sitting at a table across the room from the victim, correct? And yet, the water still managed to splash onto you? Kudo: ... It was cold! I clearly remember it splashing me! Phoenix: (Could the water really make it all the way across to the other side of the room...?) Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\" Kudo: Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean, the vase on the victim's table falling upside-down and breaking? Kudo: The vase turned upside-down, and my testimony's turning this case upside-down... It's a joke! I just wanted everyone to hear it! What do you think, Captain!? Godot: ...I'm impressed. By your ability to waste time. Phoenix: (Godot hasn't raised any objections for a while now...) Kudo: So, you young show-off! With that scrap of information, I'm throwing down the gauntlet! If I lose this one, I'll take it like a man and admit defeat! Phoenix: He's really giving you the evil eye, Maya. Maya: It's you he's looking at, Nick, not me! It's like he's saying, \"I triple dog dare you to find a contradiction, young'un!\" Phoenix: I guess I'll just have to rise to the challenge then... Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene. Kudo: Hmph! So what? Phoenix: Look carefully at the table. The vase is there... intact! Kudo: Huh? Phoenix: Lost your tongue, granddad? Kudo: ... I'm no granddad of yours, hop scotch! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Judge: Enough! If you throw any more seeds in this courtroom, the cleaners will be here all night. Kudo: Aaaaaah! Judge: ... What is it now? Kudo: I just remembered something! Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Go on... Kudo: The broken vase... Ha ha! It was on my table! Phoenix: Wha...? Kudo: Ah, well... You see... It startled me when that young lad collapsed. So I stood up. That must've been when it fell over. The vase on my table, I mean. Judge: The vase on your table? Kudo: Ah ha ha! Yes, it was on my table! And that's how my groin came to be completely soaked. ......... Judge: *sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today. Kudo: Er, I'd like to ask a question now. Have I, er... Have I been any use at all? Judge: Perhaps that's something you should reflect on yourself, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Aaaargh! WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else... Judge: Bailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom! Kudo: WAAAIT! LISTEN TO MEEEEEE! Judge: Well! We seem to have been considerably sidetracked. And I am still not in a position to deliver a verdict. Phoenix: ...! Judge: The defendant has not been positively identified as the waitress in question. Additionally, there are two disparities in the testimony we have heard thus far. Phoenix: The mark on the coffee cup that the victim supposedly drank from with his left hand. And the earpiece which was inserted into his left ear, out of which he couldn't hear. Maya: Wow, Nick! You did it! Judge: I therefore require both the defense and the prosecution to further investigate the facts. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Godot: ... Judge: There is one more thing before I call today's session to an end. Phoenix: O-One more thing, Your Honor? Judge: The witness we just heard from... He is most insistent that his testimony should be of use. So he's summarized it accordingly into this statement. Phoenix: Um... OK... Judge: You may each have a copy of it, if you wish. Godot: Whatever. The prosecution doesn't need props like that. Maya: Godot's really mad, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. I would be, too. Judge: Very well. Here you are then, Mr. Wright. There are 3 copies. My own, yours, and Mr. Godot's. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Victor's Testimony added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (\"I'm sorry\"? This isn't a piece of testimony! More like a five year old's apology...) Maya: What the heck are we supposed to do with 3 copies...? Judge: That is all. This court is adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned! Recipe for Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 January 7, 12:52 PMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: So how do you think the trial went this morning? Phoenix: How do you think it went!? Maya: It got a bit crazy in there. I just wonder if that killed our chances. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess it did get out of hand. Mr. Kudo's testimony did nothing to help us. Plus, now we don't even know the identity of the waitress who laced the coffee. Maya: All we know is what old Mr. Kudo saw... The apron straps, and the ribbon. Phoenix: And that the victim was wearing an earpiece when his eardrum was ruptured. Maya: Talk about a terrifying case of contradictionitus. Phoenix: Time to play doctor and find ourselves a cure then, huh? Maya: Yeah, we've gotta find one for Maggey, or she's going to have a terminal case of guilty! Talk What to do Phoenix: Well? I'm officially at a loss as to where to start. Maya: Yeah, me too. Let's try some brainstorming. You go first. Phoenix: I guess we should try to put Mr. Kudo's testimony to some sort of use. Maya: Yeah, that's true. Phoenix: And we need to figure out the identity of the waitress and who the victim really was... Somehow, I think the key to this case has got to be at Trés Bien. Maya: Well then, let's go back there and check it out again. Oh! And we should drop in on Maggey and see how she's doing, too. Any ideas Phoenix: So... Anything on your mind? Maya: Actually, there is something... Phoenix: ...? Maya: I was wondering about Xin Eohp... You know, like what he's like and stuff. Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I almost forgot about that guy. ???: I atta beat you so hard, it'll feel like youse were smoochin' the express train! ???: Phoenix Wright? Youse sayin' YOU' Phoenix Wright? ???: Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only! Phoenix: Actually... I've learned a little something about my doppelganger. Maya: Huh? You did? What did you find out? Phoenix: (Oh, yeah, Maya was working at the restaurant when I ran into Don Foneeonay...) Let's just say he was such a terrible version of me that I wanted to sue for defamation! (What's that guy's story, anyway? What does he have to gain by impersonating me?) Present Attorney's Badge Maya: That badge is totally useless, Nick. Phoenix: Huh!? Maya: I mean, no one suspected that Xin Eohp wasn't a real lawyer. I bet he didn't have an attorney's badge! Phoenix: ...I guess you're right. Maya: Or maybe he did have one! And maybe he switched your real one for a \"fugazzi\"! Phoenix: My badge? A fake!? ... Ha ha ha... That's a good one, Maya... Maya: Why the nervous laughter? ...Aha! I knew it! Your badge really IS fake, isn't it Nick? Sports Paper Maya: This doodle here... It was drawn by the victim, right? Phoenix: This is a newspaper from the day of the incident, so, yeah, we've got to assume so. There must be a clue in there somewhere. Maya: I guess we should show it around and see if anyone can tell us more about it. Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe there's a fake Nick running around. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. What's the deal with that? Why's he impersonating me? Maya: Maybe he's got something against you. People do tend to have a distinct distaste for you, Nick. Phoenix: (True enough... The only thing prosecutors seem to like about me is pushing me around...) Maya: Or... maybe he's got something against Maggey. Phoenix: (So he pretended to be me to get Maggey convicted?) Scooter Maya: That thing must've been in an accident. It's a total wreck! Phoenix: That's what the guy I met at the park was riding. And I'm betting he's the fake me. ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only! Phoenix: His voice is still ringing in my ears. Maya: Introduce me next time, Nick! I want to meet Xin Eohp, too! Jean's Loan Contract Maya: A loan of half a million dollars! I wonder what Mr. Armstrong did to get into that much debt. Phoenix: I'm going to guess he spent money needlessly. You'd better watch your spending, too. Maya: Hey, I've got a great idea! What if Mr. Armstrong charged $20,000 for the Twin-T set? Phoenix: If you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back! Victor's Testimony Maya: A letter of apology from the old man? Aww, how sweet. Phoenix: Actually, it's his \"testimony\"... If you can call it that. Maya: So? What's it say? ...\"I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry.\"? Heh heh! I used to break things all the time when I was little, you know. And I used to have to write apologies all the time, too. Phoenix: (Well, Pearls and Adrian seem to have picked up where you left off...) Coffee Cup Maya: That's the cup the poison was in, isn't it? Phoenix: Yeah, and the stain on the rim shows that the victim used his right hand to pick it up. Maya: But the old man swore he saw the victim pick it up with his left hand... Phoenix: (If Mr. Kudo wasn't mistaken, then what could account for this contradiction...?) Victim's Lottery Ticket Maya: Maybe I should try the lottery sometime, too. Phoenix: Sure, why not? If you hit the jackpot, you could win half a million bucks. Maya: So, what are you waiting for, Nick? Buy one! Phoenix: No way! Don't you know the lottery is a tax on people who are bad at math! Maya: Blah. Fine then. At least I can add it to the newly renamed \"Paths to Wealth\"! I'll have to call Pearly later and have her add, \"Buy lottery tickets whenever possible.\" Apron Maya: It's almost surreal that this artsy apron is what got us this far. Phoenix: Well, as art goes, this piece definitely leaves an impression. Maya: I guess that means the old guy never saw the front of it, huh? Which means he didn't see the waitress's face, either... Potassium Cyanide Maya: I can't believe they found this in Maggey's pocket. Phoenix: Yeah, but she was passed out, right? So the killer could've easily planted it on her. Maya: Where do you even get a hold of something like this? It's not like you can go down to your local CostMo' and buy it in bulk for $5 a pound! Phoenix: (She has got a point... How the killer got a hold of this poison is pretty important.) Victim's Prescription Bag Maya: \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\". Hmm... I guess if your eardrum was ruptured, you couldn't listen to the radio, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. It'd be pretty pointless to wear an earpiece of any kind. Maya: The medication in the bag is missing too, right? Phoenix: (The mysterious vanishing medication... Much like our mysterious \"other person\"...) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since then. I think Mia said it's because Maya's \"at a loss these days\"...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia really bailed me out again yesterday. Maya: Argh! That seedy old man was so rude to me! He didn't realize just how awesome I am. If he had, I bet he would've treated me better. Phoenix: Since when did you become so awesome? Godot profile Maya: Godot got it good today, huh? He was even smoking at me end there! Phoenix: He'll have a new witness ready for tomorrow, though. You can count on it. (We need to figure out the facts before then, or we're doomed!) Maggey Byrde profile Maya: A lot of strange conflicting things kept popping up today in the trial, huh? Phoenix: Yeah, and they seemed to come out of nowhere. Maya: That's why we've gotta go talk with Maggey and get out this whole thing straightened out! Phoenix: (Maggey said that when she brought the victim his coffee... ...there was one more people sitting at the table. This single contradiction is probably the most important one we have to resolve...) Glen Elg profile Maya: Have you noticed the victims in our cases tend to be people we know nothing about, Nick? Take Glen Elg, for example. Phoenix: Now that you mention it... Maya: We don't know what kind of guy he was, or why he was killed. I say it's time to get out there and find some answers! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: I really felt sorry for Gumshoe today. He really wanted to help Maggey out, but he kept getting backed into a corner. Phoenix: Maggey took it pretty bad, didn't she? Do you think she feels betrayed? Maya: Maybe. We've got to cheer her up somehow. She's a friend, after all. Phoenix: (A friend? Hmm... Never really thought of it that way, but I guess she is.) Victor Kudo profile Maya: It's the seedy old man! What's his name again? Phoenix: Vermin Kudo, is it? I can't remember, either. I've never seen a witness mess up so badly in court before. Maya: Better stay away from him a while, huh? Phoenix: (Yeah. It might be more than seed that he chucks at me next time.) Jean Armstrong profile Maya: The chef's a witness too, right? Phoenix: I suppose so. He was in the kitchen at the time of the incident. Maya: Well, since Old Man Seeds's testimony is pretty much useless to us... ...I guess we should speak to Mr. Armstrong again, huh? January 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: Looks like Gumshoe's not here. Phoenix: Never mind that. What's going on? It feels different in here somehow... Maya: You think? Phoenix: Yeah. Everyone seems to be on edge. Detective: What are you doing!? Call in the officers for the briefing, quick! Can't you shut down the station's server? Chief! Quit playing on the Internet! Chief: But my e-mail pen pal, 1337aZnPrInceSz! Detective: Save it for later! I'm turning it off NOW! Chief: Noooo! 1337aZnPrInceeeeeSz!! Maya: Everyone's keeping busy in here, huh? Phoenix: Keeping busy? More like panicking, if you ask me. (Something's going on. Something big...) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Even pickpockets can have their pockets picked.\" That's a keeper! Better to go with something that doesn't sound too much like a slogan. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a crime prevention campaign... ...But I'm not sure even he knows what kind of crime he's trying to prevent. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut. Chief: Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to write her a real letter instead of an email. Phoenix: (Alternately, you could write up some reports... Just a suggestion.) Chief: \"Dear 1337aZnPrInceSz, How are you? I'm OK! How was the show last night...?\" Maya: Wow, what an awesome job! Maybe I should send in my resume and become chief! Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\"! Right, Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Um... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: I guess Maggey's still in questioning. Maya: But! But we've got questions to ask her, too! Magg-ey! Magg-ey! Phoenix: Keep it down, Maya! This isn't a playground, you know! January 7Trés Bien Maya: Empty, as usual. Phoenix: Yeah, and it's lunchtime, too. ???: That's it! Come on, come on, come on! Phoenix: Hey, that sounds like... Gumshoe: Now just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can! Maya: He's getting really worked up about something. Gumshoe: Noooooo! That's the wrong number! Argh! Look like an \"8\" would have only netted me five bucks anyway! What a rip off! Maya: What's the problem, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Huh!? Oh, it's you... I, uh... I was uh... Hah hah! I was just... Hah hah hah! I was just listening to the radio, pal. Phoenix: To the radio? Maya: Hey, Detective Gumshoe's having lunch here! Phoenix: (He is! And he's having the Twin-T set...) Gumshoe: Aha ha ha... What can I say...? Examine Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Maya: It could say \"Entrance\" or \"Exit\", too. Did you think of that? Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: Hey, Nick. Do you think Old Seedy was talking about a vase like this today in court? Phoenix: It does look like it's ready to fall over any second. Looks kind of fragile, too. Maya: I bet if Mr. Armstrong charged 10,000 dollars for every vase a customer broke... ...he'd be able to pay off his loan really quickly. Phoenix: If you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got ya! I was just kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Maya: Wow, you really can't see the table in front or behind you at all! It's the perfect setup for slipping poison into your enemy's coffee. Talk Today's trial Gumshoe: This is a nightmare! How am I supposed to look Maggey in the eye now, pal!? Maya: You really drove her into a corner, you know. Gumshoe: You always blow apart my testimony! Why, of all days, didn't you do it today!? Phoenix: S-Sorry... There just weren't any holes in it... for once! Maya: Yeah, what happened? Usually, your testimonies are like Swiss cheese! Gumshoe: S-Swiss cheese...? Phoenix: (Would he have preferred, \"crumbly like aged parmesan\"? Anyway, this case has already been ruled on. There shouldn't be any holes left to find.) Gumshoe: So... Did Maggey say anything to you? About me, I mean. Maya: Well, um... How did she put it again...? Byrde: I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again! Maya: Something like that. Gumshoe: Wah... Waaaaaaaaaah! Maya: P-Please! Detective Gumshoe! I didn't mean... Gumshoe: Why!? Why is this happening!? Maya: He's banging his head against the wall, Nick! Phoenix: (Oh, man... Poor Gumshoe...) Lunch special Phoenix: So, did you like the Twin-T set? Gumshoe: I've never paid that much money for lunch before. I was so nervous, my hands were shaking. Maya: So? How did it taste!? Gumshoe: Well... For 20 bucks, I guess... I dunno how to describe it, really. It was... delicate. Maya: Delicate? Phoenix: You mean you liked it!? It didn't taste bad to you? Gumshoe: ... Maya: What's the matter with him? Phoenix: Looks like he's thinking... Gumshoe: ... That's it! I've been trying to think of the right word to describe the taste. I just got it right now... \"Bad\"! That's it. It tasted bad! Phoenix: *sigh* Gumshoe: It's kinda hard to admit it to yourself when you pay 20 bucks though, pal. Phoenix: (Maybe he should've found out about the price AFTER he had finished eating...) Maya: Maybe that's why Glen Elg came here. Maybe he heard about the famous Twin-T set! Phoenix: (Glen Elg, the victim, huh... Which reminds me. We still hardly know anything about the guy.) Maya: Why don't we ask Gumshoe what he knows, seeing as he's here? The radio Maya: So what were you all excited about earlier? Gumshoe: Huh? Phoenix: That's right! You said you were listening to the radio or something. Gumshoe: Oh, that? That was nothing! I-I wasn't excited! Maya: Come on, Detective Gumshoe! You can tell little ol' me! What were you listening to? Gumshoe: N-Nothing, really. It was just the, um... \"Daily Exercise Show\"! 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (What the...!? A Psyche-Lock?) Gumshoe: Hah hah hah! Mmm... This lunch special's lobster is great! Maya: Then why are there tears in your eyes...? The radio (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Lock) Maya: Come on, Detective Gumshoe. You can tell us what you were listening to on the radio. Gumshoe: But I already told you. It was the, um... the... weather forecast, pal. Phoenix: (Didn't you say it was an exercise program earlier!?) 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Gumshoe: It was nothing, really. Hah hah hah! Phoenix: (Even if it's nothing, the fact that he's hiding it makes me really curious!) The radio (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Gumshoe: I'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try. Phoenix: What's with everyone and the lottery...? Maya: So? How did it go? Gumshoe: I won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad! Phoenix: (Yeah, I know the feeling.) Gumshoe: I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg, see. (Changed from [I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg.] in the original release) And they've got this special radio show where they announce the winning numbers. (Changed from [When they read those results out on the radio, it really gets your heart pumping!] in the original release) They even do the drawings live on the air! It's intense, pal! (Changed from [You know they broadcast it live when they're picking the numbers? It's intense, pal!] in the original release) Maya: I bet that's what Mr. Elg was listening to on the day he was killed. (Changed from [I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.] in the original release) Phoenix: Yeah. What time is it now? Gumshoe: Uh, it's... It's just after 1:30. Phoenix: And are the lottery results always broadcast at the same time? Gumshoe: Yeah. Look, I got this flyer when I bought the ticket. Millionaire Radio Flyer added to the Court Record. Maya: \"Millionaire Radio\"? That sounds cool! I want to try it, Nick! Phoenix: Then buy a ticket, Maya. With your own money! The radio (subsequent times) Gumshoe: I'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try. Phoenix: What's with everyone and the lottery...? Maya: So? How did it go? Gumshoe: I won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad! Phoenix: (Yeah, I know the feeling.) Gumshoe: I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg, see. (Changed from [I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg.] in the original release) And they've got this special radio show where they announce the winning numbers. (Changed from [When they read those results out on the radio, it really gets your heart pumping!] in the original release) They even do the drawings live on the air! It's intense, pal! (Changed from [You know they broadcast it live when they're picking the numbers?

(Changed from [I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.] in the original release) I want to try it, Nick! Phoenix: Then buy a ticket, Maya. With your own money! Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? Gumshoe: It tells me the guy is cruising for a bruising! Maya: You're really caring, aren't you, Detective Gumshoe? About Maggey, I mean. Magatama (after clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, before breaking Psyche-Lock) Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- The Radio -- Phoenix: Alright, Detective Gumshoe, tell me the truth. What were you listening to? Gumshoe: No way, pal. Now that you've made a big thing out of it, I'm not gonna tell you... Phoenix: We'll see about that, pal. Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening... ...it's pretty clear what kind of radio program it was. I'd say it was related to... Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm right, aren't I?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Detective Gumshoe!? Gumshoe: Yeah! That's it, pal! You got me. You sure are something! Phoenix: (Then how come I'm still seeing the lock? Guess I was wrong... Now, what was it he shouting when he was listening to the radio...?) Gumshoe: That's it! Come on, come on, come on! Gumshoe: Now just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can! Gumshoe: Noooooo! That's the wrong number! Phoenix: (It seems so obvious... I'd better ask him again.) Gumshoe: D-Don't tell me you're not through yet... Leads back to: \"Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening...\" Phoenix: I'm right, aren't I? You were listening to the lottery results, weren't you? You thought you'd try to win big, just like Glen Elg did! Gumshoe: I-It's... It's like you can see right through me! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (Huh? I've cracked him already...?) Gumshoe: That's why I said it was nothing! Unlock Successful Sports Paper Gumshoe: That's the sports paper the victim wrote something in, right? ... Maya: What is it? Gumshoe: I know I've heard that name somewhere before... \"MC Bomber\"... Yeah... I heard it real recently, too... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Lunch Special Gumshoe: I haven't got anything to say about that, pal. ... Just take it away already, please? Phoenix: (Spending 20 dollars on this has got to be killing him inside...) Scooter Gumshoe: Hey! Are you putting this up for sale, pal? Phoenix: N-No! Why, would you want a busted up scooter like this anyway? Maya: Yeah. Plus, the seat's all covered in pigeon poop! Gumshoe: Who cares? If it runs, that's all that matters to me. Phoenix: (My phony was riding this bike... Maybe if I head back to the park. it'll be there again.) Victim's Lottery Ticket Gumshoe: A one-way ticket to happiness, huh? Phoenix: Glen Elg died because of this ticket. Gumshoe: Yeah, but it's still a one-way ticket to happiness, pal. Phoenix: And Maggey was found guilty of murder because of it, too. Gumshoe: ... Maya: ...Looks like anything about Maggey is an instant conversation stopper. Phoenix: Yeah. He's got a real soft spot for her, and it obviously hurts when you hit it! Apron Gumshoe: That's the apron Maggey was wearing. Yeah, it still smells like her, too. Maya: Does this mean Maggey smells like ketchup? Victim's Prescription Bag Gumshoe: We never did find the contents of that bag. Maya: It was medicine for Mr. Elg's ruptured eardrum, right? Gumshoe: Yeah. We found traces of it in his left ear canal. He must've used it while he was at Trés Bien. We're sure of that much. Millionaire Radio Flyer Gumshoe: Apparently everyone's listening to this show now. Maya: That's because everyone wants money. Gumshoe: They say that the victim, Glen Elg, was really into gambling. Maya: Yep. You can't beat gambling! I love it, too! I won 500 dollars last night playing cards with Nick. Phoenix: Huh? We were playing for money!? Maya: Of course! So you'd better pay up! Gumshoe: You're a smart one! ...Waiting for a cop to be present before asking for the cash! Godot profile Gumshoe: Mr. Godot agreed to take this case just so he could face you, pal. He was working on a bunch of more important cases, but he cancelled them all... Maya: Huh? But then... ...why didn't Mr. Godot take this case... ...when Maggey's first trial came up? Phoenix: Yeah. that is kinda odd. I mean, everyone thought the defense was \"Phoenix Wright\". So why didn't he try to fight \"me\" then? Gumshoe: Well, according to Mr. Godot... ...he knew the guy was a phony right away, so he didn't want to bother with the trial. Phoenix: (He couldn't be bothered to tell the judge!?) Maggey Byrde profile Gumshoe: Maggey's probably crying all alone right now, huh... Maya: Yeah, thanks to you. Gumshoe: Aaaaaaargh! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! Phoenix: Maya! Don't torch poor Gumshoe feelings like they're are some sort of cheap crème brûlée! Maya: You're really crazy about Maggey, aren't you? Gumshoe: No! No, no! I'm just... I'm not... It's not that I... Phoenix: (You don't have to hide it, Gumshoe! It's pretty obvious.) Maya: Yeah, you're way too plain-looking for Maggey. Right? Gumshoe: I'd arrest you right now if you weren't so right... Glen Elg profile Gumshoe: This guy was a real programming genius. They called him \"the walking computer\" at the place where he worked. Maya: What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!? Phoenix: (*groan* He wasn't LITERALLY a computer, Maya!) (Changed from [*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!] in the original release) Gumshoe: Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim. Phoenix: Yeah. That's what we found out yesterday, too. Maya: Hey, Detective Gumshoe. Don't you have any information that's a bit more fun? Gumshoe: F-Fun? I, uh... Oh! I know! So, have you paid a visit to where Elg worked yet? You might as well. Maya: His workplace? Where's that? Gumshoe: A computer firm called \"Blue Screens, Inc.\" or something like that. Maya: Sounds like a real stable company. This could be fun, Nick. Let's go! Phoenix: Computers aren't really my thing, Maya. Maya: We'll be fine! I know all about that hi-tech stuff. Phoenix: (I wonder about that...) Gumshoe: It's just around the corner from this joint. You should take a look. Phoenix: (A computer firm called \"Blue Screens, Inc.\" huh...) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I know I look a little rough around the edges. But the truth is, I'm a lot more \"detective-like\" than I used to be. Maya: Really? Like what part? Gumshoe: ...Like the color of my coat. Maya: Ah! You're right! Phoenix: (Yeah, but what about what's inside the coat...?) Victor Kudo profile Gumshoe: You know, in all my years, I've never seen a witness who was that confused before. Phoenix: Yeah, you looked pretty confused by his testimony. Gumshoe: Nothing against old guys, I like them and all... But... He sounded like he was pretty sure about what he saw. Maya: Yeah, that's the impression I got, too! Phoenix: (Me, three... But then, why doesn't even a single part of his testimony corroborate any of the facts?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh lá lá! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Maya: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". But I'll tell you want. This stuff works like a charm. I slept like a rock last night. Phoenix: O-Oh, really... That's nice... Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal... I can't discuss anything connected to the case. Maya: Hey! I thought you said you were going to help us out! Gumshoe: I can't help you out if I don't have any info! Phoenix: Yeah, I suppose the retrial has only just begun... January 7Vitamin Square Maya: Hmm... I don't see any sign of Mr. Kudo. Do you? Phoenix: Maybe he went to buy another ton of bird seeds. I was kind of hoping he wouldn't be here, anyway. At least, not for now. (Besides, any more seeds today and I'm liable to turn into a real phoenix!) Examine Scooter Maya: Hey, check this out... Phoenix: I wouldn't get too close to that if I were you. Otherwise you might be in for a shock. My phony must be lurking someplace nearby... Just imagine! A Tiger, loose in the city! Maya: Meanwhile the real Phoenix is like an abandoned chick, lost in a vast urban jungle! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Don't worry. Someday, you'll grow up and become a ferocious tiger, too! Don't lose hope! Phoenix: (Why is she trying to pep-talk me into becoming my phony...?) Orange Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: Speaking of fun, if we get Maggey acquitted, may be can all get together sometime. Maya: OK! ...But what do we play with someone who's never even won a game of Tic-Tac-Toe? Phoenix: How about we change the rules a bit, then? We could play Old Maid, and... um... We could say the person who's left with the old maid at the end is the winner. How's that? Maya: Not bad... Not bad at all! We could even rename the game to \"Fair Maiden\"! January 7Trés BienKitchen Maya: Huh? Mr. Armstrong's talking to someone. ???: I'll be back next month. Armstrong: Oui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you! ???: If you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here. Armstrong: Non! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise! ???: I love fire, you know... I love the way it crackles... Hee... Hee... Hee... Armstrong: Non, non, non! Stop it! I beg you! ???: Then don't let me down... I'll be watching you... Armstrong: Mais, non! Z'is is not necessary! You can trust me, mademoiselle! ???: Talk to anyone... and I'll drive a knife... right through your heart. Armstrong: Oh, non! You do not 'ave to worry. You know, you worry far too much. Maybe z'is will 'elp you relax. It is la oil of sandalwood. ???: I do love... raw meat... from time to time... Hee... Hee... Hee... Armstrong: Aaaaah! ???: I'll be taking my leave... Goodbye... for now! Armstrong: Urgh! I 'ave la shivers! I must rub some of my oil all over my body before I become z'e nervous wreck! Z'ere. Oh, oui, oui! Z'at feels good! Phoenix: Urgh! Armstrong: Oh là là! Excusez-moi, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My eyes! My EYES! Armstrong: Your eyes? If you 'ave trouble wi'z your eyes, you need z'is. La oil of sandalwood! Phoenix: Isn't this just the leftovers of what you were just using!? Examine Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I ate yesterday for lunch? Maya: Yeah, I think it's been permanently burned into my brain now... ...as an example of what truly awful food tastes like. Phoenix: (I bet it'd taste really good if it was prepared well. ...Balsamy even!) Talk Trés Bien Phoenix: You don't exactly have many customers, do you, Mr. Armstrong? Armstrong: Non, you are right, monsieur. But per'aps z'at is la perfect time for you to visit me, non? Now I can give you my undivided attention, and cook for you la dish suprême! Phoenix: Putting on a brave face, huh? Maya: That's what girls do, Nick! Armstrong: But you are right. Business is very difficult z'ese days. Per'aps ze name is la problem. People do not understand it. Z'ey think it is \"tray\". I just wanted people to think z'at my restaurant was exclusive. Phoenix: But they think you just serve fast food on cheap, plastic trays? Maya: Nick! That's the kind of thing that can make a girl cry! Phoenix: Have you forgotten that Mr. Armstrong is a man, Maya? Armstrong: But z'is restaurant is my life! It is everything to me! I will defend it to la finale! No one will take it from me! The woman just now Phoenix: So who was that woman you were just talking to? Armstrong: Oh lá lá! You saw z'at? Phoenix: Ah, well... Yes. Sorry. Maya: So? Who was she!? She looked so polite and graceful. Armstrong: P-Polite!? G-Graceful!? Maya: And she likes raw meat and fires, right? ???: I'll be back next month. Armstrong: Oui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you! ???: If you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here. Armstrong: Non! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise! Phoenix: (Now that I think about it...) Hey, Maya... I think it's pretty clear what kind of conversation they were having. Maya: You think so? Well, then let's show him that piece of evidence and see what happens! The woman just now (appears after presenting Jean's Loan Contract) Phoenix: The woman who was here earlier... I take it that she's... um... Armstrong: Why 'as it come to z'is...? What a tragedy! Suddenly I find myself so deep in la debt. It is a sign of la bad, bad world we live in, uh? Phoenix: (No. I'd say it's more of a sign of la bad, bad culinary skills...) Armstrong: Z'e woman who was 'ere... Z'e scary woman... She is from la loan office. Phoenix: Loan office? Is that where you borrowed half a million dollars from? Armstrong: Oui. Tender Lender, it is called. Maya: Catchy name. Just hearing it makes me wanna borrow some money. Armstrong: Please! You must not borrow from z'em. If you must, no more z'an ten dollars! Phoenix: Ten dollars? Sounds like your whole monthly stipend, Maya... Maya: Hey! I get a bit more than that, thank you very much! Phoenix: So Tender Lender is the loan office you borrowed half a million from, huh? Maya: I wonder if they've got anything to do with this case... Tender Lender (appears after \"The woman just now\") Armstrong: I am a weak woman. When I am upset, I 'ave to buy something nice to cheer me up. Thanks to 'im loaning me la money, I 'ave to pay back 'alf a million dollars now! I am like 'is slave. I 'ave to do everything z'at 'e tells me. Maya: Um... Who's this he? Armstrong: La Tiger... Maya: The Tiger? Armstrong: Oui. 'E is la manager of z'e Tender Lender. A terrifying man! La big city mobster! When 'e shouts at me, my knees are trembling and 'is voice is ringing in my ears for 3 days! As soon as I 'ear la noise of z'at battered old scooter 'e rides, I start to cry! Phoenix: (A big city mobster who rides a battered old scooter...?) Um, does this guy resemble me by any chance? Armstrong: Oh, non, non, non! Z'is man 'as a presence! A most formidable personality! Although... Oui, 'e does 'ave la spikey 'air just like you. Oui, z'ere is a resemblance z'ere, I suppose. Phoenix: (Hmm... Sounds like this loan office is worth checking out after all...) Armstrong: If you want to visit z'e Tender Lender, it is just beyond Vitamin Square. Maya: Hey, Nick... If you need money, I can loan you some... As long as it's less than 3 dollars... Phoenix: Um... Thanks for the offer... (...Just beyond Vitamin Square, huh?) Present Magatama Armstrong: Oh, what a beautiful pendant! It would look stunning on me w'iz la earrings! Maya: Please don't steal it again, OK? It's one of a kind! Armstrong: I could just 'ave a sliver of it, non? Maya: I-It's not a block of cheese, you know! Sports Paper Phoenix: This is the paper the victim brought with him. Armstrong: \"MC Bomber\"...? Oui... Maya: Does that mean something to you? Armstrong: Non, I only speak French, mademoiselle. Maya: But we found it behind your magazine rack... Armstrong: Oh, 'ow naughty I am! I 'aven't cleaned for such a long time! Lunch Special Armstrong: Oh là là! So you 'ave eaten my lunch, oui? Tell me, monsieur. Did you enjoy la lunch I prepared for you? Phoenix: It was a... unique and... wild mixture of flavors. Maya: That was the first time I ever had lobster, you know! Armstrong: Lobster? Z'ere was no lobster in my lunch... Maya: Huh? But, it said, \"lobster\" right on the menu. Armstrong: Mademoiselle Maya. Please, you must read la menu more carefully. It says, \"A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with a balsamic vinaigrette. Maya: Oh. It's \"inspired\", is it? Armstrong: Oui. \"Inspired\" by z'ese ingredients, but not per'aps made from z'em, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Well, guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, Nick. Phoenix: (The way the lunch tasted, it's probably 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.) Scooter Armstrong: ... Maya: What is it? Armstrong: Is z'is your scooter? Phoenix: No, no! I saw it before in Vitamin Square, you see... Armstrong: Mon dieu! Non, non, non! Take it away! Do not show z'at to me! Phoenix: (Talk about an allergic reaction...) Jean's Loan Contract Armstrong: So long as z'at paper exists, I am but a delightful angel w'iz la broken wings! Maya: An angel, huh...? Doesn't bode well, when you think about it... Armstrong: Oui! Z'ey kept 'arassing me month after month. In z'e end, I 'ad to give in. I agreed to 'elp z'em. Maya: Help them? With what? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr, if I did not owe z'em la money, I would 'ave refused. But my 'ands were tied! Phoenix: Please! What did you agree to help them with? Armstrong: Non. I-I cannot say! If I tell you, z'at woman, she will slice me up... ...and eat me w'iz la salad garnish! Phoenix: (Eww! I hope he doesn't mean that he'll literally be sliced up and served with garnish...) I'm going to guess that woman has something to do with your loan contract. Am I right? Armstrong: Ah! Maya: Please, Mr. Armstrong, tell us about that woman! Victor's Testimony Armstrong: Ah, it is true. My vases are broken all z'e time. I bought a new one z'e next day after la incident. But z'ey wouldn't let me put it on la table because of la investigation. Victim's Lottery Ticket Armstrong: If only I 'ad taken z'e right lottery ticket... I would not 'ave any debts right now. I would be free! Maya: Look on the right side, Mr. Armstrong. You won a dollar, right? Phoenix: (A lack of remorse for having stolen something: Priceless.) Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: You 'ave la perfect face for a waitress, you know. Maya: Um, thanks. I guess if things don't work out someday, then maybe I'll be back. Phoenix: (What things? Is she talking about her being a spirit medium...?) Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Oh, 'ow it 'urts me to see z'at poor girl's face! Phoenix: Maggey's? Armstrong: I 'eard she was super'umanly un'appy. Maya: Superhumanly...? Armstrong: And if she 'adn't come to work for me, she wouldn't 'ave got into z'is mess. Phoenix: (Huh? I'm missing something here, aren't I?) Armstrong: Je suis désolé, Maggey! Forgive me! After presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien: January 7Blue Screens, Inc. Maya: Wow! This place is so hi-tech! You can almost smell the electricity in the air! Phoenix: It is a computer firm, Maya. They can't work without electricity, you know. ???: Who are you? Maya: Oh, umm... Hello... ???: I'm sorry. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only. This is a computer programming laboratory. There are far too many trade secrets that could be leaked. Maya: Wow! What secrets!? ???: Everything you see here is classified. No information can leave this building. Maya: Understood! Phoenix: (Who is this woman? She's like a robot from some kind of whacked edumacational show...) Basil: My name is Lisa Basil. I'm the company director. Phoenix: D-Director!? (Sh-She's human!? She seems more like a ghost in a shell. And that thing over her eye... Isn't that the same device as Glen Elg's?) Maya: That's an [sic] DMH, right? Phoenix: Nice try, but it's the other way around, Maya. It's an HMD. Basil: All of my programmers here at Blue Screens, Inc. are supplied with HMDs. Maya: Then do you write programs, too? Basil: No. I just enjoy wearing this. Maya: They ARE pretty cool! I wouldn't mind one! Examine Pillars Phoenix: Those pillars almost look like they're moving. It's kind of unsettling. Maya: Nah, they just look a bit twisted or warped or whatever word I'm looking for... Basil: This office was designed with a futuristic feel in mind. Maya: Futuristic? Basil: Yes. We tried to imagine what things might look like in the future when we designed it. It helps to soothe and calm the soul. Maya: ... On second thought, I agree with you, Nick. This place is really unsettling. Super computer Maya: Hey, look Nick! It's a super-computer! It looks like it's really smart and wise, doesn't it? Phoenix: Computers are only as smart as the humans who use them, Maya. Maya: That explains why we don't use the computer in our office! Phoenix: You work there too, Maya. Maya: Yeah, but at least I'm... Basil: Please. Don't argue about something that's so trivial. Otherwise the computer will laugh at you. Maya: She said she'd laugh at us, Nick. Phoenix: (She's a human, Maya, not a computer!) Programmers Phoenix: He's really pounding that keyboard, isn't he? Maya: Wow! I bet that's where the \"pro\" in \"programmer\" comes from, huh? I guess I shouldn't be resting on my laurels. Gotta expand my skill set and all that. Phoenix: Yeah, that's a good idea. Maya: Maybe I could become Old Seedy's apprentice. Phoenix: (Um... And what about your spirit medium training?) Tickets on floor Maya: Wow! Look at this mess! Phoenix: Looks like they're all betting tickets. Maya: What kind of betting tickets? Phoenix: For betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets. Maya: Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these... Phoenix: (Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.) Glen Elg's Losing Horse Racing Tickets gathered up. Maya: This many tickets would get you... what? A buck down at the recycling center? But I didn't know you were so hard up that you'd try to profit from the dead, Nick. (Changed from [You're hopeless, Nick. You know that?] in the original release) Phoenix: (I'm just taking them as evidence, Maya!) Tickets on floor (subsequent times) Maya: Wow! Look at this mess! Phoenix: Looks like they're all betting tickets. Maya: What kind of betting tickets? Phoenix: For betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets. Maya: Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these... Phoenix: (Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.) Horse calendar Maya: Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess! Phoenix: Looks pretty average to me. Maya: But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this. Phoenix: You think? Real whiz-kids can work under any condition, you know. Maya: ...! Phoenix: (She's trying to hint that I should tidy my desk more. I'll clean up my desk when Maya stops asking silly questions... No hurry then.) Maya: Hey! This calendar... Phoenix: What about it...? If this is another hint about tidying, you can forget it. Maya: Someone's marked December 3rd in red pen! Phoenix: December 3rd? That's the day Mr. Elg was murdered! Is there anything else? Maya: Yeah. Umm... It says, \"Meet with The Tiger.\" Phoenix: The T-Tiger? Glen's Calendar added to the Court Record. Horse calendar (subsequent times) Maya: Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess! Phoenix: Looks pretty average to me. Maya: But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this. Phoenix: You think? Real whiz-kids can work under any condition, you know. Maya: ...! Phoenix: (She's trying to hint that I should tidy my desk more. I'll clean up my desk when Maya stops asking silly questions... No hurry then.) Talk Blue Screens, Inc. Phoenix: So... What exactly is this firm's business? Basil: I will try to simplify it so that you can understand... We analyze the data management systems required by certain branches of industry... ...and deliver optimum operating system and source-level components. Maya: Huh? You lost me on the corner of Analyze and Management. Phoenix: It doesn't matter. They analyze stuff. You got that much, right? Basil: The software we produce is distributed on CDs. Maya: CDs...? Basil: Yes. Compact disc. Digital optical storage media. Phoenix: (Of course, CDs are used for software as well as music...) Basil: It is a small firm, but all of my employees are first-class programmers. Let's ask one of them what they are doing. Excuse me. What are you working on right now? Programmer: I'm researching the impact of time-slicing common areas in multi-threaded code on logical access to shared global variables. Obviously, program structure heavily influences response time and performance, so the co-independence of global variables and memory overheads is vitally important to the success of the execution. Basil: Well, you get the idea. This is the sort of thing we are involved in. Did you good people follow all of that? Maya: Y-Y-Yeah... Phoenix: (Your blank smile just said otherwise, Maya.) What happened Phoenix: You know about what happened, right, Ms. Basil? Basil: You mean about Glen being poisoned? Yes, I know. It's terrible. Maya: Can you tell us anything that might be helpful? Basil: I don't think so. A police officer was here earlier, too. But I couldn't tell him anything either, because... ...the waitress who committed the crime has nothing to do with Blue Screens, Inc. Maya: Oh... Phoenix: How about Mr. Elg's desk? Have you cleared it out already? Basil: No, not yet. It's the one, right in front of you. If there's anything that might be useful to you, you are welcome to take it. Phoenix: (I guess there might be a clue here somewhere...) Glen's troubles (appears after presenting Glen Elg profile) Phoenix: Um, about Mr. Elg... Was he in some kind of trouble? Basil: I'm sorry? Why would you think that? Phoenix: I thought you said something about it just now? You said he got himself into trouble because he was a bit of a \"loser\". Basil: ... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Three Psyche-Locks?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock?] in the original release) Maya: I guess Mr. Elg is like every other man with his pile of secrets. Glen's troubles (subsequent times) Phoenix: Please tell us more about the trouble that Mr. Elg was in. Basil: I'm sorry. I don't know anything about that. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Basil: I do not pry into other people's affairs. Maya: She just gave us the dreaded \"professional, business-like cold-shoulder\", huh? Phoenix: (I need to find out exactly what the victim was involved in. Looks like I've got to break her in a \"professional, business-like\" manner!) Present Glen Elg profile Phoenix: Um, about Mr. Elg... Basil: He was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. But he did suffer from one or two bugs in his personality. Maya: Oh? Like what? Basil: He was a bit of a \"loser\"... Perhaps that would be the best way to describe it. That's what got him into trouble... ... Maya: What's the matter? Basil: He was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. So he was really no trouble at all. A model employee. Phoenix: Hey, wait a minute! Just now you said something about him being in trouble! (We've got to find out what this trouble was exactly.) Anything else Maya: Umm, would you mind taking a look at this? Basil: I'm sorry. That data is SuPer-Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected. Maya: SuPer Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected!? What!? This is madness! Phoenix: No, Maya. That is SPARDA. She won't tell us unless we say the right code word. Maya: A code word? Hmm... ... Sesame! Basil: ... Maya: If it's not \"sesame\", then it must be her mother's maiden name. That's how it always is. Phoenix: There's no point in having a password if it's always the same thing, Maya. (I guess she just doesn't want to talk about this.) Maya: Maybe we should focus on asking about Glen Elg. What do you say? Trés Bien Present Lisa Basil profile Gumshoe: That lady is the boss of Blue Screens, Inc., pal. Yeah... I figure she's clean. She got nothing to hide. She seemed kinda like a doll to me. In a good way and a bad way. ... Kinda makes you think she might be hiding something. Trés Bien (after breaking Psyche-Lock, then clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien, and clearing \"Tender Lender\" Talk option in Trés Bien - Kitchen) Gumshoe: Well, I'm gonna head back to the precinct now. We've got a big meeting starting in a bit. Maya: About Maggey's case, you mean? Gumshoe: No, that's pretty much wrapped up now... There's another big case going down at the moment, so she's been pushed aside... Maya: OK. Well, see you later then. Gumshoe: Bye! Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... Phoenix: ......... Y-You better get going, Detective, or you'll be late. Gumshoe: Actually, I, um... I've kinda got a favor to ask. It's a big one! Phoenix: A favor? Gumshoe: Yeah... It's for, um... Maggey, actually. I was kinda hoping... you'd give this to her for me. Maya: What is it? Gumshoe: It's a lunchbox. I got up early so I could make it. I've been real worried about her. She looked like she'd lost a lot of weight. Maya: Detective Gumshoe... ... How many weenies are in here!? There's not a person on earth who could down this much meat. Gumshoe: You think? I love weenies. I can't get enough of their tender juiciness. So will you give to her? It took me ages to make, so please say you will, pal! Phoenix: (I can't exactly say no, can I?) Gumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya to carry. Maya: Maybe I'll eat it myself if I get hungry! Gumshoe: Don't forget, OK? I'm counting on you to give that to Maggey. Phoenix: (He's finally gone...) January 7Tender Lender Maya: ...This place gives off a really strange vibe, doesn't it? Phoenix: Looks like \"The Tiger\" isn't in his lair. (And that is, as they say, a very good thing.) ???: ...Welcome... Phoenix: *gulp* (Talk about a creepy voice! It makes your soul want to shrivel up and die!) ???: You're here... to discuss a loan...? Phoenix: Uh, no. Not exactly... ???: The manager is away at the moment... Wait quietly... please... Maya: She's gone! Just like that! Phoenix: I guess we'll just have to come back another time. Maya: But this is the perfect opportunity, Nick! This place reeks of suspicion! Come on, Nick! Let's take a look around, OK? Phoenix: Do you think it'd be OK...? Maya: Of course! No one will ever know... ???: ...Coffee...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll leave it here for you to enjoy... Quietly. Phoenix: Y-Yes! Thank you! ???: Do not touch the desk... Please... Maya: N-N-Nick! Let's g-get out of here! Phoenix: (NOW she wants to get out of here...) Examine Desk on rug Phoenix: That's one impressive desk on one impressive rug! Maya: It's solid gold, Nick! Gold! Just look at that shine! Only real gold shines like that. Phoenix: Would you really want such a shiny desk, though? Maya: I don't know, but let's see what it's like to sit at a solid gold desk... Wow! I'm completely dazzled! Phoenix: That's because it's completely dazzling! Maya: I can see up my nose in the reflection! That's gotta be really distracting! Phoenix: (So the desk isn't practical. No surprise there.) Punching bag Maya: What's this? Phoenix: It's a punching bag. Maya: What!? No way. You wouldn't catch me walking around with a bag like that! Phoenix: What do you mean, \"walking around\"? Maya: The design's gross to start with, and it's way too heavy to be practical. And why's it called a \"punching\"-bag? Don't people know messenger bags are in! I knew it. I was right before, back at Trés Bien. Paris fashion is more my thing. Phoenix: (I really, really hope she's pulling my chain on this one.) CD player Phoenix: There's a CD player on the desk. But the desk is so loud, it's a wonder you can hear it. Maya: The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into. ???: Have you finished... ...the coffee? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Y-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely. ???: ... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... *gulp* ???: ...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup... Phoenix: (Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!) Maya: Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast... Phoenix: I-I sure hope so... (We better take a look at that CD while we're still alive and have the chance...) What the...!? Maya: What!? It's not the Rocko soundtrack, is it? Claw of the Tiger? Phoenix: It's... It's a demo CD... The artist's name has been hand-written on the disc in pen. \"MC Bomber\"... Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (This must be the CD Maggey told us about!) Maya: Let's listen to it! I bet it's heavy metal! Phoenix: No way! That woman'll make us drink more coffee if we do! MC Bomber added to the Court Record. CD player (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a CD player on the desk. But the desk is so loud, it's a wonder you can hear it. Maya: The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into. ???: Have you finished... ...the coffee? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Y-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely. ???: ... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... *gulp* ???: ...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup... Phoenix: (Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!) Maya: Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast... Phoenix: I-I sure hope so... Items on bookshelf Maya: Let's see... This round doll thing is called a \"daruma\"... I think. I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering. Phoenix: You mean you aren't making stuff up for a change? Maya: Heh. I bet you also didn't know that no matter what, he'll always right himself. Go on, Nick! Give him a good shove! Phoenix: Only if I feel like dying! Maya: Now, this yellow thing... This is a Japanese chess piece. I think it's a \"king\"? Not that I'm an expert or anything... I'm more of a Reversi person, you know. Phoenix: (Assuming she knows what she's talking about, these aren't exactly your typical... ...\"mobster wannabe\" items. They're not... \"trophies\", are they...? *gulp*) Maya: Hey... There's a piece of paper sticking out from under here. Phoenix: What is it? ...A repair bill? (Looks like he did some repair work on his car... Does he even have one...?) $15,000 to replace a bumper and a light!? That's insane! Maya: The car's registered to... the \"Cadaverinis\"? Phoenix: Huh? So it's not even The Tiger's car? (Why would someone else's repair bill be in The Tiger's office...?) Repair Bill added to the Court Record. Items on bookshelf (subsequent times) Maya: Let's see... This round doll thing is called a \"daruma\"... I think. I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering. Phoenix: You mean you aren't making stuff up for a change? Maya: Heh. I bet you also didn't know that no matter what, he'll always right himself. Go on, Nick! Give him a good shove! Phoenix: Only if I feel like dying! Maya: Now, this yellow thing...

Phoenix: (Assuming she knows what she's talking about, these aren't exactly your typical... ...\"mobster wannabe\" items. They're not... \"trophies\", are they...? *gulp*) Frame Phoenix: \"Win Through Compromise\"...? Maya: I wonder what that's supposed to mean... Phoenix: It must mean something if they took the trouble to frame it like that. Maya: Yeah well, it still doesn't make any sense to me... ???: ...That... Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: That's Tender Lender's guiding principle. Maya: Oh? ???: \"Compromise the customer to win.\" Maya: O-Oh, I see... How about you, Nick...? Phoenix: Yeah, umm... Well, as long as we don't have to compromise my hair, I'd say we're OK... (That's one slogan no business owner should ever explain to their customers... *shudder*) Spilled ashtray Maya: Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up. Phoenix: Yeah. It's all over the rug and everything. Maya: I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal. Phoenix: (How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?) Maya: Oh, hey! There's a book of matches here, too! Phoenix: Matches, huh? Places don't give those out much nowadays. ...Hey, wait a second! Maya: What is it? Phoenix: Look what's printed on its cover! It says, \"Trés Bien\"! (Changed from [Look what's printed on the back! It says, 'Trés Bien'!] in the original release) Trés Bien Matches added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (These matches could come in handy. We might be able to use them...) Maya: Yeah. The pilot light for the office boiler keeps going out. Phoenix: Swing and a miss, Maya. Swing and a miss. Spilled ashtray (subsequent times) Maya: Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up. Phoenix: Yeah. It's all over the rug and everything. Maya: I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal. Phoenix: (How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?) Hanging clothes Maya: Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic! Phoenix: (Looks more like a pimp coat to me... Guess I haven't got an eye for fashion.) Maya: Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick. Phoenix: Hmm... The same color as my suit...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Keep your voice down, Maya! Maya: N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this! ???: Some cake...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll just leave it here for you... Maya: Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks... ???: Just wait here quietly... Otherwise... Maya: S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said! Phoenix: Y-Yeah! Sure! ???: I have my eye on you... Only so I can \"take care of you\".... Understand...? Maya: Aah! I'm scared, Nick! Phoenix: ...So? What were you getting so excited about before? Maya: Look, on the lapel of this suit... Phoenix: That's...! That's an attorney's badge! Maya: Is The Tiger a lawyer!? Phoenix: No way! Look at this thing! It's made of paper! (Changed from [No way! Look at this badge! It's made of paper!] in the original release) Paper Badge added to the Court Record. Maya: For some reason, your badge suddenly looks really cheap to me, Nick. Phoenix: (Why doesn't anyone recognize an obviously fake badge when they see one...?) Hanging clothes (subsequent times) Maya: Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic! Phoenix: (Looks more like a pimp coat to me... Guess I haven't got an eye for fashion.) Maya: Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick. Phoenix: Hmm... The same color as my suit...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Keep your voice down, Maya! Maya: N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this! ???: Some cake...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll just leave it here for you... Maya: Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks... ???: Just wait here quietly... Otherwise... Maya: S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said! Phoenix: Y-Yeah! Sure! ???: I have my eye on you... Only so I can \"take care of you\".... Understand...? Maya: Aah! I'm scared, Nick! After examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes: ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Come out from under the desk, Maya!) The Tiger: Whad are youse two snoopin' around in my office for!? Phoenix: N-Nothing. W-We were just... The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! My precious carpet! Youse got ash on my rug! You' gonna wish your ugly feet never came through my door! Phoenix: I-It wasn't us! It was already like th-- The Tiger: Youse wanna argue with me!? Is that what you' doin'? You dink youse can take me on!? I'm gonna flatten youse two into pancakes and turn youse into my new rugs! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: ...Oh... Don Tigre... You're back... Phoenix: (Ack... That voice... It's like evil seeping into your head through your ears...) ???: ...I'm sorry... Don Tigre... I knocked over that ashtray before... and... Phoenix: (Eek! Has she got a death wish or what!?) The Tiger: ... Oh, right. Phoenix: Huh? The Tiger: F-Forget about it, Violetta. I-It's noddin'... Phoenix: (What, what, what!?) The Tiger: I ain't gonna get mad at you. You' too cute, you hear! Phoenix: (That's so unfair!) ???: Here... Have some cookies... I just baked them... And you'll need some strong espresso... while you're discussing your loan... The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: Y-Yes!? The Tiger: Youse either crazy or just plain stupid to chase after me! I worked so hard, but now youse gotta come and mess up my plan... Phoenix: (So it was him... He's my phony...) The Tiger: Heh, but I don't care. No one gets in my way! Phoenix: Wh-What? I mean, e-excuse me? The Tiger: Heh heh heh! Youse shoulda left de little girl at home, Wright. Phoenix: Um... I have a few things I want to ask-- The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! The Tiger: No questions! Dis is de last time we meet! Phoenix: Ack! Wait! P-Please! Maya: ...That was pretty weak, Nick. You waited until he was out of earshot before you shouted after him. Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk! I didn't hear you scream, \"Hold it!\" either!) ???: ...The espresso... Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: ...And cookies... Phoenix: (This woman is definitely not good for my heart. Now, what was it The Tiger called her...? \"Violetta\"?) Talk Tender Lender Phoenix: So... I'm kind of curious about your company, Tender Lender... Violetta: ...With the warm and friendly atmosphere you'd expect from a family-sized business... ...a conscientious rate of interest... and an attractive repayment policy... Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling this sentence is not going to end well...?) Violetta: ...we will tenderly lend you that little bit extra, here at Tender Lender. Maya: Hey, Nick. Things are a bit tight for Wright and Co. at the moment, aren't they? I mean there's that 500 dollars you owe me from our card game for starters. Why don't you take out a loan? Phoenix: (Would I like to take out a loan from a place like this? Not so much...) Violetta: Tender Lender is... on your side... Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: So, um, let's say I'm late with my repayment... What happens then? Violetta: ...We'd give you more coffee... ...Strong coffee... Phoenix: Um, right... I think I'd rather skip down! Maya: Hey! Just remember I can make strong coffee too, Nick! Strong tea, as well! What happened Phoenix: So, um, do you know about the incident we're investigating? Violetta: What incident...? Maya: Well, a man was poisoned in a restaurant just near here. That incident. Violetta: Let me see... I was here that day, with the manager... Phoenix: The manager being The Tiger...? Violetta: ...Furio Tigre... Maya: F-Furio... Phoenix: ...T-Tigre? (So that's where the \"Tiger\" thing comes from...) Maya: Xin Eohp's got a real name! Nick! Hurry up and find out more about him! Saved your life? (appears after presenting Furio Tigre profile) Violetta: I'm very... frail, you see... Just recently, I... died... Once... Hee... Hee... Maya: You d-died!? Violetta: About 4 months ago... The doctors said to... abandon all hope... Phoenix: (I guess they were expecting her to take a boat ride across the River Styx.) Violetta: But Don Tigre... He saved me. He gave up everything... Maya: Everything!? Violetta: When I found out what he had done for me, I... was happy... Maya: No offense, but I'm finding that a little hard to believe. Violetta: I decided I'd pay him back... with my life... by serving him coffee... and espresso... Phoenix: (I still wonder about what's in her coffee...) So... is that why you've got that bandage around your head? Violetta: Hee... Hee... Hee... This? The head bandage (appears after \"Saved your life?\") Phoenix: Um, so what's the story with the bandage? Violetta: ... They put it on after the operation... Maya: Operation? Violetta: It's just a little injury... A little, fatal, injury... Hee... Hee... Hee... Maya: A f-f-fatal injury!? Phoenix: (Maya just suffered one herself, by the sound of it...) So, that's the injury you were talking about before when you said you had died once? Violetta: ... 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: ...! Maya: Urgh! She really creeps me out, Nick! Phoenix: (Same here. But we've got to find out the truth!) The head bandage (subsequent times) Violetta: It was very complicated... The operation... They opened up my head... And performed surgery on my frontal lobe... Maya: Urgh! Just thinking about it sends shivers down my spine! Phoenix: So how did you get this \"fatal injury\" that left you needing an operation? 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Violetta: I made a promise to Don Tigre... I said I would never tell... Cross my heart and hope to drink 100 cups of espresso... Phoenix: Oh. (That much caffeine would raise anyone from the dead!) Violetta: Besides... It's a very precious memory to me... Phoenix: A... A precious memory...? (I'll never find out what she means if I can't break her...) Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Can I ask you about The Tiger, I mean, Mr. Tigre? Violetta: ...Cookie...? Maya: S-Sure...? Violetta: How do you like my cookies? I baked them myself... Hee... Hee... Hee... Maya: Go ahead, Nick! The honor is all yours! Phoenix: No, no! Ladies first, Maya! Violetta: Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: (No matter how I look at this, I just don't get it... What are The Tiger and this scary girl doing working together?) Violetta: We... are lovers... Phoenix: (That's not exactly coming across in your tone of voice...) Violetta: And I owe Don Tigre my life... He's the one who saved me... Phoenix: The Tiger... saved you...!? Violetta: Please, address him properly as \"Don Tigre\". Otherwise, I'll have to... Phoenix: OK, OK! Don Tigre! Of course! I'm sorry. (He saved her life? I'd sure like to how that happened.) Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Violetta: More coffee...? You must have more... Phoenix: No! Um, thanks! I've had enough. Really! (I'm so thirsty!) Violetta: I don't leave the office... I can't tell you about anything... except Don Tigre. January 7Vitamin Square Maya: There he is! Old Seedy's back feeding the pigeons again! Kudo: There! Take this! And this! And get out of my park! Phoenix: Like I thought, he's really mad... Come on, Maya. Just keep your head down and let's sneak away while we still can... Maya: What? Why? Hellooo, old man! Phoenix: What are you doing, Maya!? Kudo: Huh!? ...Kah! Maya: Hey, he just turned his back on us! Phoenix: I'm not surprised. I bet I really hurt his pride in court this morning. Maya: Hey, Mr. Kudo! Kudo: Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Hmm, pi-pi-pigeon, hmm... Kah! Maya: Look, we really need to talk to you, alright? Kudo: Out with the demons! In with good fortune! Maya: Ow! Ow! Ow! Seeds... Shell splinters... Painful... Phoenix: I always knew you were a demon, Maya! Talk Today's trial Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry about what happened in court earlier today. Kudo: Kah! Everyone'll be talking about me behind my back now! A dirty old man who was so busy looking at the serving girl's backside... ...that he can't remember her face! A filthy, depraved animal! Phoenix: N-Not at all! Kudo: Are you listening to me, boy!? I don't care what you say, I saw that waitress put it in! She put some white powder into the young lad's javaccino! Maya: We hear you... Kudo: And another thing! The young layabout was wearing an earpiece! On the same side as the lens of his broken spectacles! Maya: W-We're really sorry... Kudo: So I made a little mistake about the vase. So what!? I know what I saw! I tell you, I tell you, I tell you! Phoenix: OK, OK! Take it easy, please, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Don't tell me to take it easy, you spikey-haired brat! Take this! Embroiderer Maya: Um... You said you were a craftsman, right? Kudo: Kah! The modern world casts honest craftsmen like me aside in droves! Maya: S-Surely it's not that... Kudo: I come from a long line of craftsmen. Right back to the time of the shoguns! Do you hear me!? I didn't become an embroiderer, I was BORN one! Maya: Actually... I'm kind of in the same situation myself. Kudo: I... I... I wanted to stick my fingers up that dribbling old judge's nose... ...and scream right down his earhole... \"Objection!\" Maya: Oh... So, did you want to become a lawyer when you were young...? Phoenix: I don't think that's quite it, Maya. I think he's just in a bad mood, that's all... Kudo: I've got a tsunami of frustration inside and it's ready to burst out! Phoenix: (If we let him start rambling now, we might never shut him up! What should I do?) Cut in Phoenix: Um, actually, we've got places to go, things to check and stuff... Maybe another time? Kudo: Fine! Whatever! Just don't forget! I've got a tsunami's worth of grumbling to do. Phoenix: Yes, yes. This girl right here is really looking forward to hearing it all. Honest! Maya: What!? I never said that! Kudo: Come to the place where I work, then. Here. Bring this along with you. Phoenix: (What is this? It's covered in seeds... A discount coupon for a burger!?) Maya: He really wants someone to grumble at, huh? ...Although, it IS a burger joint... Leads back to Talk options Suck it up Phoenix: (Guess I better let him talk...) So, there's not much call for craftsmen these days, then? Kudo: Of course not, you idiot! All I'm good for nowadays is running errands! Maya: Errands? Kudo: Everyone takes advantage of the elderly! \"Buy some bread, gramps!\" \"Take the dog for a walk, granddad!\" \"Feed the pigeons, old man!\" What am I? Some sort of two-bit community handyman!? Maya: Um, well... Kudo: \"Buy some bread\", now that I can understand. But what's the point of feeding some seedy pigeons!? Why don't people say what they mean!? \"Get lost!\" That's what they're trying to say! Oh, yes! I'm just an inconvenience, you see! At home... At that restaurant... I just get in the way, don't I!? Phoenix: I-I'm sure you don't. (Wait a minute! What did he just say? At home and... at that restaurant?) Hold up... By \"restaurant\", are you talking about Trés Bien? Did you get asked to run an errand there, too? Kudo: Yes, I did! The very day that young brat was poisoned. Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? Leads back to Talk options The \"errand\" (appears after selecting \"Suck it up\" upon selecting \"Embroiderer\" Talk option) Phoenix: So on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do? Kudo: Glad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me. Armstrong: \"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!\" Kudo: \"Call them yourself!\" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time. Maya: So, did you end up calling the police? Kudo: Like I said, I was in a bit of a daze. Phoenix: Did you call them on your cell phone? Kudo: Kah! Do I look like I'd have one of those new-fangled thingamajigs? I went out looking for a pay phone, of course! Maya: You went looking for one...? Kudo: I couldn't find one right away, you know. Wandered around for 5 minutes or so. Maya: F-Five minutes...? Phoenix: So for five minutes after the incident happened... Kudo: Yessiree, the owner was at Trés Bien on his own. Phoenix: Why didn't you mention this in court this morning? Kudo: Well, I would have if you'd given me the chance! But you all bullied me out of the courtroom! Judge: *sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today. Kudo: WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else... Judge: Bailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom! Kudo: It's not my fault! You're the ones to blame! Phoenix: You could have at least told us before we got to court. Maya: Is it really that important that Mr. Kudo was the one who called the police...? Phoenix: (What's important is the unaccounted time before the police arrived. The victim was dead, and Maggey was unconscious. Which leaves that woman... I mean, that man, alone in the restaurant!) Mr. Kudo might have been chased out of the place on purpose. Maya: What do you mean? Phoenix: Maybe a certain someone didn't want him in the restaurant. Maya: Ah! Kudo: Oh, sure! You go ahead and say I was in the way as usual! I suppose I should've been getting myself covered in pigeon poop instead, hmm? Phoenix: (We need to get more details about what exactly happened... ...from Maggey... and from Mr. Armstrong!) The \"errand\" (subsequent times) Phoenix: So on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do? Kudo: Glad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me. Armstrong: \"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!\" Kudo: \"Call them yourself!\" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time. Maya: So, did you end up calling the police? Kudo: Like I said, I was in a bit of a daze. Phoenix: Did you call them on your cell phone? Kudo: Kah! Do I look like I'd have one of those new-fangled thingamajigs? I went out looking for a pay phone, of course! Maya: You went looking for one...? Kudo: I couldn't find one right away, you know. Wandered around for 5 minutes or so. Maya: F-Five minutes...? Phoenix: So for five minutes after the incident happened... Kudo: Yessiree, the owner was at Trés Bien on his own. Present Anything Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this? Kudo: ... Kah! Phoenix: Excuse me... Kudo: You let me get a million of my grumbles off my chest, and I'll take one quick look. I've got an earthquake of frustration inside and it's ready to rumble! Phoenix: ...On second thought, forget it. A million grumbles for one quick look doesn't sound like a good deal... for me. After clearing \"The \"errand\"\" Talk option in Vitamin Square: January 7Trés BienKitchen Maya: Looks like Mr. Armstrong's out again. Phoenix: But the place is open for business... You can't have an open restaurant without a chef! Maya: Hey! It's not my fault, Nick! Don't take it out on me! Phoenix: (Only a couple of minutes after the incident happened... Mr. Kudo left the scene, leaving Mr. Armstrong here alone.) Maya: Argh... Missing when we need to talk to him the most. Phoenix: (Maybe he's trying to avoid us on purpose?) After breaking Psyche-Lock, clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien: January 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room Byrde: Oh, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Hello, Maggey. So they finished questioning you? Byrde: Wasn't it just unbelievable in court today, sir!? I'm going to stay up all night and blog about everything that happened! Maya: Weren't you scared? It was pretty touch and go in there. Byrde: Yeah, but you totally nailed that old man! Phoenix: Well, he was all over the place with his testimony. Byrde: He's not the only one! Maya: Huh? What do you mean? Byrde: Everyone else's testimonies don't match up either. Not with what I remember of the incident, anyway... Phoenix: (Is it possible she is the one misremembering things...?) Talk Contradictions Maya: Maggey... You know how you said that everyone else... ...provided testimony that didn't match up with what you remembered? Byrde: Yup. There are just so many things that don't seem to add up. The biggest contradiction is the other guy I saw at the victim's table. HE was the one who slipped something into the victim's coffee. I'm sure it was him! Phoenix: (But didn't Mr. Kudo testify earlier today... ...that it was the waitress who put some white powder into the coffee cup...?) Maya: So you really think it was this \"disappearing man\" that did it...? Byrde: Well, he's not the only thing that disappeared. The CD vanished as well. You know, the CD with the writing on it. Maya: Oh, yeah. The \"MC Screwdriver\" album, right? Phoenix: It was \"MC Bomber\", Maya. That name was scrawled on the sports paper as well. Byrde: They never did find that CD at the crime scene, sir. Phoenix: (Or the victim's medication. That's gone missing, too.) Maya: Ouch, my head... This is getting way too complicated for me! After the incident Phoenix: You said that you passed out when the victim, Glen Elg, collapsed, right? Byrde: Yes. It's so embarrassing. I mean, I used to be a cop! When I came to, the restaurant was buzzing with police. And before I knew what was going on, they arrested me, sir. Phoenix: So between the time the victim collapsed and the time the police arrived on the scene... ...you have no idea what went on at Trés Bien. Byrde: No. No idea at all. Why? Is it important, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The other witness, the old man from the park, was pretty much chased out of the picture. Byrde: \"Chased out of the picture\"? What do you mean? Maya: Old Seedy wasn't inside the restaurant because he was told to go call the police. Phoenix: Exactly. And you, Maggey, were unconscious. That means Mr. Armstrong was alone in the restaurant for a brief period of time. Byrde: No... Y-You don't think Mr. Armstrong... set me up... do you? Phoenix: When you consider the facts... ...it's hard to imagine that Mr. Armstrong isn't involved in this at all. Byrde: Grr! It's like the master biting the paw of the dog that it feeds! Are you sure about this, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Well, the old man said as much when we spoke with him earlier. Byrde: I don't know. The things that man says don't add up for some reason, sir... Phoenix: (Maggey looks like she's trying to figure something out...) Maya: We'd better find outexactly what happened to the old man on that day. Victor's testimony (appears after presenting Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile) Phoenix: Is there anything about Mr. Kudo's testimony that stood out as odd to you? Byrde: Actually... Yes. The fact that he was even testifying to begin with doesn't quite... Maya: ...? \"Doesn't quite\" what? Byrde: Well, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant. Phoenix: (Yeah, we know that already. It was Victor Kudo.) Byrde: But I can't really say it was an old man. Maya: OK, then how about calling him a really old middle-aged man! Byrde: No, age isn't the issue. The other customer was a woman. Phoenix: A woman!? Maya: Are you sure, Maggey!? Byrde: Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I think so. Maya: So? What did this woman look like? Byrde: Umm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh. Phoenix: \"Creepy\"? Maya: \"Cackling\"? Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling I've come across a woman like that recently?) Present Sports Paper Byrde: That's the paper the victim had with him, isn't it? Maya: That's what we think, madam. Byrde: I kind of remember him having a paper, actually. And I remember something about this \"MC Bomber\", too. Maya: It was written on the CD that disappeared as well, wasn't it? Byrde: I don't suppose it makes any difference if there was one CD or two, right? Magazine Clipping Byrde: Just thinking about the trial that day gives me the creeps. Maya: Was it that bad? Phoenix: D-Don't forget that was my phony, not me! Byrde: He was supposed to say, \"Surely the defendant isn't the real criminal!\" But instead he shouted out, \"Surely the defendant is the real criminal!\" ...By mistake. Maya: Oh, ouch. Phoenix: L-Like I said, that was my phony, not me! Byrde: I...! I don't want to think about it anymore... Phoenix: (Trust me, neither do I...) Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile Byrde: Ah, I feel much better after the trial this morning. I've been a bit of a courtroom proceedings addict for years now. It feels like forever since I was a witness as slippery as that old man. Maya: He's not really that bad of an old man though. Byrde: Still, I feel a bit uneasy. Maya: Huh? I thought you just said you felt much better... Phoenix: Maggey. If there's something on your mind, you've got to tell us. Especially if it has anything to do with Mr. Kudo or his testimony. Byrde: Roger! I'll spill it all and see what you make of it! Coffee Cup Byrde: That's the cup I took over to the table, sir. But! I didn't put anything in it... I just... I could never do something like that! Maya: That's right! You could never do anything like that! Byrde: I'm not good at carrying those large trays, you know. Trying to balance a tray with one hand to put something in the coffee with the other... That'd just be asking for trouble. I'd drop something, for sure! Maya: Th-That's right! Phoenix: (...I-Is she expecting me to claim that she's too clumsy to have committed the crime...?) Apron Byrde: Oh, yeah. That's from when I was carrying a customer's breakfast over to them. Phoenix: The ketchup splotch, you mean? Byrde: My whole face was fire-engine red, thanks to that stuff. Maya: But you spilled the ketchup in your apron, didn't you? I don't see how... Byrde: The ketchup-covered omelet went flying and hit the customer in the face. Maya: Oh, talk about a tomato-red face! Makes me wish I could've seen it myself. Byrde: Yeah, I guess... It was kind of a sight to behold. Potassium Cyanide Byrde: Potassium cyanide? I've never heard of that poison before in my life, sir! Phoenix: ... Byrde: OK, maybe I have. But I've never seen it before. That's the truth. I wouldn't even know where the nearest potassium cyanide dealer is in the first place. Maya: Potassium cyanide dealers? Sounds like another group of drug pushers to avoid... Phoenix: In any case, this definitely isn't something you can pick up just anywhere. Byrde: Ooh!! Curse my rotten luck! The criminal must've stuck the bottle in my apron while I was unconscious! Gumshoe's Lunchbox Phoenix: Oh, yeah! I've got something you're going to love! Byrde: Really? What is it!? Phoenix: A lunchbox, just for you. Here! Byrde: Wow! A lunchbox! Weenies, too! I can't believe it! Thank you, sir! Did you make this just for me, Mr. Wright? Maya: Nah, it was Detective Gumshoe! Who else would make such a nice lunchbox for you? Byrde: Detective Gumshoe? Maya: He's really worried about you. Looks like he put a lot of effort into making this, too! Byrde: ... I can't accept it. Detention Center rules. No gifts allowed, sir. Phoenix: Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't be like that. Byrde: The rules are the rules! They'll lock you up if you break them. Phoenix: (Somehow, when an ex-cop turned waitress says that, it seems a whole lot scarier.) Byrde: And anyway... I hate weenies! Maya: O-Oh... really? Byrde: It's all yours, Maya! You can enjoy it with Mr. Wright! Maya: B-But... Phoenix: ... She's right... It's better than letting it go to waste. Maya: But! ...I guess so. Gumshoe's Lunchbox eaten with Maya. Byrde: ... Well? How was it? Phoenix: That hit the spot! I love weenies. Byrde: Oh, good! I'm glad I gave it to you, then, sir! Paper Badge Byrde: Ah! Is that... your attorney's badge? Phoenix: Actually, it's a fake. Byrde: Hoooly smokes! That's it!! Maya: Huh? Byrde: That's the badge your phony had, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: You got duped by this...!? Maya: But it's a completely different color! Phoenix: And what about the fact that it's made of paper!? Byrde: He said the badge got a tan as well, while he was in Hawaii on business. Phoenix: (I'm beginning to see how my phony was able to gain her trust...) Glen Elg profile Byrde: Ah! That's the victim, isn't it? Phoenix: That day was the first time you'd ever seen this man, right? Byrde: Yes. I'd never met or seen him before then. I just happened to be the waitress who served him his coffee, sir. That's all! Phoenix: It seems he was a computer programmer. Byrde: Really? I'm useless with computers. Completely hopeless. I don't know any computer programs. Phoenix: (Did she mean \"programmers\"?) Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Back when I was an officer, Detective Gumshoe always looked out for me. But today! Today I was the one who had to look out for him; trying to incriminate me the whole time! Phoenix: You've got to remember, Maggey. Gumshoe's a detective. He's got a job to do. Byrde: My old boss... I thought at least he'd be on my side. Maya: He is on your side! He'd do anything to help y-- Byrde: You can't fool me! I saw him in court today! I felt like a poor little baby woodpecker being pecked on the head by its own mother! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's testimony was pretty solid... No wonder it hurt her so much.) Byrde: I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again! Phoenix: (Ouch. I think I just saw Gumshoe's chances go down in flames like the Hindenburg...) Maya: I don't think it's getting through to her that he really was trying to help... Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Mr. Armstrong was very good to me after I was fired from the force. I can't believe someone as nice as him could have anything to do with this... Phoenix: (Well, in the time between the victim being poisoned and the police being called... ...the only person who was on the scene and had a chance to do anything... ...was Mr. Armstrong. There was no one else there.) Byrde: M-Mr. Armstrong wouldn't... He wouldn't set me up... would he!? Furio Tigre profile Byrde: Hoooly smokes! That's him!! Maya: Huh? Byrde: That's your phony, Mr. Wright! Just look at that ridiculous suntan! Phoenix: Um... For the record, I'm not sunburned like an over-dried tomato so I don't know... Byrde: He told me he'd been on a business trip to Hawaii and that's where he got the tan. Phoenix: (I'm not hearing this...) Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be in the police force. But I'm incarcerated, now. I don't pick up much information in here. All I can help you out with now is the menu at Trés Bien. Maya: Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't let your spirits fall! After examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes in Tender Lender, and clearing \"Victor's testimony\" Talk option and presenting Gumshoe's Lunchbox in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Detective: The main server just went up in smoke! Why the heck isn't the press conference set up yet!? The Superintendent's here already! Chief: Yeah. And there's a problem with the Internet, too. Detective: I already told you to stop using your computer, Chief! Chief: But I'm watching videos online! I'm catching up on my Asian soap operas! Detective: It's gonna have to wait, Chief. I'm throwing the switch! Chief: Nooo! Just when Sum Yung-Gai was about to confess to his son's hot-to-trot girlfriend! Maya: Wow! This place is really buzzing. Phoenix: Something must be going down. Something really big. Gumshoe: Huh!? What are you doing here, pal? Maya: Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: You can't be here right now. You'll be roped into the briefing if you stay. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: We've got big problems here today. Maya: Why? What's going on? Gumshoe: It's a virus! A virus!! Phoenix: (A virus?) Gumshoe: There's a virus ripping through the precinct's computer system. Phoenix: (But I really need to ask you some questions...) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Your batteries won't last forever. Remember that when you're having fun... in bed.\" We have a winner! A little joke to make people think about their smoke alarms. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a fire safety campaign... ...I guess? ...Does he even know what he's trying to get across anymore? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut. Chief: Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to read the paper now. Phoenix: (Alternately, you could read some reports... Just a suggestion.) Chief: What the heck is this!? This paper's more than a month old! And someone's written all over it! Who's the clown that put this on my desk? Well? Speak up! Maya: He just wadded it up and chucked it in the trash! Phoenix: But that's an important piece of evidence! Talk Tender Lender Gumshoe: OK, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up! Maya: Y-Yes! Gumshoe: No matter how poor you get, never borrow money from a place like this, you hear? Maya: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: If you got money trouble, just go on a diet of instant noodles and hang in there! Phoenix: Ah, we're not thinking about borrowing money, Detective! We want information. Gumshoe: Oh... Is that all? Well, let's see... Tender Lender is considered to be even fishier than the average illegal loan shark. And it seems it ran into trouble just recently. Those guys have been pretty heavy-handed, calling in all their debts. Maya: Really? Gumshoe: Don't go poking your nose around in their business, pal. You'll really regret it if you upset that lady. Phoenix: Alright, I get the picture. (Hey, wait a minute! What did he just say!? \"That lady\"?) Maya: Who's this lady he's talking about, Nick? Phoenix: (We better find out what the story is with this \"lady\"...) Computer viruses Maya: So what exactly is a computer virus, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I dunno. Maya: What? Gumshoe: Look, I just go with the flow, alright, pal? Phoenix: (And here I thought detectives were supposed to be somewhat knowledgeable...) Gumshoe: What's with that face, pal? You think you know what a virus is? Maya: Well, Nick? Do you? Phoenix: A computer virus? Sure. I mean, only in simple terms, of course. Maya: Really? Wow, you know everything. Professor Nick! Gumshoe: Yeah. I'm gonna call you Dr. Wright from now on! Maya: Hey, that sounds pretty cool! Don't you agree, Dr. Wright? Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling they're making fun of me?) OK, fine. I'm no expert, but I can at least explain the basics to the two of you. What's a virus? (appears after \"Computer viruses\") Phoenix: A virus is a program that gets inside a computer and causes damage. Gumshoe: Damage? You mean it makes the machine go \"boom\" and explode? Phoenix: No. The damage is, um... Well, it's all internal. Maya: So the inside goes \"boom\", right? Phoenix: Imagine all the case data you've got stored on your PCs here in the station... A virus could wipe out all that. That's the kind of damage I'm talking about. Maya: Whoa! That's scary. Phoenix: Yeah. And what's even more scary is that viruses are infectious. Maya: Infectious? Phoenix: Most computers are connected together on a network, right? A virus can move on machine to another over the network. So the virus just keeps spreading faster and faster. Gumshoe: Hmph. Just like a real virus, huh. Maya: But, Nick! Why would anyone want to make a program like that? Gumshoe: Yeah. It takes ages to type in all that data. Why would you wanna destroy it, pal? Phoenix: No. People don't infect their own machines. They send the virus to someone else's. Maya: What!? That's horrible! Gumshoe: Oh, I get it... It's like you sneezing on Godot so he catches a cold. Maya: Right! Then he wouldn't be able to turn up in court because he'd be too sick. You really shouldn't do stuff like that, Nick. It's wrong. Phoenix: Who? What? Where? When and why did the conversation jump to talking about me!? Anyway, that's what a computer virus is. A bad program that causes damage. Gumshoe: And all the different viruses have names, right? I kinda feel like I've heard the name of the virus we caught somewhere before. Phoenix: (The name of the virus, huh? I feel like I've heard of it before, too...) MC Bomber (appears after presenting Sports Paper or MC Bomber) Gumshoe: We already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met. Maya: Who are they? Gumshoe: I dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess. Phoenix: And now the virus has been released, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival! Maya: All this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie! Gumshoe: Apparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market. Phoenix: You mean someone put this virus up for sale? Gumshoe: Yeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal. Phoenix: (In the millions!? A virus can be worth that much!?) MC Bomber updated in the Court Record. MC Bomber (subsequent times) Gumshoe: We already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met. Maya: Who are they? Gumshoe: I dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess. Phoenix: And now the virus has been released, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival! Maya: All this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie! Gumshoe: Apparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market. Phoenix: You mean someone put this virus up for sale? Gumshoe: Yeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal. Phoenix: (In the millions!? A virus can be worth that much!?) The Cadaverinis (appears after presenting Violetta profile) Phoenix: I'm not sure if I really want to get involved in this, but who are the Cadaverinis? Gumshoe: Who are they? A scary bunch of people, that's who! Phoenix: (You're a cop, and you're scared? What's that about?) Gumshoe: Trust me, it doesn't matter if you're kid or a cop, these guys are scary. They've got some serious clout in the criminal underworld. We can't touch them. They've got too much moola. Phoenix: Moola...? As in? Gumshoe: They pretty much control all the cash on the city's black market. Phoenix: The black market, huh? And that includes Tender Lender, I take it? Gumshoe: Sure. No one stands up to Bruto Cadaverini. And I mean, no one! Phoenix: (Interesting...) Maya: So Viola's the granddaughter of some mafia boss then? Gumshoe: Yeah. And everyone know how much Bruto loves his little girl. She means everything to him. Phoenix: So... How did she end up at Tender Lender? Gumshoe: I dunno, pal. But I heard she and the boss of the Tender Lender are pretty tight. Maya: Tight? Gumshoe: That's what it said in a file I read related to Maggey's case. Phoenix: (Sounds like a pretty important clue.) Present Sports Paper or MC Bomber Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, umm... about this... Gumshoe: What!? I'm trying to concentrate on Maggey and this virus right now, so I... Aaaaaaaaaaah!! This is it! This stupid name! I remember now! Phoenix: (I thought so. Here it comes...) Maya: Don't just nod to yourself and keep me in the dark, Nick! What's going on!? Phoenix: It's OK, Maya! You don't have to cry about it! Gumshoe: The name scribbled on that sports paper and written on that CD... That's the name of the virus! \"MC Bomber\"! Maya: WHAT!? Gumshoe: Yeah! The virus that's just infected every computer in the station, pal. It's MC Bomber! Phoenix: Can you give us any more details? Please? Glen Elg profile Gumshoe: This guy was a real programming genius. They called him \"the walking computer\" at the place where he worked. Maya: What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!? Phoenix: (*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!) Gumshoe: Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim. Violetta profile Gumshoe: That's the girl who works over at Tender Lender. You wanna stay away from her, OK? I mean it. Maya: She does look kind of unforgiving, doesn't she? Gumshoe: That should be the least of your worries, pal. Phoenix: (What's that supposed to mean? What could be worse...?) Gumshoe: Her name's Viola Cadaverini. She's the only granddaughter of Bruto Cadaverini. Maya: Bruto Cadaverini? Do you know who that is, Nick? Phoenix: Never heard of him. Gumshoe: Bruto Cadaverini's the boss of the Cadaverini family. Phoenix: The Cadaverinis? (That's one scary-sounding name!) Gumshoe: We can't touch them. They're way too powerful for the police. But you're thinking of taking them on, aren't you? Phoenix: N-No! I don't remember ever saying I was going to! (I better get some more info out of Gumshoe about this \"family\"...) Furio Tigre profile Gumshoe: Oh, this guy... The Tiger... Maya: Is he famous? Gumshoe: Yeah. This guy's not a loan shark, you know. Nope. He's a big loan cat! Phoenix: Hence the name? Gumshoe: Don't pay him back, and you'd better say your prayers, because he'll eat you alive. Maya: You're shaking, Detective. Phoenix: Like a leaf... Gumshoe: I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean. Bruto Cadaverini profile Gumshoe: I wouldn't go flashing that photo around if I were you, pal. Maya: Why not? Gumshoe: That guy rules the criminal underworld. You could get yourselves in serious trouble. I'm talking say-your-prayers trouble. Maya: You're shaking, Detective. Phoenix: Like a leaf... Gumshoe: I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean. After clearing \"MC Bomber\" and \"The Cadaverinis\" Talk options: Gumshoe: Aaaaargh! I can't believe it! I almost forgot the most important thing! Phoenix: A-And that is...? Gumshoe: You know, the lunchbox! How did everything go!? Phoenix: L-Lunchbox? Maya: You remember. The weenies...? Byrde: I hate weenies! Phoenix: (Oh, yeah... Those weenies.) Gumshoe: So? How did my weenies taste when they went down the hatch? Maya: Huh? Um... Well... It was... delicious! Gumshoe: Yeah? That's what she said? Really!? Maya: Umm... Well... Not exactly... Gumshoe: Don't worry about it, pal. I figured something would happen, so I came prepared. Phoenix: Prepared? What do you mean...? Gumshoe: I made a jumbo lunchbox! Maya: Oh... Gumshoe: Do me a favor again, huh, pal, and deliver this? Phoenix: (This sure is a heavy burden... In more ways than one...) Gumshoe: I can just imagine Maggey's little eyes sparkling with joy when you bring her that! Maya: ...Weenies, again, Nick? Tell me we don't have to eat all these too... Gumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya. Again. Maya: I really can't eat any more... Present Gumshoe's Lunchbox Gumshoe: Don't forget to give that to Maggey, OK? Maya: But they don't allow presents for the prisoners in the detention center, right...? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right... ... Well it doesn't matter. I'm counting on you to get it to her somehow. Phoenix: (I'm a lawyer, not a delivery boy, Gumshoe...) Blue Screens, Inc. Talk Glen's troubles (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Basil: Glen's head had more processing power than any computer. But it had been infected with a \"gambling\" virus. Glen was... in too deep. Phoenix: You mean he was in debt? Basil: Yes. 100,000 dollars in debt. Not an easy amount to repay. So... He said he was taking on some extra work. Something a bit risky. Phoenix: \"Risky\"? How? Maya: Maybe he was going to become a waitress at Trés Bien!? Phoenix: (Where do you come up with these ideas!?) Risky extra work (appears after \"Glen's troubles\") Phoenix: So it's safe to say Mr. Elg was the creator of this virus, huh? Basil: The \"MC Bomber\" virus? Yes. It was a work of genius. In a bad sort of way, of course. But still genius. Something like that would probably fetch several million dollars on the black market. Phoenix: (Inconceivable! Gumshoe was right for a change!) This date, December 3rd, that is marked on his calendar... That was his deadline for repaying his debts. MC Bomber updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: (I guess we won't be needing these horse racing tickets any more.) Glen Elg's Losing Horse Racing Tickets thrown back on the floor. Maya: Use the trash can, Nick! Risky extra work (subsequent times) Phoenix: So it's safe to say Mr. Elg was the creator of this virus, huh? Basil: The \"MC Bomber\" virus? Yes. It was a work of genius. In a bad sort of way, of course. But still genius. Something like that would probably fetch several million dollars on the black market. Phoenix: (Inconceivable! Gumshoe was right for a change!) This date, December 3rd, that is marked on his calendar... That was his deadline for repaying his debts. Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Glen's Trouble -- Phoenix: So, how about you tell me what kind of trouble Mr. Elg was in? Basil: I'm sorry, sir, but we don't deal with trouble-shooting here. Perhaps you'd like to speak to someone in customer service? Phoenix: (What's she talking about!? I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...) Ms. Basil. Let me ask you something. Did Mr. Elg's troubles have something to do with this? Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Basil: What is that? Phoenix: A lottery ticket. There were a ton of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime. (Changed from [There were hundreds of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime.] in the original release) Basil: And what is the relevance of that? Phoenix: The victim, Mr. Glen Elg... ...had a gambling habit, didn't he? Basil: I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone dreams of being rich. Even I listen to Millionaire Radio. Phoenix: (She's right. That is a bit weak on its own.) But Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to the lottery, was it? Present Losing Horse Racing Tickets Phoenix: Leads to: \"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: Everyone likes to gamble from time to time. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: But be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc. Phoenix: (Looks like I got that one wrong.) Leads back to: \"I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts.\" Present Losing Horse Racing Tickets Phoenix: Basil: What is that? Phoenix: A bunch of horse racing tickets. All losing ones. Basil: With that many tickets, you could get 1 dollar at the recycling center. You good people are very, very bad. Cashing in on others' misfortunes is immoral. Phoenix: (...Is that a whiff of hypocrisy I smell?) (Changed from [...Why did I get a whiff of hypocrisy just now?] in the original release) Basil: But what is the relevance of these tickets? Phoenix: The victim, Mr. Glen Elg... He had a gambling habit, didn't he? Basil: I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone likes to go to the races from time to time. Phoenix: (Yeah, but not everyone buys this many tickets!) Basil: Anyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own. Phoenix: You're right. But I'm not through yet. Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to horse races, was it? Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: Everyone likes to gamble from time to time. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: But be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc. Phoenix: (Looks like I got that one wrong.) Leads back to: \"Anyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!? Basil: I'm not sure. Let's ask one of the programmers... Excuse me. Can you answer this man's query, please? Programmer: The data queue that manages system tasks for trouble-shooting requires that the multi-tasking simulation for local variables be put into sleep mode so that data transmission on active nodes can be bundled correctly according to the source code. ...Obviously. Basil: So I'm afraid that is the situation, you see. Did you good people follow all that? Phoenix: Not even slightly! What was all that mumbo-jumbo? Basil: It is exactly as my programmer explained. Phoenix: (I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.) Basil: Would you like to input another question? Leads back to: \"I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...\" Phoenix: The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times. That's got to have hurt his wallet pretty bad, don't you think? Maybe bad enough to be the cause of some pretty serious trouble perhaps!? Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Basil: You are right. Glen did have a gambling habit. You good people must not follow his example, do you understand? Phoenix: Trust me. Even if I wanted to, I don't exactly have the money to buy any. Basil: But... if you win, there's no problem, is there? And Glen had a winning ticket, didn't he? For half a million dollars? Phoenix: Yeah, but... Basil: It's hard to imagine how he could have been in trouble then, isn't it? Phoenix: It's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end. But that was his first stroke of good luck. He was in deep trouble before that. Basil: Deep trouble? What do you mean? Phoenix: Mr. Elg's real problem was with someone or something more terrifying and ferocious! Present Glen's Calendar Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Elg met with someone on the day he was killed. He even made a note on this calendar about the meeting: \"Meet with The Tiger.\" Basil: What is the relevance of that? Are you trying to suggest Glen was meeting him to discuss his debt? Phoenix: Y-Yeah. That's what I was thinking. Basil: But I have never heard anything about this \"Tiger\" before. Maybe he's not even human. Maybe he really is a tiger! Phoenix: (I'm no programmer, but does she really expect me to buy such messed up logic?) In that case, I think it's time to introduce you to The Tiger. Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\".\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!? Basil: I'm not sure. Let's ask one of the programmers... Excuse me. Can you answer this man's query, please? Programmer: The data queue that manages system tasks for trouble-shooting requires that the multi-tasking simulation for local variables be put into sleep mode so that data transmission on active nodes can be bundled correctly according to the source code. ...Obviously. Basil: So I'm afraid that is the situation, you see. Did you good people follow all that? Phoenix: Not even slightly! What was all that mumbo-jumbo? Basil: It is exactly as my programmer explained. Phoenix: (I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.) Basil: Glen had a lot of friends, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"But I have never heard anything about this \"Tiger\" before.\" Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Phoenix: Furio Tigre... The boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\". Basil: \"Tender Lender\"!? People with businesses should think harder before naming their offices. Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk!) Well? What do you think? Basil: Our firm is doing very well at the moment. I don't think we need to borrow money. Phoenix: No, no, no! I mean about Mr. Elg! Basil: You think Glen had something to do with this Furio Tigre? Phoenix: Yes... Basil: I'm sorry. I don't know of any connection between the two of them. Phoenix: (Really? Because I've got proof that Mr. Elg and The Tiger knew each other.) Present Glen's Calendar Phoenix: Leads to: \"Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\".\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!? Basil: I'm not sure. Let's ask one of the programmers... Excuse me. Can you answer this man's query, please?

Basil: So I'm afraid that is the situation, you see. Did you good people follow all that? Phoenix: Not even slightly! What was all that mumbo-jumbo? Basil: It is exactly as my programmer explained. Phoenix: (I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.) Basil: Glen had a lot of friends, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"You think Glen had something to do with this Furio Tigre?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: All good people get into trouble sometimes. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: Let's ask one of my programmers what they think... Excuse me? What do you think? Programmer: I'm taking a break. Basil: Yes. Perhaps I should take a break, too. Phoenix: (I wish I could take a break from my troubles, but the rest stop was about a mile back.) Leads back to: \"It's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end.\" Phoenix: Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\". This is who Mr. Elg met with on the day of his murder. And the only thing a loan shark would talk with him about would be his debt! Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Basil: It's true that Glen had racked up quite a bit of debt from his gambling habit. About 100,000 dollars, I think. Phoenix: (100,000 dollars? Ouch!) Basil: But I heard he won the lottery, so he should have been in the clear. Phoenix: (Shame Maggey couldn't get a bit of that good luck.) OK... ...So the guy got lucky and won the lottery. But what if he hadn't won? What was his plan then? Basil: Well... This isn't easy to say, but... He said he would use his talents to repay the money. Phoenix: His \"talents\"? Basil: I suspect he was talking about programming. Phoenix: Wh-What computer program is worth 100,000 dollars!? Basil: ... Perhaps you good people should leave so I can get back to my work. Phoenix: (I'm so close to cracking her!) The program in question... Was it by any chance... this!? Present MC Bomber (after clearing \"MC Bomber\" Talk option in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Well? This is it, isn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: This is a very delicate matter. Without the necessary data, there's really no way I can access the information. Phoenix: (I know Mr. Elg created some sort of program! She can't deny it if I show her the program itself as evidence!) Leads back to: \"I'm so close to cracking her!\" Phoenix: Well? This is it, isn't it? This is the virus that's infecting computers world-wide as we speak... \"MC Bomber\"! Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Tender Lender Talk The head bandage (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Viola: Four months ago... I was in a traffic accident... That's why I needed the operation... When I woke up... they told me it was nothing serious... A simple procedure... Maya: Oh! Really? Phoenix: (Well, I guess if she recovered in 4 months, it couldn't have been too big...) Viola: They said the operation... cost one million dollars... Maya: A... A... A million bucks!? Viola: My grandfather ordered Don Tigre to pay... One million dollars... In \"compensation\"... Maya: \"Compensation\", huh...? Phoenix: It's underworld lingo for paying money to settle a score. Basically, pay or get into some serious trouble! (But a million bucks!? This has to be related to our poisoning case somehow...) Compensation (appears after \"The head bandage\") Leads to: \"I wanted to believe him... I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said...\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Head Bandage -- Phoenix: You said that bandage around your head was from an operation? Viola: ... Phoenix: You also said you suffered a \"fatal injury\" to the head, correct? Viola: Yes... The operation was very... difficult, apparently... Phoenix: Now, by \"fatal injury\", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right? Viola: ... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: Did the injury in question have something to do with this? Present Repair Bill Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have here a car repair bill.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Viola: Donuts...? Phoenix: Huh? Viola: I baked them myself... Home-made donuts... Have one... Phoenix: Umm, what's inside? Viola: Jam, and... ... Phoenix: I'm sorry, but I didn't quite catch that... Viola: Hee... Hee... Phoenix: Um... Thanks, but no thanks... I think I'll pass. (I guess that was a flop. What happened to this woman for her to have such a huge bandage around her head? There must be some piece of evidence that'll prompt her to tell me what happened...) Leads back to: \"Now, by \"fatal injury\", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right?\" Phoenix: I have here a car repair bill. From this, it seems pretty obvious that this car was involved in an accident. Viola: Let me see that... ... This bill is made out to the \"Cadaverinis\"...? Phoenix: Y-Yes, it is. Viola: I don't think... I ever introduced myself... Tell me... what do the \"Cadaverinis\"... have to do with me...? Phoenix: (Something tells me she's not about to say hi and introduce herself... Alright, then...) Your relationship with the Cadaverinis is very strong... And this is why. Present Viola Cadaverini or Bruto Cadaverini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I know exactly who you are, Viola Cadaverini!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: So!? What do have to say for herself now!? Viola: Pretzels... For you... Phoenix: Huh? Viola: Don't worry about the little white specks on the surface... I just sprinkled a small quantity of... ... Phoenix: ...N-No thanks! (My evidence must still be half-baked...) Viola: I really don't know... the \"Cadaverinis\"... Further... Leads back to: \"I don't think... I ever introduced myself...\" Phoenix: I know exactly who you are, Viola Cadaverini! You sustained that injury in a traffic accident, didn't you? Viola: ... 1 LOCK BROKEN Viola: It happened about 4 months ago... I was driving in one of our family's cars... when someone pulled out in front of me... It was a motorbike... or something like that... I don't remember it much... Anyway, I swerved to try to avoid it, but... ...I took a blow... to the head... A bad one. Phoenix: (Yeah, I can imagine...) So what happened to the person on the bike? I'm guessing they didn't get away with injuring THE Viola Cadaverini, right? Viola: I... don't know... what happened to them... They ran away... Or so I heard... Phoenix: Ran away? Viola: If they'd stayed, I'd have... Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: (Hmm, is it possible...? Could the person who committed the hit and run have been...?) Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was this man, wasn't it? He was the cause of your accident.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: The person who caused the accident that gave you that injury was-- Viola: No more.. I don't want to... think about it anymore... Here... try one of these tomatoes... We all picked them together... as a family... And I added my own, special, flavoring... Phoenix: N-No thanks! (The person who caused the accident was riding a motorbike... Who could it be?) Leads back to: \"Hmm, is it possible...? Could the person who committed the hit and run have been...?\" Phoenix: It was this man, wasn't it? He was the cause of your accident. Viola: ... It wasn't Don Tigre! I refuse to believe it! 1 LOCK BROKEN Viola: We collided... The motorbike, and my car... But Don Tigre isn't injured at all... is he? Phoenix: (It was The Tiger who caused Viola to crash. I can feel it! Plus, one of her locks just broke, so she must suspect it was him, too...) I'm sorry, Ms. Cadaverini... But I have proof that The Tiger was involved in a traffic accident on his bike! Present Scooter Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's not exactly a motorbike, but...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: And this is my proof! Viola: Hard-boiled eggs...? Please, try one... Phoenix: E-Eggs? Viola: I raised the chickens and these eggs came from myself... I invented a special diet... so their chicks would be blue... Phoenix: N-No, thanks! Leads back to: \"It was The Tiger who caused Viola to crash. I can feel it!\" Phoenix: It's not exactly a motorbike, but... ...Mr. Tigre rides around in a scooter, doesn't he? And you'll notice that the front wheel guard is badly damaged. Viola: ... Phoenix: Ms. Cadaverini... You know the truth, don't you? Viola: ... Hee... Hee... Hee... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: This repair bill was paid by Furio Tigre. The Cadaverinis have known for ages who caused the accident, haven't they? Viola: ... It's possible... Perhaps... Somewhere inside me... I know that may be true... Phoenix: (I knew it...) Viola: But... Don Tigre still saved my life... The operation was very complicated... It was very, very expensive... Phoenix: How much are we talking? Viola: ... Very, very, very expensive... Phoenix: (She seems kind of hesitant about giving me an actual figure. I should back off...) Well, anyway, it was The Tiger who paid for it, right? Viola: After I recovered... Don Tigre told me... He said he paid for the operation because... he cared about me... I... believe him... Phoenix: Really? But do you honestly believe that to be true? Viola: ... Phoenix: Do you want to know what I think...? I think the reason he paid the operation wasn't because of you, but someone else... Present Bruto Cadaverini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Perhaps I shouldn't be saying this, but...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: I know this must be quite a shock for you, but... Viola: Overcoat...? Phoenix: S-Sorry? Viola: I made it myself... It's been so... cold lately... Phoenix: (Yeah, just hearing your voice sends shivers down my spine!) Viola: Please, try it on... ... ...Oops! Phoenix: ... What was the \"oops\" for? Viola: I'm missing a few pins... I must have left them in the coat... Phoenix: O-On second thought, I'm fine, thanks! Roasty-toasty, that's me! Viola: Don Tigre told me, you see... Leads back to: \"He said he paid for the operation because... he cared about me...\" Phoenix: Perhaps I shouldn't be saying this, but... ...your grandfather, Bruto Cadaverini, controls a lot of \"dubious\" cash, right? And you are his beloved pride and joy. Viola: ... Phoenix: Sure, I don't know exactly how much the operation cost, but... ...if you weren't the granddaughter of Mr. Cadaverini... ...do you think Mr. Tigre would have paid the money? Viola: ... One million dollars... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Bruto Cadaverini profile Phoenix: This man is your grandfather, right? Viola: Carrying a picture like that around with you... You should watch your back... Phoenix: Th-Thanks for the advice... Viola: The family is always watching me... from the shadows... Phoenix: (The \"family\"?) Maya: I thought I saw something suspicious under the corner of that rug! Viola: One wrong move and... you might disappear forever... Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: (This feels like Halloween... Only a whole lot more real... And a whole lot scarier, too.) Viola: I wanted to believe him... I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said... He said it had nothing to do with my grandfather being Bruto Cadaverini... I wanted to believe he helped me because he cared about me. Not about my grandfather... But I knew... That wasn't really true... Maya: Wow. I'm so sorry. Viola: What he did to get the money was... It was... evil! Phoenix: ...! Viola: He said it was all for me... So I... I helped him... Maya: You helped him? In what way? Viola: Here... Take these... Phoenix: (What are these? Medical papers?) Viola: I'm Bruto Cadaverini's granddaughter... He had to pay compensation... He was made an offer... He simply... couldn't... refuse. Viola's Medical Papers added to the Court Record. Maya: Wow, I feel so bad for Viola. Phoenix: It's inexcusable! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: (There are two things that I consider inexcusable. Poisoning, and betrayal! Only a coward would hurt people using either of these tactics.) Maya: Is everything alright, Nick? Phoenix: We should get going. Right after we finish our espresso. Maya: Yeah. Phoenix: (I wouldn't need to convince Viola of anything else, so I guess I can get rid of this.)

I ain't never seen that young kid before! Judge: ...I do believe the witness's last statement was important. Um... Mr. Godot, if you could please... Godot: Mr. Tigre.

That's very admirable of you, witness. Tigre: Yeah, well. Tender Lender's motto is \"Win Through Compromise\" ya know. Judge: \"Win Through Compromise\"? What is that supposed to mean?

The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Evidence 15 (Apron) and Evidence 18 (Victor's Note and Testimony) are contradictory. Victor Kudo testified that the victim was served by a waitress whom he only saw from behind and described only the straps and ribbon of the apron, but could not confirm seeing the waitress's face in front or recognize her clearly. The Apron (Evidence 15) is specifically identified as that worn by Maggey Byrde, the defendant, which implies that Victor Kudo should have seen Maggey from the front if he truly witnessed the poisoning. However, in testimony 18, Victor Kudo is unsure or contradicts whether he saw the waitress's face clearly. This shows that the testimony and the existence of the apron conflict regarding identification.\n\nHowever, we are asked for one pair of evidence and testimony. Looking further:\n\nEvidence 13 (Coffee Cup) and Testimony 0 of Tigre are contradictory. Tigre testifies that he \"doesn't know nothin' about no murder,\" but the Coffee Cup evidence shows he is linked as he was at Tender Lender and is suspected by Phoenix and others. But this is less of a direct contradiction and more of denial.\n\nAnother prominent contradiction is between Evidence 10 (Glen's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 7 (Victor Kudo), which says the victim drank coffee with his left hand, but the Coffee Cup shows the stain indicating the victim used his right hand.\n\nEven more precise is:\n\n- Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup): The coffee cup has a stain on the rim which shows the victim drank with his right hand.\n\n- Testimony 7 (Victor Kudo's Witness Testimony -- Left Hand or Right Hand): Victor Kudo insists that the victim drank with his left hand.\n\nThis is a direct contradiction between physical evidence and eyewitness testimony.\n\nHence, the best pair is:\n\nEvidence 13 and Victor Kudo's testimony about the victim holding the cup in his left hand.\n\nWe don't have numerical testimony IDs for Victor Kudo, but since we need to provide the numerical testimony from the list, we are given the testimonies only from Tigre.\n\nSince the list only labels testimonies 0 to 4 for Tigre, but we want to pick testimonies about Victor Kudo, which are not enumerated as testimonies but are in evidence 18 \"Victor's Note\" and \"Victor's Testimony\", or \"Victor's Testimony\" as a separate entry.\n\nTherefore, from the provided list, probably the best is to pick Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup) contradiction with Victor Kudo's testimony (Evidence 18 \"Victor's Note\" and \"Victor's Testimony\").\n\nGiven the instructions to only provide one pair and end with JSON identifying the evidence and testimony numbers, and from the lists:\n\nEvidences have IDs from 0 to 27.\n\nTestimonies have IDs 0 to 4 - all related to Tigre.\n\nHence, to pick another testimony (maybe we match evidence 18 \"Victor's Testimony\" to testimony 0 of Tigre). But that doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, the only testimonies given with IDs are for Tigre (testimonies 0 to 4), and evidences are given in 0 to 27.\n\nTherefore, the only pairs possible to select are among these.\n\nLooking at Tigre's testimonies:\n\n- Testimony 2: \"The day youse talkin' about, I was in de office, too. I never saw that kid before.\"\n\nBut evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) says he met with The Tiger on the day of the incident.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) and Testimony 2 (Tigre says he never saw that kid) contradict.\n\nTherefore, that is a clear contradiction between evidence and testimony.\n\nHence, the best pair is Evidence 20 and Testimony 2.\n",

This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. I-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me! Judge: The evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee. No! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me? Payne: Well... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!? Judge: This court finds the defendant... Guilty Judge: The court is adjourned. January 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Ahh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world! Phoenix: I bet it does, Maya. Maya: So! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think? Phoenix: Sure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake. Maya: Never! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game. ???: HEY, PAL! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... Maya: Happy New Year, Detective! Gumshoe: Uh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA... Maya: Here's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation! Gumshoe: Um... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO... Maya: Have you got a holiday present for me, Detective? Gumshoe: A what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but... Maya: Yay! Thanks! Gumshoe: LOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT! Maya: Hey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you? Gumshoe: Ah... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose? Maya: Ha ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year? Gumshoe: Very funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this! Phoenix: What is it? A magazine? Maya: Hey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\" Phoenix: Tr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!? Gumshoe: It's a report, pal. About you! Maya: Listen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\" Gumshoe: WELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it! Phoenix: But I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway? Gumshoe: Umm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month. Maya: Which makes it old news, you mean. Phoenix: But I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December! Maya: Hmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick? Gumshoe: If it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility... Maya: No way. You don't mean... Phoenix: A pho... Maya: A phony Nick!? Phoenix: (This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...) Magazine Clipping added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: SO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!? Phoenix: What do you mean, what am I going to do about it? Maya: Well, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case! Phoenix: My fault!? How do you figure that? Maya: Because THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of... Gumshoe: Yeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves? Phoenix: (But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...) Gumshoe: You better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it? Maya: Sounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto! Phoenix: I don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned. Maya: ... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year. Gumshoe: So you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!? Phoenix: (I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least pretend to read them once in a while. Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's sort of a keepsake... something to remember Mia by. Sure, the office is a mess, but I never forget to water this little fella. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so it's still super neat and tidy from when Pearls cleaned it. Movie poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I have to check it out one of these days. Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they bought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called \"Gatewater Land\". ...I wonder if that bellboy is going to send me a greeting card this year, too? Talk What to do Maya: So, what's our first move? Phoenix: I guess we go down to the detention center and talk-- Maya: Wait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right? Phoenix: Hey, hey! Let's get one thing straight. It wasn't me, it was a fake me that did this! Maya: Hmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean. Phoenix: (I hope not. *shudder* ...And what kind of name for an evil double is Xin Eohp anyway!?) Maya: Ah! Nick! I've got it! Phoenix: If you're going to ask whether I've got a twin brother, the answer is no. Maya: ...Spoilsport. Any ideas Maya: Did you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me? Phoenix: What do you mean? Maya: I mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess he was acting kind of strange. Maya: Maybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick! Phoenix: ... Considering how we interact, I seriously doubt that, Maya... Maya: Well, if he wasn't nervous because of you... Phoenix: ...then maybe it's because of our new guilty client? Present Attorney's Badge Maya: So you've still got that badge, I see. Phoenix: Huh!? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I? Maya: Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job. Phoenix: (...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.) Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe you've got an impersonator. Phoenix: I can't either. *sigh* Maya: Aww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people impersonating them! Phoenix: This isn't funny, Maya. It's not just an impersonation. This guy stole my identity! And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result. Maya: ...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick? Phoenix: (...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day. Phoenix: ...That's called \"taking a shower\". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it's because Maya's at a loss these days...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia helped me out in court again last time. Maya: It's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that. Phoenix: Yeah... Maya: We mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis... Phoenix: ...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don't we just have Pearls call her? Maya: No... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her. Phoenix: (I guess Maya's got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.) Godot profile Maya: So you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh? Phoenix: I already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much. Maya: Well he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter. Phoenix: You're just making that up, Maya! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: Digging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it? Phoenix: No. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him. Maya: Yeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears! Phoenix: (Did you mean he \"gets paid dirt\" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?) Any other evidence Phoenix: Do you know anything about this, Maya? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) Any other profile Phoenix: Do you know anything about this person? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everyone, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this individual. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: It's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick? Phoenix: Looks like Gumshoe isn't around. Maya: He's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work! Phoenix: No, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case. Maya: Guess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh? Phoenix: After being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Don't die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!\" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that's the key. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Desks Phoenix: These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks. Poster Phoenix: A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT! Mask☆DeMasque turned up at the bank? What's he doing!? \"Hands up, you scalawags!\" \"You're under arrest!\" Hey! That's our job! Phoenix: (Looks like Ron DeLite's opted for a new career.) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\", right Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Umm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: This is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...? Phoenix: K-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me! ???: Aaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying. Phoenix: A-Aren't... you... ???: Yes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down! Maya: Aah! You're... Are you...? ??? Don't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Maggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt-- Byrde: Oh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!? Maya: You better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick. Byrde: O-Oh... I see... Phoenix: So that's where we stand right now. Maya: I'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder... Byrde: My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures. Phoenix: (I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...) Byrde: But I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir! Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. I bet they don't get too many waitresses in here. He looks like he's getting a bit restless. Talk Maggey Byrde Maya: So, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform. Byrde: Hmph. I was fired after that... incident last year. Maya: Oh. I'm sorry. Byrde: It's OK. I don't mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on. Maya: So, what do you do now? Byrde: In the second act of \"The Life of Maggey Byrde\", I'm playing the role of a waitress! Maya: A waitress!? Byrde: Yes. In a French restaurant. It's a small place, but it's quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir. Phoenix: And then you got into this mess straight away, right? Byrde: Yeah, you could put it that way... What happened Byrde: This whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Trés Bien. Maya: \"Treh Bee-an\"...? Byrde: Yes. It's a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included! Maya: Oh... Byrde: There were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim's cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out. Maya: Hey, hold on there, Maggey. Byrde: What? Maya: You keep calling the guy, \"the victim\". Didn't you know the guy who was killed? Byrde: Not at all! I'd never even seen the guy before! Maya: Oh... Phoenix: (So she wouldn't have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right? Byrde: Of course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele. Phoenix: So, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come? Byrde: ......... You tell me, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ack! (Guess the answer to my question is \"my phony\"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.) Guilty verdict (appears after \"What happened\") Maya: So, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted? Byrde: Because no one else saw. Maya: Saw what? Byrde: The other man. The one who put the poison in the victim's coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. \"The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time.\" Phoenix: But how's that possible? Byrde: I don't know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could've done a better job! Phoenix: Look! That wasn't me, OK? Byrde: And then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket. Maya: What? Byrde: A small bottle... of poison. Maya: WHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!? Byrde: Well, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must've slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious. Phoenix: And no one else saw this other guy? Byrde: No, sir. That's what everyone said. But I don't see how they could've missed him... The other guy (appears after \"Guilty verdict\") Byrde: I was the one who took the coffee to the two men. Phoenix: O-Oh...? And what was your impression of them? Byrde: Well... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry. Maya: In music? How come? Byrde: Well, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician's look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Maya: An earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all? Byrde: It had a band's name written on it. I think it was \"MC\"-something. They must've been preparing for their debut, I guess. Phoenix: So it was a band's CD. Maybe a promo disc? Maya: Maybe it was \"MC Screwdriver\"! Phoenix: Get serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that? Byrde: Nngh... What was the name of that group again...? \"MC Hacksaw...\"? No... \"MC...\" Maya: And what about the killer? What did he look like? Byrde: Well, I, um... I don't really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really. Present Attorney's Badge Byrde: That badge! Is it real? Phoenix: Of course it's real! Byrde: That's what they all say. But I've been duped before. Give it to me for a sec! Phoenix: Ah...! ...*chomp!* Maya: She... She bit into it... Byrde: And I left a few teeth marks, too! Phoenix: I can see that... Byrde: I just wish I could remember if that means it's real or a fake. Phoenix: *sigh* (I said it was real!) Magazine Clipping Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I need to ask you about this... Byrde: Hey! This article's about my case! Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me? Byrde: Yes, sir! It was the morning after I'd been arrested... I met you in the visitor's room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits. Phoenix: Me? Byrde: Yes, you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Argh... Maya: Hey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too? Byrde: No. I don't remember a phony you, Maya. Maya: Oh... *sigh* It would've been so cool... Byrde: Then you got really worked up and passionate. \"I'm gonna get you' cleared'a dis crime!\" you said. (Changed from ['I'm gonna get you cleared of this crime!' you said.] in the original release) Phoenix: OK, I get the picture. But you've met me in person before... So how come you didn't realize that guy wasn't the real me? Byrde: ... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange... Phoenix: Only a little? Byrde: Well, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And... Phoenix: So the guy was nothing like me, then!? Byrde: But he had your spiky hair and blue suit. Phoenix: (... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?) Maya: How about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter? Byrde: Everyone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir. Maya: This case just keeps getting weirder and weirder... Maya Fey profile Byrde: Thanks for your help last year! Maya: Aw, it was nothing. I'm glad we got you off the hook. Byrde: I hope you can help me out this year, too! Maya: Yeah, me too. It's be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned. Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Oh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force! Phoenix: Have you seen him recently? Byrde: No. He's never been to the restaurant. Maya: Guess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all. Byrde: Yeah, he prefers the simple things in life. Phoenix: (...Or he's just simply too poor to afford anything else.) Maggey Byrde profile Byrde: No matter what happens, I never let anything get me down! Maya: You're always so positive, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! The early Byrde catches the worm! A Byrde in the hand! Maya: Wow! All those phrases are named after you? Byrde: And I never turn my back on anything! Maya: You're always so strong, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! I'm a tough old Byrde! Maya: \"Tough old byrde\", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it? Phoenix: ...Yeah, I get it. Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be on the police force, sir. But I'm incarcerated, now. So I can't use my connections to help you. All I can tell you about now is info about ex-cons or the clientele of Trés Bien, sir... Maya: Aww, don't let it get you down, Maggey! After clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping: Byrde: Mr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial? Phoenix: Probably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial. Byrde: Um... Mr. Wright...? Phoenix: ? Byrde: Do you think we'll win next time? ...Sir? Phoenix: ...! Byrde: My life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck! Maya: Argh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this! Phoenix: Wh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!) Maya: We'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you! Byrde: Thank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then! Phoenix: Trés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place. Byrde: Yes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi! Maya: Sure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food! January 6Trés Bien Maya: Wow! Look at this place. Phoenix: \"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right? Maya: Actually, I'm not all that into it... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here. Phoenix: Don't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here! Maya: Perfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want! Phoenix: (Yeah, I suppose we can...) Examine Cash register Maya: Look, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money. Phoenix: You know, you're the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way! Trinkets Maya: Look at all the little trinkets tucked away in here. Phoenix: I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let's see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups! Maya: ... I never knew you were so... cultured. Phoenix: Come on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much! Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? It'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then. Phoenix: Hm? There's something stuffed in behind the rack. Maya: ...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. \"MC Bomber\", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe? Phoenix: I wonder what \"MC Bomber\" is supposed to be...? ! (This paper! It's from December 3rd...) This paper's from the day of the poisoning! Maya: WHAT!? Sports Paper added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...) Magazine rack (subsequent times) Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Looks like Mr. Armstrong doesn't get any newspapers. Maya: Well, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it? Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" like in these mags, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Phoenix: (We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I'd better try to find out everything I can about it...) Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: What do you think this flower is, Nick? Phoenix: Let's see... Well, it doesn't look like a tulip, and it's not a sunflower, I don't think... Maya: Duh. Even I could've told you that. Phoenix: Well, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I'm a lawyer, not a botanist! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got you! I was only kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Crime scene Phoenix: This must be the table where the murder occurred. Maya: I guess so, with all this police tape all around it. Phoenix: And that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don't go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya? Maya: Why would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know! Phoenix: (Then why can I picture you doing just that?) Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Sports Paper Maya: Hmm... \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: There's something about that name, \"MC Bomber\". Phoenix: Yeah, It's a pretty unusual name. Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: Everyone's worried about bombs these days, I guess. Phoenix: I'm not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...) Maya: Anyway, we should really look into this some more! Maggey Byrde profile Maya: This is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then. Maya: Wasn't she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We're gonna get her off the hook or I'll give up hamburgers! Detention Center Present Sports Paper Byrde: Oh! A sports paper. Let's see, let's see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title? Phoenix: Sorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It's from the day of the murder... Maya: And Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid. Byrde: Oh, no... Phoenix: I found this paper in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Byrde: Really? That's strange... Trés Bien doesn't get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he's not really fond of them. Maya: Then maybe one of the customers left it behind? Phoenix: Anyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here. Byrde: Ah-ha! That's it, sir! \"MC Bomber\"! That was the name that was written on the CD! Phoenix: (Just as I thought...) Maya: I guess it wasn't \"MC Screwdriver\" after all, huh... Byrde: So, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right? Maya: If someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! \"The Master of Kurain\" or \"The Spirit Song\" or even \"Maya's Theme\"! Phoenix: Um, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim's table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim! Maya: You're right! Phoenix: (So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...) Maya: I think we better step up the investigation, don't you Nick? After presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 6Trés Bien ???: Oh là là! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Trés Bien! Maya: Oh! Hel... lo... ... Phoenix: (What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...) ???: Bienvenue! Welcome to my petite restauranté! Maya: Huh? \"Bee Avenue\"? ???: Oh, non, my petite chulip! Maya: Huh? Me? ???: Look at z'is face! Like la kitten rejected by its own mother. You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil mélange of la néroli and la rose. My personal recommendation! Maya: You think I need what...? ???: Oui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voilá! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique! Maya: Really? ???: And for la monsieur! Phoenix: Who? Me? ???: Look at z'at face! Like la puppy rejected by life itself! You are fatigued, non? For you, monsieur, I recommend z'is! Oil of bergamot. And maybe a 'int of... Oui, oui! I will add la peppermint and la clary sage for a fragrance exceptionnel! Such an invigorating recipe will bring out your delicious beauty, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My beauty!? ???: Alors. If you will be seated, I will bring you la special menu of z'e day! Phoenix: Actually, we're not here to eat. We're lawyers. ???: Mais bien sûr! I know z'is already, monsieur. You are la Phoenix Wright, non? Phoenix: Um, yes... You know me? ???: Mais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court! Maya: I guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp... Phoenix: It looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already. Maya: I wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you? Armstrong: Allow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté! Talk Trés Bien Maya: So what does \"Trés Bien\" mean? I know \"trés\". That means \"three\", right? Armstrong: Non, non, non! \"Trés Bien\" is Français! In English, you would say, \"Very Good\". Maya: Oh. Very good... Armstrong: Oui, exactement! La atmosphere is trés bien, and la cuisine is trés bien! Phoenix: (If the food's good, why aren't there any customers in here?) Armstrong: My cuisine is not for all. Some people, z'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine. Phoenix: (I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...) Armstrong: Since I 'ave lost Maggey, I do not 'ave enough 'ands. Phoenix: So, you're running this place on your own now? Armstrong: Oui. For la moment. No one 'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi! Phoenix: (... Please don't eyeball me while you say that.) Armstrong: I am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist. Maya: A roaming what? Armstrong: A practitioner d'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z'e delicate floral aromas. Phoenix: (Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...) What happened Phoenix: So, could you tell me what you know about the incident? Armstrong: Bien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z'an a month 'as passed since it 'appened. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess it's been about a month since Maggey's sentencing...) Armstrong: So. It was z'e third of last month. Just after one in z'e afternoon. A man who was in 'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill. Phoenix: Because of the poison in his coffee? Armstrong: Z'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took 'is drink to 'im. I was in la kitchen. I 'eard z'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, 'e was already slumped in 'is chair. Maya: He was dead? Armstrong: Mon dieu! Oui! 'E was dead! Maggey 'ad passed out also. Phoenix: And this man who died... Was he alone? Armstrong: Oui, monsieur. All alone. I know z'at Maggey said z'ere was someone else, but... Maya: I see... Armstrong: La police, z'ey asked me many times. \"Are you sure z'ere was no one else at z'e table?\" z'ey asked. But I am not z'e only one. La old man said z'e same thing. Phoenix: Old man? What old man? Old man (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Um... So who is the old man that you mentioned? Armstrong: At z'e time of la murder, z'ere was another customer in 'ere. Maya: What!? Someone else saw it? Armstrong: Mais, oui! As usual, 'e came alone z'at day. At z'e time of la murder, 'e was 'ere. 'E saw it, too. But 'e said z'e same thing, z'at z'ere was no one else at la victim's table. Maya: But Maggey swears there were two people! Armstrong: Mais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, 'e could not prove z'is, non? Phoenix: About the lawyer. That was me, I suppose? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr! Phoenix: ... Wow! He's the first person who's said it wasn't me. Maya: Don't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!? Maggey's motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile) Phoenix: When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen? Armstrong: Ou... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so. Phoenix: So what happened? Armstrong: Non. It was, er... It was nothing. Maya: Look, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive! Armstrong: Oui. It is true. Phoenix: If there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant. Maya: So please! Tell us anything you know. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock!?] in the original release) Maya: No way! What are we going to do, Nick? Phoenix: We'll just have to remov... WHAT THE!? Maya: Wh-What's wrong? Phoenix: The Magatama... It's gone! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: I had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air! Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (But I could see the Psyche-Locks. (Changed from [But I could see the Psyche-Lock.] in the original release) Maybe that means the Magatama's nearby...?) Maggey's motive (subsequent times) Phoenix: Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim. 3 PSYCHE LOCKS Armstrong: N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qué será, será. Perhaps Maggey 'ad another reason. Phoenix: (What's Maggey's motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock [sic] must mean it's nearby.) Maya: I only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK? Phoenix: (...And here I thought it was mine to keep!) Present Attorney's Badge Armstrong: Please, monsieur. Z'ere is no need to show me z'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z'e worst defense lawyer in town. Phoenix: (I think I can imagine how he formed this completely wrong impression of me...) Um, the last time we met, did I show you this badge? Armstrong: Oui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant! Maya: Looks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick! Magazine Clipping Armstrong: I am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z'at day was a little, how you say, \"lacking\", per'aps? Phoenix: *sigh* Armstrong: Even a Frenchman who cannot speak any English could 'ave done a better job! You were very cool, though. Oh, oui, oui! So 'andsome. Maya: Wow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been... Armstrong: Every time you opened your mouth, z'e 'ole courthouse stirred. Phoenix: (Oh, man. That is something I don't want to imagine...) Sports Paper Phoenix: We found this sports paper in the magazine rack here. Armstrong: One of my customers must 'ave left it behind. Maya: Do you have any idea which customer it was? Armstrong: Z'e only ideas I 'ave, mademoiselle, I save for my kitchen! Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: If you want a job 'ere, it is yours, precious! Mia Fey profile Armstrong: Mon dieu! What beauty! Maya: That's my sister! Armstrong: Ah, oui? Another delight! But you 'ave a certain je ne sais quois z'at I do not sense from your sister. Maya: I do? Armstrong: So throw your head 'ead 'igh! Thrust out your feminine features! Do not lose 'eart, ma fille! You are a woman! A woman extraordinaire! Maya: Do I look like I need cheering up or something? Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Maggey was a policewoman once, n'est-ce pas? Phoenix: Yes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control. Armstrong: Oui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non? Maya: Oh... You know about that? Armstrong: Z'at is why I gave to 'er la perfume for la 'appiness. Phoenix: Happiness perfume? Armstrong: Oui. Blended from bergamot, like I 'ave given to you before. Phoenix: But she's been arrested again. And found guilty this time. Armstrong: Z'is is true. 'Er natural aroma of un'appiness must 'ave been very strong. Phoenix: (Just admit it! Your perfume doesn't work!) Armstrong: I am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z'at took place before my very eyes. Maya: Something like what? Phoenix: (What's this guy talking about!?) Maya: Does this mean... Maggey did have a motive? Phoenix: We've got to ask this guy for more info, stat! Jean Armstrong profile Armstrong: It is 'ard to imagine, I know, but I was an apprentice for five years in la gay Paris. Maya: Wow! In Paris!? Armstrong: It was something la chef z'ere said to me z'at made me decide to open my own restaurant. Phoenix: What was it? Armstrong: Z'at awful man said to me, \"You must train for another ten years!\" Oh! It was such a shock! So unexpected! But you would 'ave to be a fool to do z'is, non? Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Armstrong: Félicitations! Mais... qu'est-ce que c'est? Phoenix: Ack! Um... Je... Je no comprehend... Maya: Nick! Don't just make something up! After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there? Armstrong: ... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves. Maya: Huh? \"'Im\"? Armstrong: La old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc. Phoenix: La p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that? Armstrong: Behind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\". Maya: Thank you! Armstrong: Je vous en prie, my dear! Maya: Let's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick! January 6Vitamin Square Maya: So this is Vitamin Square. Phoenix: Yeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you. Maya: Hey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about? Phoenix: That grouchy-looking grandpa? Maya: He's throwing seeds out for the pigeons. Phoenix: Maya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them! Old Man: ... Phoenix: (Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...) Examine Sandbox Maya: I used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe! Phoenix: Really? You? Maya: Sure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do. Phoenix: Iron filings? Wow... That's too exciting for words. Maya: It was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then! Phoenix: So, did you manage to get all the iron? Maya: No, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them? Phoenix: No. Fruit attractions Maya: This place is so fruity! Phoenix: That's not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They're among my favorites. Maya: Then that apple slide is perfect for you! Phoenix: ... And what is so \"perfect\" about it? Maya: Oh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo! Phoenix: No way! I'd get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that. Maya: Yeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too. Pigeons Maya: Hey, look. Pigeons! Phoenix: Yeah. And heaps of them, too. Maya: Did you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace? Phoenix: That's a dove, not a pigeon. Maya: ... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony? Phoenix: You're over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya. Magazine on orange-themed seat Maya: Ooh, there's a magazine here. Phoenix: It's a magazine full of job listings. Old Man: You disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away! Phoenix: \"Threw away\"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job? Old Man: Kah! That's none of your business! Phoenix: Sorry! I guess I'll take the magazine with me then. Old Man: I don't want anyone else having it! Give it back! Phoenix: (Too bad. Now that you want it so bad, I don't want to give it up!) Job Listings added to the Court Record. Old Man: Hey! That's mine! Closer orange-themed seat (after examining magazine on orange-themed seat) Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: You don't have to tell me twice. Talk What you saw Phoenix: Um... Excuse me. Old Man: ... Phoenix: Would you mind if I had a word with you? Old Man: Yes! Phoenix: I just want to ask you a couple of questions... Old Man: What's the matter with you!? Can't you see I'm busy? So you don't like my seeds, eh, pigeons!? Phoenix: (He's really chucking those seeds at them! That's got to hurt!) Old Man: Go on! Eat this! Phoenix: (*sigh*) Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Maya: Yes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Kah! It's a disgrace, I tell you. An utter disgrace! Maya: A disgrace? Old Man: An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: Revealing!? You mean her uniform? Old Man: The youth of today! They don't have any shame! No shame, I tell you! Not one ounce! Whatever happened to the old bushido values of Japan, like honor and modesty? Maya: What about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing. Old Man: You!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace! Maya: Talk about hitting a girl where it hurts... Trés Bien Phoenix: Do you go to Trés Bien a lot? Old Man: Hmph! That miserable excuse for a restaurant? That garbage they serve in there's not food. Where's the sushi? The tempura? The rice!? Phoenix: Trés Bien is a French restaurant, sir... Old Man: Where do you think we are, boy? In Paris!? I want real food, not those snooty snacks! And what about those shameless girls!? Phoenix: You mean the waitresses? Old Man: You can see all the way up to their... their... Yes! The waitresses! They're practically naked! It's a disgrace, isn't it? Well, isn't it!? Phoenix: Listen, it's not my restaurant. Old Man: Kah! It's a miserable excuse for a restaurant, that place! Miserable! Phoenix: (He certainly knows the place. He must be a regular! But if he hates it so much, why does he keep going?) Trés Bien regular (appears after \"Trés Bien\") Maya: Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir? Old Man: ... Maya: It's just, if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Maya: He must be hiding something, right? Phoenix: If he is, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock... Oh, wait... I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... Maya: Remember, Nick. That Magatama is only on loan. You better find it or else! Phoenix: (If Pearls ever gets wind of this, I'm going to be in a world of pain...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, excuse me, sir. Could I just ask you about this... Old Man: ... Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: Here you go, boy! How does some pigeon feed sound to you!? Phoenix: (This wasn't exactly what I was hoping to get out of this guy...) Detention Center Present Job Listings Maya: Um, Maggey... Byrde: Oh, are you looking for some part-time work, Maya? Why don't you take a job at the restaurant? I bet Mr. Armstrong would hire you. Maya: Really? Me? Byrde: It's pretty cool being a waitress, you know. And in the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets! Maya: What secrets...? Byrde: You can't make it obvious, but just spy on him for a bit. You'll see. It's interesting. Maya: Wow! I can't wait to get my apron on now! Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Oh, so you met the owner, Mr. Armstrong! Phoenix: He's, um... Oh, how can I put this... pretty unique, huh? Byrde: He has a really intense aura. As a chef and as a person. Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Trés Bien Examine Cash register (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's really tight behind the cash register counter. Can Mr. Armstrong even get in there? And if he got in... could he get out again? Trinkets (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: There's a bunch of little trinkets on a shelf by the door. I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Magazine rack (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Ugh. All the clothes in these are absolutely atrocious! ...Some of them have been circled in red. ... I really hope Mr. Armstrong is not thinking of buying those. Table (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong must be a pretty big neat-freak. He already has this table ready to go. Now if only the food in this place was edible... Windows (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It looks pretty cold out there on the streets. Peaceful, though. It's nice that people can take it easy after the holiday rush. Crime scene (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: This must be the table where the poisoning occurred. The stain tells the story well. The whole area is still cordoned off with police tape. I guess it must still be under investigation. Present Job Listings Armstrong: Mademoiselle! Maya: Y-Yes? Armstrong: Are you looking for la job? Maya: What!? N-No, no. I was just... Armstrong: Let me see. Your style is un peu différent, but you 'ave a good face. Maya: ...Different? Armstrong: Félicitations! You 'ave passed! I will 'ire you! Bien! Come wiz me. I will teach you everyz'ing I know! Maya: N-Nick! HEEEEEELP! Phoenix: (I don't know whether to laugh or feel bad for Maya... Maybe I should do both...?) Vitamin Square Examine Sandbox Phoenix: When I think back to when I was young... ...I wonder what I found so great about playing in a sandbox. Maybe I'll come back here in the middle of the night one of these days to relive it. ... On second thought, being arrested by Gumshoe would be too embarrassing to bear. Fruit attractions Phoenix: You don't see many parks like this anymore. What a great place for kids to play. But that old man's the only one here, chucking his seeds at the pigeons. Pigeons Phoenix: The pigeons are so busy pecking at the seeds, they don't notice anything else. Seeing those birds eat with such intense focus... ...reminds me of Maya when she's scarfing down a burger. Closer orange-themed seat Phoenix: This is where I found that job listings magazine before. A guy like me carrying around a magazine like that kind of gives the wrong impression. I guess I better give it back to that old man once this investigation's over. Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Yes, you do. You know, the waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Hmph! If you ask me It's a disgrace! Th-That's what it is! An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: So, you didn't like that kind of thing, then? Old Man: ... Wh-What are you trying to say about me, boy!? Explain yourself! Phoenix: Um, nothing! I'm not saying anything about you... Old Man: I know your kind! You young ones with your spiky hair and your fancy suits! That heads of yours is over-flowing with filthy ideas! Phoenix: (...I know someone who needs to learn some stress management.) Old Man: Get out of here, you young brat! Trés Bien regular Phoenix: So, you are a regular at that restaurant, right, sir? Old Man: ... Phoenix: You're always complaining about the place, so why do you go there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Phoenix: (Something's not right about this guy... But If he's hiding something, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock.) Oh, wait... (I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... I need to find it before I can get anywhere with this old man.) After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Looks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later. Examine Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. There's nothing for him to do right now, so he's catching some vertical z's. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Poor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Trés Bien once things have cooled off. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Well, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!? Phoenix: Um, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation. Gumshoe: Well, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's really fired up about this...) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor... Phoenix: (Oh. ... Him.) Gumshoe: Now, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again... Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Gumshoe: Um... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!? Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Hitting the gas is like hitting the fast-forward button on your life.\" No. That's too obscure. You don't really get the \"you'll die before your time\" idea. I need something more direct. Something a bit more light-hearted. Something like, \"Hitting the gas is your passport to paradise!\" Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT!? Poisoned coffee waitress gets a retrial!? I knew it! I knew there was something funny about the taste of this coffee! OK! Who brought me this coffee today? Hands up! Phoenix: (Yeesh! Have a little faith in your subordinates!) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Phoenix: No matter what, whenever I come here, that mascot's there to greet me. Chief: You got that right. That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Phoenix: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're married. Phoenix: (So should I expect to see Baby Badger next time I'm here...?) Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: So the guilty party was Maggey Byrde, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah... Phoenix: Back when she was on the police force... ...you were her mentor when she was a rookie, right? Gumshoe: Yeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened. Phoenix: (Gumshoe sure is sweating up a storm over nothing... ...Ah, so that's it! Our big ol' Gumshoe has a little ol' crush on Maggey!) Gumshoe: I... I don't like her or anything! I... I was... Aaaargh! Phoenix: (Note to self: Gossip with Maya about this later!) Gumshoe: Look, pal! Don't tell anyone, OK!? You've gotta keep it a secret, got it!? Phoenix: S-Sure... And would you mind not guessing what I'm thinking all the time? Gumshoe: Hey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind. The victim Phoenix: So I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim? Gumshoe: Glen Elg, he was a computer programmer. Phoenix: I see. A programmer... Gumshoe: He was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal. Phoenix: (Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often? Gumshoe: Not according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy. Phoenix: (A programmer... and a first-time customer at that...) (Changed from [A programmer... and a first-time customer...] in the original release) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that? Gumshoe: That's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial. Phoenix: You're kidding! What was her supposed \"motive\"? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK? Phoenix: (What could this motive have been...?) The investigation Gumshoe: This isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself. Phoenix: O-Oh, that's right... Gumshoe: The judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony. Phoenix: Yeah... Doesn't sound very good for us, huh? Gumshoe: Look, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop. Phoenix: (That's not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony? Contradictions (appears after \"The investigation\") Gumshoe: The biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table. Phoenix: Yeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim. Gumshoe: Right. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD... Phoenix: (CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...) Byrde: And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Gumshoe: But our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD. Phoenix: What? Gumshoe: Not on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal. Phoenix: But didn't Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too? Gumshoe: Yeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie. Phoenix: A radio? He didn't have a CD player? Gumshoe: You got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all. Phoenix: (Come to think of it... The owner of Trés Bien didn't mention that CD either. I don't know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong's got something to hide...) The charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile) Phoenix: So what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Trés Bien? Gumshoe: It's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected with the case anyway... Phoenix: Hey, come on, Detective. Didn't you say you'd give me the dirt on anything? Gumshoe: Well, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stuff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK? Phoenix: Um... Don't suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Trés Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.) Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? (I've got to track this creep down!) Magazine Clipping Gumshoe: I wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was. Phoenix: And what did he say? Gumshoe: He started off by saying, \"I'm at a complete loss for words...\" But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour. Phoenix: But... Gumshoe: He said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty! Phoenix: (It looked like I was \"trying to get Maggey found guilty\"...?) Sports Paper Gumshoe: What's that? A sports paper? Phoenix: Yeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Gumshoe: It's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here. Phoenix: And take a look at this. See this writing here? Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... Hey! Phoenix: What is it? Gumshoe: I've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Gumshoe: Hey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble. Phoenix: (Handwriting, huh? It'd be good to know more about that, in any case...) Gumshoe: Thanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue! Sports Paper given to Detective Gumshoe. Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: Hey! So how come she's not with you today? Phoenix: She's working down at the restaurant right now. Gumshoe: Working, huh? Yeah, it's tough being broke. I would know. Phoenix: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: Next time I see her, I'll show her how to make the world's best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It's the only way! Phoenix: (Um... Why is he shaking my hand with such enthusiasm...?) Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Phoenix: What? Mia did? Gumshoe: Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Godot profile Gumshoe: That's the guy who's gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey's retrial tomorrow. Phoenix: O-Oh, really? Gumshoe: He was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal. Phoenix: (Why's that guy so determined to see me fail?) Gumshoe: You sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind. Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything. Phoenix: It's OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right. Gumshoe: ... You know what? You're not such a bad guy after all, pal. Maggey Byrde profile Phoenix: Have you gone to see Maggey? Gumshoe: Of course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words. Phoenix: Oh... Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to. Phoenix: (Did he go for her, or for himself...?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: The chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Phoenix: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day. Phoenix: Under orders? Old Man: Yeah. You know, there's something about the lady... I mean, guy. Phoenix: Huh!? You can't stop thinking about him!? Gumshoe: Not like that, pal! Gimme a break! He's not my type. I mean, I can't stop thinking that he's involved with this case somehow! Phoenix: (Sounds like he knows a little something more about our charming chef.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you make of this...? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant... Phoenix: (You don't have to explain... Really...) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.: January 6Trés Bien Phoenix: The scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...) ???: Ah! Welcome! Bee avenue! Phoenix: (Wow. What a cute voice.) Maya: Oh, it's just you, Nick. Phoenix: M-Maya! Maya: Well? How do I look? Phoenix: ... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium... Maya: Maybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer. Phoenix: (Then who was that woman I just saw?) Maya: Oh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat! Phoenix: ... I am kind of hungry, actually. Talk Waitress Phoenix: So, how do you like your new job, Maya? Maya: I never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people's orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that. Phoenix: Yeah, it's a nice-looking restaurant. It's a shame more people don't come. Maya: Don't forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my \"gimme a tip\" smile! Lunch special Maya: Hey, Nick! Why don't you order something? The chef's preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says. Phoenix: How much is it? Maya: It's the Twin-T set. So it's 20 dollars, of course. Phoenix: The Twin-T set? I believe I'll be taking a pass. It's kind of expensive. Maya: What!? But you can't! Come on, Nick! It's not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register! Phoenix: How about cleaning the toilets? That should keep you busy. Maya: Yeah, right! Maybe later. Present Anything Phoenix: About this... Maya: Sorry, Nick! I'm a waitress now. I've got a pile of work waiting for little ol' me. After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um... About the lunch... Maya: Oh! A fine choice, sir. Phoenix: No. I, um... Maya: KITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT! Phoenix: I don't need any of that! Maya: Just a moment, please, sir. Phoenix: (Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya! Maya: Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set! Phoenix: Whoa! Maya: A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit! Phoenix: Um, thanks...? Maya: Come on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already! Phoenix: (Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp! Maya: Well? Phoenix: Are you hungry, Maya? Maya: I'm starving! Phoenix: Here. It's yours. Maya: Really!? ... Urp! Phoenix: Remember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate! Maya: ... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets! Phoenix: Hey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!) Trés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record. Phoenix: How does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad? Maya: Hey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen? Phoenix: (The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.) Talk Kitchen Phoenix: Hmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? \"In the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!\" Maya: In the kitchen? Mmm. That sounds tasty! Phoenix: Hey, wait up! Maya! Maya: What is it? I'm pretty busy right now. Phoenix: Weren't you going to show me around? Maya: Tsk. There goes my plan to find some cool clue and show it off in your face... Phoenix: (I'd better conduct the search in the kitchen myself!) After clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Trés Bien: January 6Trés BienKitchen Maya: And here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually. Phoenix: ... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure. Maya: Mr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop! Examine Mirror Maya: Now THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty. Phoenix: There's a book on the dresser. \"Claurice Armstrong's Bedtime Literature\". Maya: Not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it? Phoenix: It looks like a collection of poems he's written. Maya: Poems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK? Phoenix: OK, um... Here's one. Ahem! It's called, \"Printemps\". \"Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must.\" Maya: Huh? That's it!? Phoenix: Yup. That's a poem for you. Oil bottles Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: There's one bottle that's different from all the others. Phoenix: Well what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either. Maya: And... *sniff* It doesn't smell. Phoenix: (So what's that liquid inside then, I wonder?) Maya: Hey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he? Small Bottle added to the Court Record. Oil bottles (subsequent times) Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Lace curtains Phoenix: What are these lace curtains for? Maya: I don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those. Phoenix: (How do you respond to something like that!?) Table Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter! Maya: My Magatama! What's it doing there!?

Phoenix: I'd like to see how one of those slices through a cheesecake. Maya: A cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick. Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I just ate for lunch? Maya: Maybe...

Phoenix: What is it, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: The lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me. Phoenix: (He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything? Gumshoe: They said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it. Phoenix: (I expected as much...) Gumshoe: The victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment. Sports Paper refiled into the Court Record. Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal? Phoenix: (Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...) Talk Armstrong's secret (appears after presenting Small Bottle) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes... Gumshoe: So, how was it? Phoenix: To put it nicely... it was inedible. Gumshoe: Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so... Phoenix: Yeah... I guess it's probably the food. Gumshoe: The real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt. Phoenix: Really? How much does he owe? Gumshoe: This is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red. Phoenix: H-Half a million? Are we talking dollars? Gumshoe: Yeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble! Phoenix: Sorry. That figure just took me by surprise. Gumshoe: Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch.

Present Sports Paper Gumshoe: So according to the boys down at the lab, the doodles were probably made by the victim. Phoenix: Probably? Gumshoe: Analyzing this kind of writing is difficult since it's done with a fiber-tipped pen. But don't worry! I'll vouch for it. Phoenix: (Why would Gumshoe have to vouch for it? Can't it stand on its own?) Small Bottle Gumshoe: You got one of those aroma bottles too, huh? Phoenix: Only this one doesn't smell. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get you... Phoenix: This was mixed in with all the other aromatherapy bottles, but it's not the same. It doesn't even look the same, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: A cologne bottle that doesn't smell, huh? Smells like a skunk to me, pal! Mind letting me borrow that bottle for a while? I wanna send it to the lab for analysis. Phoenix: (The victim was poisoned, so the contents of this bottle are pretty important...) Small Bottle given to Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: I had a lunch there was something funny about that chef. Phoenix: You suspect Jean Armstrong? Gumshoe: I've got that guy's number. I know what his secret is. Phoenix: (That must be the same secret Gumshoe was talking about before.) Gumshoe: I guess I'd better fill you in on the details. About this Armstrong guy's secret, I mean... Jean's Loan Contract Gumshoe: It's for half a million dollars, pal! That's... um... half a million dollar bills! Phoenix: (What was the \"um\" in there for!?) Is there really that much money tied up in this case? Gumshoe: I can't give you an answer on that, pal. Not without the case file in front of me. But I'll tell you this... That Armstrong guy would've done anything for cash. He was desperate, you know? Phoenix: No, I don't.

Leads back to: \"So do you 'ave any proof?\" Phoenix: It seems old habits die hard, Mr. Armstrong. Armstrong: Wh-What is z'at? Phoenix: This is my Magatama. And I found it in your kitchen. Armstrong: Nooooon! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (Wow, that scream just about broke some windows...) Armstrong: Oui... oui... I-I 'ave a weakness for la little trinkets and la figurines. My 'and, it just slips out. I cannot stop it. Phoenix: You've stolen handkerchiefs, gloves, and other things from your customers, right? Armstrong: Oui! It is la truth! I am just a timid little girl inside, monsieur. A timid little girl! Besides, z'is time, it was not la small trinket, oui? It was 500,000 dollars! Mais, non! Why would I steal it? I 'ave no need for such money. Phoenix: Really now? Armstrong: Oh, monsieur. What is it? Phoenix: Isn't it true that you're in some pretty serious trouble? And that you are in desperate need of a large amount of cash? Present Jean's Loan Contract Phoenix: Leads to: \"This restaurant is deep in the red, isn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Mr. Armstrong!? Armstrong: Mais, monsieur. It is not I who is in trouble. Is it you, non? Phoenix: Huh? Armstrong: Une petite question... Phoenix: Wh-What? Armstrong: It means, \"a little question\". Together now, w'iz me! Une petite question. Phoenix: Oon put it keschon. Armstrong: Bravo, monsieur! Oh, you are a dream! Excellent! Phoenix: (We're definitely not on the same page here... let alone book...) Armstrong: Is z'at all...? Leads back to: \"Besides, z'is time, it was not la small trinket, oui? It was 500,000 dollars!\" Phoenix: This restaurant is deep in the red, isn't it? Armstrong: Ah! Phoenix: You have a loan... to the tune of half a million dollars! That lottery ticket would have wiped out your debts. Armstrong: Gnnngh... Phoenix: Well, Mr. Armstrong!?

Maya: But you just told us you did! You said you took a ticket! Armstrong: Mais non, ma fille! It was not... ???: That's enough. Maya: Huh? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr. Godot! Phoenix: What in the heck are you doing here!? Godot: Urgh! This is without doubt... the worst coffee I have ever tasted, Mr. Armstrong. Phoenix: (He came in here for coffee!? Does his craving for coffee know no bounds!?) Godot: Perhaps Mr. Armstrong stole one of the victim's tickets on the day in question. Armstrong: I am la air'ead, non? Just a pretty little girl who everyone is laughing at. Maya: But, in that case, Maggey shouldn't be the only one under suspicion... Godot: He had the wrong ticket. Phoenix: ...What? Godot: Mr. Armstrong made off with the winning ticket's pretty neighbor. Maya: So... the ticket he took was worthless? Godot: Not quite. He did win something. A dollar. Armstrong: You see! I am just a pretty face! W'izout my looks, I 'ave nothing! Phoenix: So... What happened to the winning ticket, then? The one he meant to steal. Godot: Indeed. What did happen to it? I don't like spoiling myself by watching trailers, so... ...we'll just wait and see how the movie turns out tomorrow, won't we? Maya: Nngh... Armstrong: Voilà! You two! Time to laugh at la pretty little air'ead! Phoenix: (Looks like I won't be needing this note anymore.) Victor's Note thrown into the trash. Phoenix: Looks like we've got a new mystery now. Namely, where did the winning ticket go? Maya: I've got a bad feeling about this. Phoenix: Well, anyway. We can't let Maggey suffer any longer for this. And certainly not again. To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)

I guess I should've expected this. Nobody saw the other guy, huh? But he was there when I took the coffee over, sir. Scout's honor! ???: Maggey! Byrde: Ack! D-Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: A-Are you doing alright!? How're you feeling!? Byrde: ...As if you need to ask either question, sir. Gumshoe: Don't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK? Byrde: Roger! Gumshoe: And you! Phoenix: Y-Yes? Gumshoe: You'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest! Phoenix: (I-I think he's serious!) Maya: Hey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right? Gumshoe: Yup. Maya: So you'll be able to help Maggey out, right? Byrde: Really? Can you, sir!? Gumshoe: O... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright? Phoenix: S-Sure. Gumshoe: OK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!? Byrde: I can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you. Maya: Looks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh? Phoenix: (I can only wish...) January 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Godot: ... Aaah, bitter! Judge: Mr... Um... Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor? Judge: Aaaah! Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong!? Judge: Nothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating. Phoenix: No, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix. Judge: I see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he? Phoenix: (\"Our trusty\"...?) Judge: So, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please. Godot: Mr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today. Phoenix: But I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright! Godot: I wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out. Phoenix: (There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!) Judge: As everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial. Phoenix: (I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!) Judge: Now then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness. Godot: Let's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation? Gumshoe: ... Judge: Witness! State your name for the court! Gumshoe: Huh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe. Godot: Other way around, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir! Judge: Since yesterday? Gumshoe: Yeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now. Maya: I hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake. Judge: I see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case? Gumshoe: Y-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report. Judge: The court accepts this into evidence. Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Um... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress. Judge: The waitress being the accused? Gumshoe: Yeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo. Judge: Hmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me. Trés Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record. Godot: Come, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands. Judge: Now then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony. Gumshoe: Umm... Yes, sir... Witness Testimony -- The Incident -- Gumshoe: When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir. We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time. Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup. And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch! And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive. Judge: Hmm... Godot: Using the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady! Judge: The facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but... Phoenix: Yes? Judge: Please, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood? Phoenix: I already told you! That wasn't me! Cross Examination -- The Incident -- Gumshoe: When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Can I stop you for just a minute? Gumshoe: Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence? Phoenix: (He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's what she said. And I-- Godot: Godot: What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction? Phoenix: Hey! Godot: Sadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Well, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way. Godot: Ha...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Trés Bien, Trite! Phoenix: ...! Godot: I have here in my possession a ticket. Phoenix: A ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.) Godot: Yes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen. Judge: This is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct? Godot: I think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table? Phoenix: Urk! Judge: It certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Can I stop you for just a minute? Gumshoe: Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence? Phoenix: (He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's what she said. And I-- Godot: Godot: What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction? Phoenix: Hey! Godot: Sadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table. Judge: Hmm... Gumshoe: We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He was listening to his radio, you say? Gumshoe: Yeah. He had a portable radio in his chest pocket. Maya: Maggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\". Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: And what was it that the victim was listening to on the radio, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Huh? How should I know? Phoenix: (Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.) Maya: This isn't going very well, is it...? Judge: Hmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used? Leads back to cross-examination Gumshoe: Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else? Gumshoe: Not sure I get you, pal. Phoenix: Was the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder? Gumshoe: If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance. Phoenix: So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper... Godot: Godot: Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite? Gumshoe: The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: It seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee? Gumshoe: Huh!? What do you mean? Phoenix: According to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!? Gumshoe: Oh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think-- Godot: Godot: In case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there. Gumshoe: Huh? For me? Godot: \"Oh, hey! You're right!\"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence. Gumshoe: Th... THAT piece... sir? Godot: Yes. THAT piece. Gumshoe: ... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again? Godot: This! Phoenix: (Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?) Gumshoe: Oh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup. Godot: Yes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim. Judge: Oh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it. Godot: Conclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this! Phoenix: Uuuurgh! Gumshoe: For the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's. Coffee Cup added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Upon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance... Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else? Gumshoe: Not sure I get you, pal. Phoenix: Was the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder? Gumshoe: If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance. Phoenix: So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper... Godot: Godot: Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite? Gumshoe: The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: It seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee. Gumshoe: And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: (Potassium cyanide? I've heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: It's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history. Maya: How much is too much? Godot: A lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off. Maya: 0.2 grams? How much is that? Gumshoe: You know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much. Phoenix: (Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...) Judge: Hmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere. Gumshoe: And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Some kind of a motive\"? Gumshoe: Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion. Godot: Godot: You know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get it. Godot: I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out. Gumshoe: *gulp* Godot: So stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive? Phoenix: (Come on, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: She was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket. Phoenix: I knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.) Gumshoe: It disappeared from the scene of the crime. Godot: And it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million! Maya: Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one... Phoenix: (Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Wait a minute! The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client! Godot: Ha...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question! Judge: Th-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...? Gumshoe: One of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant. Phoenix: WH-WHAAAAAT!? Judge: Order! Order! Godot: Ha...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress. Judge: Y-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately! Phoenix: (Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...) Victim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record. Judge: The ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...? Godot: It's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor. Phoenix: (And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey's person...] in the original release) Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Victim's Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Some kind of a motive\"? Gumshoe: Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion. Godot: Godot: You know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get it. Godot: I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out. Gumshoe: *gulp* Godot: So stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive? Phoenix: (Come on, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: She was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket. Phoenix: I knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.) Gumshoe: It disappeared from the scene of the crime. Godot: And it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million! Maya: Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one... Phoenix: (Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?) Maya: You really think there are any contradictions in this testimony? Phoenix: To be honest, I don't know. Maya: But Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line? Phoenix: (I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.) After selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements: Judge: That's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime. Godot: I like an old man who knows the score. Judge: There is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules! Godot: I don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money. Maya: Not good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast. Phoenix: Yeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already. Godot: I'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence. Phoenix: (He's got more evidence against Maggey!?) Godot: This is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time. Maya: Wow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen... Phoenix: Th-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?) Godot: Ha...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself. Phoenix: The coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye... Godot: Of course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more. Judge: Something else? I presume you mean... Godot: Of course. I'm referring to the pocket. Phoenix: The... pocket? Godot: A search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket! Phoenix: A bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket? Gumshoe: Yeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it. Phoenix: WHAAAT!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence. Apron added to the Court Record. Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record. Judge: There's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court? Godot: Bloodstain? What bloodstain would that be? Judge: Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron! Godot: That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain! Phoenix: (You don't need to be told! Just look at it!) Godot: Well, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!? Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir. Phoenix: Ketchup!? Gumshoe: She must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day. Judge: ... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe! Godot: Pull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness! Gumshoe: Unnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already. Judge: Hmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case. Phoenix: ...! Judge: The motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established. Godot: Well, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all. Phoenix: (Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!) Judge: Witness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there. Witness Testimony -- The Investigation -- Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir. Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her. The victim didn't have any identification on him. But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly. When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison. And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene. Judge: Hmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good. Godot: Last chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite! Phoenix: ...! Godot: Don't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin! Cross Examination -- The Investigation -- Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Scary old man\", Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: There's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened. Phoenix: (Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...) Gumshoe: Officers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. \"What took you so long!?\" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds... Judge: Hmm... Seeds... Godot: Ha...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth. Phoenix: (I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...) Godot: The old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime. Gumshoe: Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How long was the defendant unconscious for? Gumshoe: The officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself. Phoenix: (I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...) Gumshoe: I woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful. Phoenix: (You're a professional detective, Gumshoe. Not a professional bird watcher!) Godot: Save the romantics for your own time, Detective. All we need to know about is the investigation. Gumshoe: Oops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I? Gumshoe: The victim didn't have any identification on him. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then? Gumshoe: No, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet. Phoenix: Fifty-eight cents...? Gumshoe: Yeah. I can't believe I found someone with less in their wallet than me, pal! Judge: The victim sounds like he was a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... Why not give him a bit of an edge? Phoenix: (I think I'm on to something here...) Gumshoe: But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...) Gumshoe: There was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket. Godot: It seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Trés Bien. Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?) Leave it Phoenix: (I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the prescription bag Phoenix: So what sort of medicine was in the bag? Gumshoe: Well... Actually, the bag we found was empty. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Yeah. Completely empty. Phoenix: (It was completely empty...?) Victim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record. Godot: Ha...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence? Desperate, are you, Trite? Phoenix: ...! Godot: Now, what happened with the investigation after that, Detective? Leads back to cross-examination Ask about his health insurance Phoenix: So, the victim had no form of identification on him, correct? Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: And yet, before arriving at the restaurant, he went to see a doctor. Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him! Judge: Oh! That is very true! Phoenix: The fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen! Godot: Ha...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with! Phoenix: Huh? Judge: Hmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... A bit of an edge never hurt anyone. Maya: Looks like we're off course again, Nick. Judge: Witness. Please continue with your testimony. Explain for the court the events following the preliminary investigation. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Victim's Prescription Bag is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...) Gumshoe: There was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket. Godot: It seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Trés Bien. Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court. Gumshoe: When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But the defendant had been passed out for a while, correct? In that case... Isn't it possible someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket!? Gumshoe: Hey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal! Judge: Hmm... Gumshoe: It happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes! Godot: Godot: Keep up this crazy testimony, Detective, and those shoes will end up down your throat! Gumshoe: Sorry... Godot: So, Trite. \"Someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket\"...? That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence? Phoenix: Um... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...) Judge: It appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness. Gumshoe: And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for. Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: Interesting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh? Phoenix: (And they're just going to let him get away with it...?) Judge: It was just one dollar, Detective. Maya: I guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe. Present Victim's Prescription Bag Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you.\" Phoenix: If I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict! Maya: Gumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something! Phoenix: Yeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious. Maya: Come on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony. Gumshoe: Oho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you? Phoenix: You testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later? Gumshoe: Um, no. They didn't. Phoenix: The victim was given a prescription right before going to Trés Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!? Gumshoe: Y-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!! Judge: I-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!? Gumshoe: I, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh? Phoenix: The victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself! Judge: O-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that? Godot: Ha...! That's all. Phoenix: What!? Godot: Read for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will. Phoenix: What's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological? Judge: Just what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot? Godot: Hardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say. Judge: A war wound? Godot: The day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum. Phoenix: He ruptured his eardrum!? Judge: Then what on earth was the prescription he was given? Godot: It was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested! Phoenix: What!? Godot: It's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear. Judge: Yes. Here it is. In very, very fine print. Godot: It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication. Phoenix: Uuurgh... Judge: It seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all. Phoenix: N-No... Maya: Nick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over! Phoenix: (She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?) Push the medication issue Leads to: \"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\" Leave it Phoenix: It does seem as it the medication isn't connected to the case. Godot: Ha...! Maybe the last Mr. Trite was the real one. At least he didn't waste time. Judge: Indeed... If you have nothing further to add to this medication issue... ...the facts of this case seem no different to those presented on the last trial. I would therefore have no choice but to hand down my verdict. Phoenix: Uh... Umm...! Maya: Nick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground! Judge: Now then... Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Your Honor! Actually, this prescription... is absolutely pivotal to the case! Judge: Mr. Wright! Did you not just say the exact opposite only moments ago!? Phoenix: (Gotta lose a few battles in order to win the war, I suppose.) Leads to: \"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\" Phoenix: Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!? Godot: ...! Judge: But the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal! Phoenix: Phoenix: That doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth! Godot: Godot: You know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide. Phoenix: Phoenix: It hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable! Godot: Aaargh! Judge: That's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call? Godot: ... Judge: Mr. Godot...? Godot: ... Gumshoe: Um... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder. Phoenix: (Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?) Judge: Very well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me. Maya: Yay! Good job, Nick! Judge: The court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness. Godot: Ha...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups. Judge: Court is adjourned for recess! January 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Maya: Phew! That was close! Phoenix: Tell me about it... I nearly died in there! Byrde: That's my line, sir! Maya: No! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit. Byrde: Looks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!? Maya: Huh? Byrde: He said he'd help me. But he totally set me up! Phoenix: I don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right? Byrde: It's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again! Phoenix: (Poor Gumshoe...) Maya: So the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right? Phoenix: Yeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds! Byrde: I bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know? Maya: Yeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds! January 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: Court will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please. Godot: The prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand. Godot: Name and occupation, if you don't mind. Kudo: The name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too. Phoenix: We don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation. Kudo: My occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!? Phoenix: Kimono embroidery? Kudo: That's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed! Maya: Wow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime. Kudo: Anyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile! Phoenix: (That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...) Judge: Now then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident? Kudo: Oh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino. Judge: Seeds? Kudo: What do you think these are, hmm!? Judge: I-I see... Godot: So you saw everything that happened, gramps? Kudo: Did I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all! Godot: Then please, tell the court. We're all ears. Kudo: Sure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail! Phoenix: (He's really getting into this...) Witness Testimony -- What I Witnessed -- Kudo: The young man was reading the sports paper. The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed. That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well! Judge: Mr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress. Kudo: Kah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!? Judge: N-Newfangled? Kudo: All this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you! Judge: E-Excuse me... Kudo: Listen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away! Judge: Well, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Cross Examination -- What I Witnessed -- Kudo: The young man was reading the sports paper. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you saw the victim, then? You saw Mr. Glen Elg? Kudo: I wanted to know if Gusten Brawn retained his championship or not. Phoenix: (So he was looking at the sports paper the victim was reading, huh...) And at the location in question... ...there are partitions between tables on the same side of the restaurant, right? Kudo: So what if there are? Phoenix: If you say that you could see the victim... ...that means you were sitting at a table on the other side of the restaurant, correct? Kudo: Kah! I go to that place to drink javaccino! I don't go to sit! I don't remember what table I was sitting at! Phoenix: (You mean you go there to eye the waitress!) Kudo: The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw? Kudo: Victor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i! Phoenix: I see... Kudo: My eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving. Phoenix: (...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.) Kudo: And I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well! Phoenix: (I bet I know what's coming up and something tells me I'm not going to like it...) Leave it Phoenix: (It'd be dangerous to press this too much. I'd better ignore it for now.) So, what happened next? Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Your Honor. We need more clarification on what was put into the victim's coffee. I'd like to ask that the witness add what he knows about this to his testimony. Judge: Hmm... I agree. Witness, will you enlighten us, please? Kudo: Sure, sure. Adds statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\" Press (after adding statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw? Kudo: Victor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i! Phoenix: I see... Kudo: My eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving. Phoenix: (...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.) Kudo: And I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well! Kudo: There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: D-Did she really put that into the coffee? Kudo: You doubt me, boy!? She too some out of a small, brown bottle and sprinkled it in. Phoenix: Couldn't she have been adding sugar? Kudo: Sugar!? In a small, brown bottle like that!? Judge: \"Like that\"? Witness, could you please describe the bottle in more concrete terms? Godot: Ha...! A bottle like this, perhaps? Kudo: Oh, there it is! That's the one! Judge: That's the bottle of potassium cyanide, I presume? Godot: So what did the accused put into the coffee? I think it's clear, don't you? Phoenix: Argh... Kudo: The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He took just one sip? Kudo: You young'uns! You waste everything! Those javaccinos cost 8 dollars! In the good old days, we would have drank every last drop, eaten the cup, and then died! Phoenix: (Congratulations. You have earned the title of Battiest Man To Grace A Courtroom.) Godot: So it was an immediate death? Well, with potassium cyanide, I suppose that is possible. Kudo: Oh, yes. He slumped over without so much as a twitch! I felt the javaccino I'd just drank turn sour in my stomach. Godot: Oh, yes. I know that feeling. Judge: And the waitress? I presume she is...? Kudo: That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by? Kudo: Particular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is! Phoenix: Sorry? Kudo: You can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform! Phoenix: Phoenix: So the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me! Judge: Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image. Maya: Don't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together! Phoenix: (I-I guess I got a bit carried away...) Kudo: Kah! There are other things I recognize about her, too. Phoenix: (He seems pretty sure of himself. What should I do?) Leave it Phoenix: (There's got to be a better line of attack than this. That's what I should be looking for now...) Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Sure, you saw a waitress take the coffee over to the victim. But what matters is whether that waitress was Maggey Byrde or not. Judge: Quite right. Mr. Kudo. These other \"features\" that you recognize about the defendant... I would ask you to add them to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Adds statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\" Press (after adding statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by? Kudo: Particular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is! Phoenix: Sorry? Kudo: You can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform! Phoenix: Phoenix: So the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me! Judge: Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image. Maya: Don't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together! Phoenix: (I-I guess I got a bit carried away...) Kudo: Kah! There are other things I recognize about her, too. Kudo: There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (There's no doubt he remembers the waitress pretty well. What should I do? I get the feeling there's something more to this somehow...) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I must be imagining it. I need to find another angle with this guy.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the straps Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. You seem especially interested in straps. Why is that? Kudo: Wh-What? Phoenix: The ribbon in her hair, the straps on her apron. What's the fascination? Kudo: F-Fascination? Godot: Godot: People have all kinds of fetishes, Trite. We don't need to embarrass the witness. Kudo: Listen, you young upstarts! I haven't got some sick strap fetish! Judge: Hmm... Is there any relevance to the witness's unusual love of straps, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I was just curious as to why he was so fixated on the waitress's straps... Kudo: I said I haven't got a strap fetish! How many times do I have to repeat myself!? Judge: Very well. Continue with your testimony, Mr. Kudo. And make it strapless. Kudo: *grumble grumble* Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the waitress's back Phoenix: The identifying \"features\" you described are all things you would see from the back. Kudo: So what? Phoenix: Is it possible that... ...you never saw the waitress from the front at all!? Godot: Godot: Ha...! He's got you there, gramps! Phoenix: People normally talk about facial features when they're asked to describe someone. But this witness's testimony is nothing but straps and ribbons! Kudo: Th-This is harassment! I tell you I'm not obsessed with straps or ribbons! I'm just telling you what I saw! Judge: Mr. Kudo, the court requests that you add details about any identifying features... Features you observed from the front, that is, to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Maya: The old man's testimony is getting longer and longer! Phoenix: And if I can't find a hole in it soon, it'll get even longer, I bet. Adds statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\" Press (after adding statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm... Kudo: There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't find anything to be distinct, but you did clearly see the witness's face, yes? Kudo: No question about it! I didn't come this far to back down now! Victor Kudo never backs down! Phoenix: (That's not the answer I was looking for, but OK...) Maya: This has turned into a matter of pride for Old Seedy now, I guess... I wonder if he really did see Maggey's face or not... Phoenix: (Like I thought, we need some concrete proof of this. Proof that the old guy didn't see the waitress clearly from the front.) Present Apron Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\" Maya: Do you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it? Phoenix: Well, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there. Maya: But he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress... Phoenix: I-I guess... (Hmm, she makes a good point though...) Maya: Hey! Did I just say something clever? Phoenix: I wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw really was Maggey... Maya: That's what we have to figure out, Nick! Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this. Kudo: Kah! That filthy thing would suit filth like you just perfectly. Actually, it reminds me of what my grandson looks like, just after he's done eating. Phoenix: Have you ever seen this before? Kudo: Of course I haven't! Do you think I'd forget something as dirty as that!? Hmm? Well? You half-witted clot!? Phoenix: ... Judge: ... ......... Kudo: Wh-What!? What is it!? Ever since I said, \"you half-witted clot\", there's been an eerie silence in here. Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. This apron... ...is the apron worn by the defendant on the day of the poisoning! Kudo: Uh? Phoenix: And as you just said yourself... ...you wouldn't forget something like this. Which means, is you had really seen this apron before... Kudo: Er... Phoenix: Yes, you know what I'm getting at! You couldn't have possibly seen the waitress from the front! Kudo: ... Oops! Judge: Witness! You can't just \"oops\" your way out of this! Godot: Ha...! Well, well... Looks like we finally have a genuine trial on our hands. Phoenix: ... Godot: Listen, Trite. Here are the facts. On the day of the incident, there was only one waitress in the restaurant. Judge: That being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde? Godot: Exactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching! Judge: Hmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing. Godot: Just tell the court exactly what you saw, gramps. Kudo: You can rely on me, Captain! My noggin's in perfect working order. I can't remember a single occasion when I forgot what burger a customer wanted! Maya: He can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out... Judge: Very well. Let's test just how good your memory and attention to detail is, Mr. Kudo. Tell us what you remember about the victim. Witness Testimony -- About the Victim -- Kudo: He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles. He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages! The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well. Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino. The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip. Judge: The testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail. Kudo: Oh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything! Maya: How are we going to handle this, Nick? Phoenix: We only need to do one thing. We just need to prove that the old man's memory is shot. Maya: Just trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel? Phoenix: (I suppose... But it's what I do best.) Cross Examination -- About the Victim -- Kudo: He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Spectacles? Kudo: Dark glasses to you! One of the lenses was green, but the other was broken. Newfangled rubbish! That's why I remember him so well. Phoenix: (He did have some kind of lens over his left eye... But I wouldn't have called it a pair of glasses.) Judge: Hmm... He seems to have been wearing some rather modern-looking shades. Perhaps I should take to wearing some, and rival Mr. Godot's sharp appearance. Maya: Ah! We better come up with something sharp, and quick! Phoenix: (Guess I'll wait and see if I should challenge him about the \"spectacles\"...) Kudo: He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The newspaper was a sports paper, was it? Kudo: That young hooligan! I nearly asked him, \"Can't you even read without fidgeting, hmm!?\" How was I supposed to be able to read the back page with all that rustling going on!? I needed to find out if Gusten Brawn retained his championship title! Phoenix: (It was his paper, not yours! If you wanted to know so bad, why didn't you buy your own!?) Kudo: What are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? How dare you judge me! Phoenix: Ow! Ooow! Maya: Gusten Brawn got beaten yesterday, by the way. Anyway... Kudo: The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The wireless? Kudo: The decadent young rascal! In my day, it was one or the other! Read the paper, or listen to the wireless! Phoenix: (...Oh boy.) Kudo: And using an earpiece! It's selfish, that's what it is! I was straining my ears, but I couldn't catch any of it. Phoenix: (Was he that desperate to listen to the radio...?) Kudo: What are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? 2 you feel sorry for me! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Kudo: Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean the waitress, who you only saw from behind, right? Kudo: You're one of those, are you? You never let anything go, isn't that right? Phoenix: ...Maybe. Kudo: What does it matter if I saw her from the front or from behind!? My eyes don't lie! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! (I better not push it until I've got some hard evidence.) Kudo: The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"His free hand\"? Kudo: Yes. Phoenix: Which hand was that? Kudo: Weren't you listening before, cloth-ears!? I said he was rustling the newspaper with his right hand, didn't I? If his free hand wasn't his right hand, then which hand was it, you moron! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Godot: Ha...! Perhaps the great Mr. Trite has three hands! Phoenix: (Yeesh! I was only asking! No need to gang up on me and treat me like a freak!) Present Coffee Cup Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony?\" Phoenix: (The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.) Maya: I guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh? Phoenix: (Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!) Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony? That this was a way of testing the credibility of your memory? Kudo: I know, I know! There's nothing wrong with my memory, I tell you! Nothing! If I got anything wrong, I'll eat these seeds and sing the pigeon song! Godot: Care to tell us where this is going, Trite? Phoenix: According to Mr. Kudo, the victim was holding the paper in his right hand... ...while drinking coffee with his free hand, which would make that his left. Kudo: Kah! What is this? Kindergarten? Phoenix: But I would like the court to please take a look at this. Judge: That's the cup victim used, correct? Phoenix: Yes, and on the rim, you'll notice the mark left by the victim's lips. Judge: Yes. There is a stain left by the coffee. Phoenix: If you consider where that stain is, you'll clearly see... ...that the victim was holding the cup in his right hand! Kudo: But how...? Phoenix: Well, Mr. Kudo. The court is waiting for your epic performance! You said you'd eat those seeds and sing the pigeon song! Kudo: Aaaargh! Judge: Mr. Kudo... I'm afraid this is simply not acceptable. I think the witness had better go back to the park where he came from. Kudo: WAAAAIT! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to you tell me I'm mad, you're wrong! I don't care about that dirty coffee cup! I know what I saw! Judge: Y-You still insist on your testimony? Kudo: That young brat was holding the cup in his left hand! Oh, yes. No question! I'm a good, law-abiding citizen, I am. It's that dead young hotbot and you, you spikey-haired yahoo, who are at fault! Phoenix: (Who, me!?) Judge: Th-Thank you, old man. We've heard quite enough from you already. Kudo: Don't call me \"old man\", old man! Been around for 68 years, I have. You can't ignore me! LISTEN TO WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAAAAY! Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but... Godot: Sure, why not hear a little more? Judge: M-Mr. Godot! Godot: But this is my 16th cup of coffee... So this is your final stand. Kudo: Thank you, Captain! You can rely on Victor! Witness Testimony -- Left Hand or Right Hand -- Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs. He kept fiddling with it all the time. He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too. And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand! Judge: We know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye. Godot: It wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers. Judge: A monitor? You mean, like a television screen!? Godot: The inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work. Kudo: HDTV, DVD, CD... All these newfangled letters drive me mad! But they don't matter. I know what I saw, and I'm telling the truth! Phoenix: (It's true... He doesn't seem to be lying.) Kudo: And those are the facts, in good old black and white! Cross Examination -- Left Hand or Right Hand -- Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the victim was wearing an HMD. Kudo: HDTV, CD, DVD... What does it matter!? Phoenix: (It was none of them actually, but anyway...) And you're sure that he was wearing the earpiece on the same side? Kudo: No question! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting. Phoenix: (Yeah. That's pretty obvious if you look at the floor plans. From the opposite table, he'd only have a view of the side of the victim's head.) Present Victim's Prescription Bag or Glen Elg profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but...\" Kudo: He kept fiddling with it all the time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: It seems you kept an eye on Mr. Glen Elg. Kudo: He was getting on my nerves! Rustling that newspaper and fiddling with his earpiece all the time! And then he went and made all that fuss dying from one sip of javaccino! I wanted to say to him, \"Calm down, you young brat!\" Just looking at him made me suddenly speed up my seed eating! I could've chocked! Phoenix: (So I take it the victim was a walking ball of nervous energy...) Kudo: He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The earpiece you mentioned... Which hand did the victim touch it with? Kudo: ... You're one of those people! One of those people who uses his left hand to get things out of his right pocket. Or fastens his left cuff with his right hand? And when the tour guide says, \"On your right side, you'll see the famous blah-blah\"... ...you're the only one who deliberately looks left! Well? Aren't you? Phoenix: N-No! I didn't mean... Kudo: Obviously he used the hand on the same side of his body that the earpiece was in! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Ow! (So, if he had the HMD on his left side, then it was his left hand, I guess...) Kudo: And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You seem very sure of yourself, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: That's because I know what I saw, no matter what tricks you try to play on me! Phoenix: (It looks like he really did see the guy picking the cup up with his left hand. This is a dead end!) Maya: Well, Nick? What do you think? Phoenix: I think the guy's telling the truth. But even so... Something's not quite right. Maya: Then chuck evidence at him until he breaks! Phoenix: (But if he's not lying, there wouldn't be any contradictions in his testimony, right?) Phoenix: I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but... Mr. Kudo! There is something very strange about your observations of the victim. Kudo: What!? Phoenix: You say he was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the HMD. Kudo: No question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting. Phoenix: I don't think so. Kudo: Wh-What did you say!? Phoenix: You're no doubt unaware of this fact, Mr. Kudo. But the victim couldn't hear with his left ear! His eardrum was ruptured! Kudo: Eh? Phoenix: Traces of medication for his condition were found in his ear canal. That's right! It's impossible that the victim was wearing his earpiece in his left ear. Because he couldn't even hear in that ear! Kudo: ... Is that true, Captain? Godot: ...It is. Kudo: ...Pi... Pi-Pi-Pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Pretty pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Judge: Order! Order! Order! Phoenix: This witness's testimony is completely unreliable! He only saw the witness from behind. And he claims the victim was wearing an earpiece when we know his eardrum was ruptured! Well, Mr. Godot!? Godot: Aaaargh! A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup! The old man... ...is my drop of milk! Kudo: Captain! Are you calling me a drip!? Judge: This is the victim's coffee cup in which the potassium cyanide was found. The mark on the rim clearly shows that the victim picked it up with his right hand! Kudo: I'll never back down! I know I'm right! The lad drank his javaccino with his left hand! Godot: Let me put you out of your misery... Clearly, the victim used both hands. He took a sip with the cup held in his right hand, and then switched to his left... That's what the old man saw! Phoenix: Phoenix: Impossible! The witness has already testified on numerous occasions... ...that the victim died immediately after taking just one sip of the coffee. Godot: Godot: Which hand the victim used to pick up his cup is irrelevant, Your Honor. The facts still stand! With one hand or the other, Mr. Elg drank the poisoned coffee... ...Like this! Phoenix: Phoenix: Sadly, Mr. Godot, that doesn't wash! The point of this testimony was to establish whether the witness's memory was credible. And the results are clear! The testimony given by this witness is useless! Godot: Puuuurgh! Judge: I believe it is time to conclude today's proceedings. I am satisfied that the witness is not deceiving the court. But to be frank, his testimony is a farce! Kudo: D-Did you have to be so frank!? Take that, you pompous old fogey! Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo. You can't reach me from there. I'm ordering the defense and the prosecution to investigate this case further. That is all for now. This court is adjourned! ???: Kudo: WAAAAIT! If we stop now, where does that leave me? Judge: Leave you, Mr. Kudo? Kudo: Thanks to that blue-suited young upstart over there... ...I'm just a bumbling old man who can't even dot his t's or cross his i's now! Phoenix: (How is your bad memory my fault!?) Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but there's nothing I can do. Kudo: I've kept my mouth shut until now... ...but there's something else the court should know! Godot: What!? Phoenix: There's more? Kudo: To be perfectly honest, it might not be anything. But I want another chance! I want another crack at you, you young shark! Phoenix: M-Me? (He's looking at me like I'm some sort of evil Shogun...) Kudo: Well, everyone? What do you say to one final showdown? The final chapter in this eccentric old man's scrapbook! Godot: Sorry, gramps... I've already had my 17th cup of coffee. Kudo: What have you got to lose, Captain? I'll give you all the javaccino you want if you come to my house after the trial. (Changed from [I'll give you all the coffee you want if you come to my house after the trial.] in the original release) I may be 68 years old, but Victor Kudo is still a man! Judge: That's enough, witness. I believe it will be quicker for the court to just hear your testimony. Kudo: You bet! Much, much quicker! Maya: I can't believe this is happening... Kudo: Ha ha ha! You better get ready, youngster! Phoenix: I get the picture! Just quit throwing those seeds at me, would you!? (He's gotta be using some sort of infinite ammo code with that box of seeds...) Witness Testimony -- The Final Showdown -- Kudo: First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself. The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino... Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over. It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked! Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm? Judge: ... Um... Is that all? Kudo: Yes, that's all. I remember it perfectly. Eh!? You're doubting me again? You're doubting a poor, defenseless old man!? Judge: N-No. We are not doubting you, Mr. Kudo. Maya: Don't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick? Phoenix: Yeah. \"So what?\" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy! Kudo: You're a birdbrain, that's why that's all you can think of! Judge: Very well... Mr. Wright. Your final cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- The Final Showdown -- Kudo: First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Um... The court generally prefers if witnesses are sure of themselves, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Noisy brat! I'm warning you, I'm more savage than a macho man right now! You won't beat me with this testimony! This is the final battle! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! (He's chucking those seeds harder than ever! I better be careful...) Maya: Come on, Nick! Nail him! Kudo: The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The court has already heard that testimony, Mr. Kudo... Kudo: I know that! I was just setting the mood. How else am I supposed to build up the suspense, hmm!? Phoenix: The suspense? Kudo: Isn't it enough? Should I work the audience a bit more? Judge: No, no! Please continue, Mr. Kudo. As quickly as possible! Kudo: Alright. Now where was I...? ...Ah yes. The young boy slumped over the table, and... Kudo: Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A vase, you say? Kudo: Yes. There are vases on all the tables in that place. They're accidents waiting to happen! They're practically begging to be knocked over! Phoenix: (Well, he's right about there being vases. I do remember seeing them, too... There was a vase on the table when I ate munch there.) And you saw the moment when the victim actually knocked over the vase? Kudo: Well... it's hard to say... It's a bit unclear... How do you really define... Phoenix: OK, I get it. Kudo: I heard it break! And the sight of it is burned into my memory as clear as day! Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\" Kudo: It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Soaked in water, you mean? Kudo: Yes. It splashed me on the knee as well. Phoenix: You said you were sitting at a table across the room from the victim, correct? And yet, the water still managed to splash onto you? Kudo: ... It was cold! I clearly remember it splashing me! Phoenix: (Could the water really make it all the way across to the other side of the room...?) Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\" Kudo: Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean, the vase on the victim's table falling upside-down and breaking? Kudo: The vase turned upside-down, and my testimony's turning this case upside-down... It's a joke! I just wanted everyone to hear it! What do you think, Captain!? Godot: ...I'm impressed. By your ability to waste time. Phoenix: (Godot hasn't raised any objections for a while now...) Kudo: So, you young show-off! With that scrap of information, I'm throwing down the gauntlet! If I lose this one, I'll take it like a man and admit defeat! Phoenix: He's really giving you the evil eye, Maya. Maya: It's you he's looking at, Nick, not me! It's like he's saying, \"I triple dog dare you to find a contradiction, young'un!\" Phoenix: I guess I'll just have to rise to the challenge then... Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene. Kudo: Hmph! So what? Phoenix: Look carefully at the table. The vase is there... intact! Kudo: Huh? Phoenix: Lost your tongue, granddad? Kudo: ... I'm no granddad of yours, hop scotch! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Judge: Enough! If you throw any more seeds in this courtroom, the cleaners will be here all night. Kudo: Aaaaaah! Judge: ... What is it now? Kudo: I just remembered something! Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Go on... Kudo: The broken vase... Ha ha! It was on my table! Phoenix: Wha...? Kudo: Ah, well... You see... It startled me when that young lad collapsed. So I stood up. That must've been when it fell over. The vase on my table, I mean. Judge: The vase on your table? Kudo: Ah ha ha! Yes, it was on my table! And that's how my groin came to be completely soaked. ......... Judge: *sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today. Kudo: Er, I'd like to ask a question now. Have I, er... Have I been any use at all? Judge: Perhaps that's something you should reflect on yourself, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Aaaargh! WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else... Judge: Bailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom! Kudo: WAAAIT! LISTEN TO MEEEEEE! Judge: Well! We seem to have been considerably sidetracked. And I am still not in a position to deliver a verdict. Phoenix: ...! Judge: The defendant has not been positively identified as the waitress in question. Additionally, there are two disparities in the testimony we have heard thus far. Phoenix: The mark on the coffee cup that the victim supposedly drank from with his left hand. And the earpiece which was inserted into his left ear, out of which he couldn't hear. Maya: Wow, Nick! You did it! Judge: I therefore require both the defense and the prosecution to further investigate the facts. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Godot: ... Judge: There is one more thing before I call today's session to an end. Phoenix: O-One more thing, Your Honor? Judge: The witness we just heard from... He is most insistent that his testimony should be of use. So he's summarized it accordingly into this statement. Phoenix: Um... OK... Judge: You may each have a copy of it, if you wish. Godot: Whatever. The prosecution doesn't need props like that. Maya: Godot's really mad, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. I would be, too. Judge: Very well. Here you are then, Mr. Wright. There are 3 copies. My own, yours, and Mr. Godot's. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Victor's Testimony added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (\"I'm sorry\"? This isn't a piece of testimony! More like a five year old's apology...) Maya: What the heck are we supposed to do with 3 copies...? Judge: That is all. This court is adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned! Recipe for Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 January 7, 12:52 PMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: So how do you think the trial went this morning? Phoenix: How do you think it went!? Maya: It got a bit crazy in there. I just wonder if that killed our chances. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess it did get out of hand. Mr. Kudo's testimony did nothing to help us. Plus, now we don't even know the identity of the waitress who laced the coffee. Maya: All we know is what old Mr. Kudo saw... The apron straps, and the ribbon. Phoenix: And that the victim was wearing an earpiece when his eardrum was ruptured. Maya: Talk about a terrifying case of contradictionitus. Phoenix: Time to play doctor and find ourselves a cure then, huh? Maya: Yeah, we've gotta find one for Maggey, or she's going to have a terminal case of guilty! Talk What to do Phoenix: Well? I'm officially at a loss as to where to start. Maya: Yeah, me too. Let's try some brainstorming. You go first. Phoenix: I guess we should try to put Mr. Kudo's testimony to some sort of use. Maya: Yeah, that's true. Phoenix: And we need to figure out the identity of the waitress and who the victim really was... Somehow, I think the key to this case has got to be at Trés Bien. Maya: Well then, let's go back there and check it out again. Oh! And we should drop in on Maggey and see how she's doing, too. Any ideas Phoenix: So... Anything on your mind? Maya: Actually, there is something... Phoenix: ...? Maya: I was wondering about Xin Eohp... You know, like what he's like and stuff. Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I almost forgot about that guy. ???: I atta beat you so hard, it'll feel like youse were smoochin' the express train! ???: Phoenix Wright? Youse sayin' YOU' Phoenix Wright? ???: Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only! Phoenix: Actually... I've learned a little something about my doppelganger. Maya: Huh? You did? What did you find out? Phoenix: (Oh, yeah, Maya was working at the restaurant when I ran into Don Foneeonay...) Let's just say he was such a terrible version of me that I wanted to sue for defamation! (What's that guy's story, anyway? What does he have to gain by impersonating me?) Present Attorney's Badge Maya: That badge is totally useless, Nick. Phoenix: Huh!? Maya: I mean, no one suspected that Xin Eohp wasn't a real lawyer. I bet he didn't have an attorney's badge! Phoenix: ...I guess you're right. Maya: Or maybe he did have one! And maybe he switched your real one for a \"fugazzi\"! Phoenix: My badge? A fake!? ... Ha ha ha... That's a good one, Maya... Maya: Why the nervous laughter? ...Aha! I knew it! Your badge really IS fake, isn't it Nick? Sports Paper Maya: This doodle here... It was drawn by the victim, right? Phoenix: This is a newspaper from the day of the incident, so, yeah, we've got to assume so. There must be a clue in there somewhere. Maya: I guess we should show it around and see if anyone can tell us more about it. Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe there's a fake Nick running around. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. What's the deal with that? Why's he impersonating me? Maya: Maybe he's got something against you. People do tend to have a distinct distaste for you, Nick. Phoenix: (True enough... The only thing prosecutors seem to like about me is pushing me around...) Maya: Or... maybe he's got something against Maggey. Phoenix: (So he pretended to be me to get Maggey convicted?) Scooter Maya: That thing must've been in an accident. It's a total wreck! Phoenix: That's what the guy I met at the park was riding. And I'm betting he's the fake me. ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only! Phoenix: His voice is still ringing in my ears. Maya: Introduce me next time, Nick! I want to meet Xin Eohp, too! Jean's Loan Contract Maya: A loan of half a million dollars! I wonder what Mr. Armstrong did to get into that much debt. Phoenix: I'm going to guess he spent money needlessly. You'd better watch your spending, too. Maya: Hey, I've got a great idea! What if Mr. Armstrong charged $20,000 for the Twin-T set? Phoenix: If you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back! Victor's Testimony Maya: A letter of apology from the old man? Aww, how sweet. Phoenix: Actually, it's his \"testimony\"... If you can call it that. Maya: So? What's it say? ...\"I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry.\"? Heh heh! I used to break things all the time when I was little, you know. And I used to have to write apologies all the time, too. Phoenix: (Well, Pearls and Adrian seem to have picked up where you left off...) Coffee Cup Maya: That's the cup the poison was in, isn't it? Phoenix: Yeah, and the stain on the rim shows that the victim used his right hand to pick it up. Maya: But the old man swore he saw the victim pick it up with his left hand... Phoenix: (If Mr. Kudo wasn't mistaken, then what could account for this contradiction...?) Victim's Lottery Ticket Maya: Maybe I should try the lottery sometime, too. Phoenix: Sure, why not? If you hit the jackpot, you could win half a million bucks. Maya: So, what are you waiting for, Nick? Buy one! Phoenix: No way! Don't you know the lottery is a tax on people who are bad at math! Maya: Blah. Fine then. At least I can add it to the newly renamed \"Paths to Wealth\"! I'll have to call Pearly later and have her add, \"Buy lottery tickets whenever possible.\" Apron Maya: It's almost surreal that this artsy apron is what got us this far. Phoenix: Well, as art goes, this piece definitely leaves an impression. Maya: I guess that means the old guy never saw the front of it, huh? Which means he didn't see the waitress's face, either... Potassium Cyanide Maya: I can't believe they found this in Maggey's pocket. Phoenix: Yeah, but she was passed out, right? So the killer could've easily planted it on her. Maya: Where do you even get a hold of something like this? It's not like you can go down to your local CostMo' and buy it in bulk for $5 a pound! Phoenix: (She has got a point... How the killer got a hold of this poison is pretty important.) Victim's Prescription Bag Maya: \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\". Hmm... I guess if your eardrum was ruptured, you couldn't listen to the radio, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. It'd be pretty pointless to wear an earpiece of any kind. Maya: The medication in the bag is missing too, right? Phoenix: (The mysterious vanishing medication... Much like our mysterious \"other person\"...) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since then. I think Mia said it's because Maya's \"at a loss these days\"...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia really bailed me out again yesterday. Maya: Argh! That seedy old man was so rude to me! He didn't realize just how awesome I am. If he had, I bet he would've treated me better. Phoenix: Since when did you become so awesome? Godot profile Maya: Godot got it good today, huh? He was even smoking at me end there! Phoenix: He'll have a new witness ready for tomorrow, though. You can count on it. (We need to figure out the facts before then, or we're doomed!) Maggey Byrde profile Maya: A lot of strange conflicting things kept popping up today in the trial, huh? Phoenix: Yeah, and they seemed to come out of nowhere. Maya: That's why we've gotta go talk with Maggey and get out this whole thing straightened out! Phoenix: (Maggey said that when she brought the victim his coffee... ...there was one more people sitting at the table. This single contradiction is probably the most important one we have to resolve...) Glen Elg profile Maya: Have you noticed the victims in our cases tend to be people we know nothing about, Nick? Take Glen Elg, for example. Phoenix: Now that you mention it... Maya: We don't know what kind of guy he was, or why he was killed. I say it's time to get out there and find some answers! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: I really felt sorry for Gumshoe today. He really wanted to help Maggey out, but he kept getting backed into a corner. Phoenix: Maggey took it pretty bad, didn't she? Do you think she feels betrayed? Maya: Maybe. We've got to cheer her up somehow. She's a friend, after all. Phoenix: (A friend? Hmm... Never really thought of it that way, but I guess she is.) Victor Kudo profile Maya: It's the seedy old man! What's his name again? Phoenix: Vermin Kudo, is it? I can't remember, either. I've never seen a witness mess up so badly in court before. Maya: Better stay away from him a while, huh? Phoenix: (Yeah. It might be more than seed that he chucks at me next time.) Jean Armstrong profile Maya: The chef's a witness too, right? Phoenix: I suppose so. He was in the kitchen at the time of the incident. Maya: Well, since Old Man Seeds's testimony is pretty much useless to us... ...I guess we should speak to Mr. Armstrong again, huh? January 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: Looks like Gumshoe's not here. Phoenix: Never mind that. What's going on? It feels different in here somehow... Maya: You think? Phoenix: Yeah. Everyone seems to be on edge. Detective: What are you doing!? Call in the officers for the briefing, quick! Can't you shut down the station's server? Chief! Quit playing on the Internet! Chief: But my e-mail pen pal, 1337aZnPrInceSz! Detective: Save it for later! I'm turning it off NOW! Chief: Noooo! 1337aZnPrInceeeeeSz!! Maya: Everyone's keeping busy in here, huh? Phoenix: Keeping busy? More like panicking, if you ask me. (Something's going on. Something big...) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Even pickpockets can have their pockets picked.\" That's a keeper! Better to go with something that doesn't sound too much like a slogan. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a crime prevention campaign... ...But I'm not sure even he knows what kind of crime he's trying to prevent. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut. Chief: Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to write her a real letter instead of an email. Phoenix: (Alternately, you could write up some reports... Just a suggestion.) Chief: \"Dear 1337aZnPrInceSz, How are you? I'm OK! How was the show last night...?\" Maya: Wow, what an awesome job! Maybe I should send in my resume and become chief! Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\"! Right, Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Um... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: I guess Maggey's still in questioning. Maya: But! But we've got questions to ask her, too! Magg-ey! Magg-ey! Phoenix: Keep it down, Maya! This isn't a playground, you know! January 7Trés Bien Maya: Empty, as usual. Phoenix: Yeah, and it's lunchtime, too. ???: That's it! Come on, come on, come on! Phoenix: Hey, that sounds like... Gumshoe: Now just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can! Maya: He's getting really worked up about something. Gumshoe: Noooooo! That's the wrong number! Argh! Look like an \"8\" would have only netted me five bucks anyway! What a rip off! Maya: What's the problem, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Huh!? Oh, it's you... I, uh... I was uh... Hah hah! I was just... Hah hah hah! I was just listening to the radio, pal. Phoenix: To the radio? Maya: Hey, Detective Gumshoe's having lunch here! Phoenix: (He is! And he's having the Twin-T set...) Gumshoe: Aha ha ha... What can I say...? Examine Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Maya: It could say \"Entrance\" or \"Exit\", too. Did you think of that? Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: Hey, Nick. Do you think Old Seedy was talking about a vase like this today in court? Phoenix: It does look like it's ready to fall over any second. Looks kind of fragile, too. Maya: I bet if Mr. Armstrong charged 10,000 dollars for every vase a customer broke... ...he'd be able to pay off his loan really quickly. Phoenix: If you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got ya! I was just kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Maya: Wow, you really can't see the table in front or behind you at all! It's the perfect setup for slipping poison into your enemy's coffee. Talk Today's trial Gumshoe: This is a nightmare! How am I supposed to look Maggey in the eye now, pal!? Maya: You really drove her into a corner, you know. Gumshoe: You always blow apart my testimony! Why, of all days, didn't you do it today!? Phoenix: S-Sorry... There just weren't any holes in it... for once! Maya: Yeah, what happened? Usually, your testimonies are like Swiss cheese! Gumshoe: S-Swiss cheese...? Phoenix: (Would he have preferred, \"crumbly like aged parmesan\"? Anyway, this case has already been ruled on. There shouldn't be any holes left to find.) Gumshoe: So... Did Maggey say anything to you? About me, I mean. Maya: Well, um... How did she put it again...? Byrde: I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again! Maya: Something like that. Gumshoe: Wah... Waaaaaaaaaah! Maya: P-Please! Detective Gumshoe! I didn't mean... Gumshoe: Why!? Why is this happening!? Maya: He's banging his head against the wall, Nick! Phoenix: (Oh, man... Poor Gumshoe...) Lunch special Phoenix: So, did you like the Twin-T set? Gumshoe: I've never paid that much money for lunch before. I was so nervous, my hands were shaking. Maya: So? How did it taste!? Gumshoe: Well... For 20 bucks, I guess... I dunno how to describe it, really. It was... delicate. Maya: Delicate? Phoenix: You mean you liked it!? It didn't taste bad to you? Gumshoe: ... Maya: What's the matter with him? Phoenix: Looks like he's thinking... Gumshoe: ... That's it! I've been trying to think of the right word to describe the taste. I just got it right now... \"Bad\"! That's it. It tasted bad! Phoenix: *sigh* Gumshoe: It's kinda hard to admit it to yourself when you pay 20 bucks though, pal. Phoenix: (Maybe he should've found out about the price AFTER he had finished eating...) Maya: Maybe that's why Glen Elg came here. Maybe he heard about the famous Twin-T set! Phoenix: (Glen Elg, the victim, huh... Which reminds me. We still hardly know anything about the guy.) Maya: Why don't we ask Gumshoe what he knows, seeing as he's here? The radio Maya: So what were you all excited about earlier? Gumshoe: Huh? Phoenix: That's right! You said you were listening to the radio or something. Gumshoe: Oh, that? That was nothing! I-I wasn't excited! Maya: Come on, Detective Gumshoe! You can tell little ol' me! What were you listening to? Gumshoe: N-Nothing, really. It was just the, um... \"Daily Exercise Show\"! 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (What the...!? A Psyche-Lock?) Gumshoe: Hah hah hah! Mmm... This lunch special's lobster is great! Maya: Then why are there tears in your eyes...? The radio (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Lock) Maya: Come on, Detective Gumshoe. You can tell us what you were listening to on the radio. Gumshoe: But I already told you. It was the, um... the... weather forecast, pal. Phoenix: (Didn't you say it was an exercise program earlier!?) 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Gumshoe: It was nothing, really. Hah hah hah! Phoenix: (Even if it's nothing, the fact that he's hiding it makes me really curious!) The radio (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Gumshoe: I'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try. Phoenix: What's with everyone and the lottery...? Maya: So? How did it go? Gumshoe: I won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad! Phoenix: (Yeah, I know the feeling.) Gumshoe: I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg, see. (Changed from [I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg.] in the original release) And they've got this special radio show where they announce the winning numbers. (Changed from [When they read those results out on the radio, it really gets your heart pumping!] in the original release) They even do the drawings live on the air! It's intense, pal! (Changed from [You know they broadcast it live when they're picking the numbers? It's intense, pal!] in the original release) Maya: I bet that's what Mr. Elg was listening to on the day he was killed. (Changed from [I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.] in the original release) Phoenix: Yeah. What time is it now? Gumshoe: Uh, it's... It's just after 1:30. Phoenix: And are the lottery results always broadcast at the same time? Gumshoe: Yeah. Look, I got this flyer when I bought the ticket. Millionaire Radio Flyer added to the Court Record. Maya: \"Millionaire Radio\"? That sounds cool! I want to try it, Nick! Phoenix: Then buy a ticket, Maya. With your own money! The radio (subsequent times) Gumshoe: I'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try. Phoenix: What's with everyone and the lottery...? Maya: So? How did it go? Gumshoe: I won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad! Phoenix: (Yeah, I know the feeling.) Gumshoe: I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg, see. (Changed from [I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg.] in the original release) And they've got this special radio show where they announce the winning numbers. (Changed from [When they read those results out on the radio, it really gets your heart pumping!] in the original release) They even do the drawings live on the air! It's intense, pal! (Changed from [You know they broadcast it live when they're picking the numbers? It's intense, pal!] in the original release) Maya: I bet that's what Mr. Elg was listening to on the day he was killed. (Changed from [I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.] in the original release) I want to try it, Nick! Phoenix: Then buy a ticket, Maya. With your own money! Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? Gumshoe: It tells me the guy is cruising for a bruising! Maya: You're really caring, aren't you, Detective Gumshoe? About Maggey, I mean. Magatama (after clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, before breaking Psyche-Lock) Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- The Radio -- Phoenix: Alright, Detective Gumshoe, tell me the truth. What were you listening to? Gumshoe: No way, pal. Now that you've made a big thing out of it, I'm not gonna tell you... Phoenix: We'll see about that, pal. Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening... ...it's pretty clear what kind of radio program it was. I'd say it was related to... Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm right, aren't I?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Detective Gumshoe!? Gumshoe: Yeah! That's it, pal! You got me. You sure are something! Phoenix: (Then how come I'm still seeing the lock? Guess I was wrong... Now, what was it he shouting when he was listening to the radio...?) Gumshoe: That's it! Come on, come on, come on! Gumshoe: Now just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can! Gumshoe: Noooooo! That's the wrong number! Phoenix: (It seems so obvious... I'd better ask him again.) Gumshoe: D-Don't tell me you're not through yet... Leads back to: \"Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening...\" Phoenix: I'm right, aren't I? You were listening to the lottery results, weren't you? You thought you'd try to win big, just like Glen Elg did! Gumshoe: I-It's... It's like you can see right through me! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (Huh? I've cracked him already...?) Gumshoe: That's why I said it was nothing! Unlock Successful Sports Paper Gumshoe: That's the sports paper the victim wrote something in, right? ... Maya: What is it? Gumshoe: I know I've heard that name somewhere before... \"MC Bomber\"... Yeah... I heard it real recently, too... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Lunch Special Gumshoe: I haven't got anything to say about that, pal. ... Just take it away already, please? Phoenix: (Spending 20 dollars on this has got to be killing him inside...) Scooter Gumshoe: Hey! Are you putting this up for sale, pal? Phoenix: N-No! Why, would you want a busted up scooter like this anyway? Maya: Yeah. Plus, the seat's all covered in pigeon poop! Gumshoe: Who cares? If it runs, that's all that matters to me. Phoenix: (My phony was riding this bike... Maybe if I head back to the park. it'll be there again.) Victim's Lottery Ticket Gumshoe: A one-way ticket to happiness, huh? Phoenix: Glen Elg died because of this ticket. Gumshoe: Yeah, but it's still a one-way ticket to happiness, pal. Phoenix: And Maggey was found guilty of murder because of it, too. Gumshoe: ... Maya: ...Looks like anything about Maggey is an instant conversation stopper. Phoenix: Yeah. He's got a real soft spot for her, and it obviously hurts when you hit it! Apron Gumshoe: That's the apron Maggey was wearing. Yeah, it still smells like her, too. Maya: Does this mean Maggey smells like ketchup? Victim's Prescription Bag Gumshoe: We never did find the contents of that bag. Maya: It was medicine for Mr. Elg's ruptured eardrum, right? Gumshoe: Yeah. We found traces of it in his left ear canal. He must've used it while he was at Trés Bien. We're sure of that much. Millionaire Radio Flyer Gumshoe: Apparently everyone's listening to this show now. Maya: That's because everyone wants money. Gumshoe: They say that the victim, Glen Elg, was really into gambling. Maya: Yep. You can't beat gambling! I love it, too! I won 500 dollars last night playing cards with Nick. Phoenix: Huh? We were playing for money!? Maya: Of course! So you'd better pay up! Gumshoe: You're a smart one! ...Waiting for a cop to be present before asking for the cash! Godot profile Gumshoe: Mr. Godot agreed to take this case just so he could face you, pal. He was working on a bunch of more important cases, but he cancelled them all... Maya: Huh? But then... ...why didn't Mr. Godot take this case... ...when Maggey's first trial came up? Phoenix: Yeah. that is kinda odd. I mean, everyone thought the defense was \"Phoenix Wright\". So why didn't he try to fight \"me\" then? Gumshoe: Well, according to Mr. Godot... ...he knew the guy was a phony right away, so he didn't want to bother with the trial. Phoenix: (He couldn't be bothered to tell the judge!?) Maggey Byrde profile Gumshoe: Maggey's probably crying all alone right now, huh... Maya: Yeah, thanks to you. Gumshoe: Aaaaaaargh! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! Phoenix: Maya! Don't torch poor Gumshoe feelings like they're are some sort of cheap crème brûlée! Maya: You're really crazy about Maggey, aren't you? Gumshoe: No! No, no! I'm just... I'm not... It's not that I... Phoenix: (You don't have to hide it, Gumshoe! It's pretty obvious.) Maya: Yeah, you're way too plain-looking for Maggey. Right? Gumshoe: I'd arrest you right now if you weren't so right... Glen Elg profile Gumshoe: This guy was a real programming genius. They called him \"the walking computer\" at the place where he worked. Maya: What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!? Phoenix: (*groan* He wasn't LITERALLY a computer, Maya!) (Changed from [*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!] in the original release) Gumshoe: Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim. Phoenix: Yeah. That's what we found out yesterday, too. Maya: Hey, Detective Gumshoe. Don't you have any information that's a bit more fun? Gumshoe: F-Fun? I, uh... Oh! I know! So, have you paid a visit to where Elg worked yet? You might as well. Maya: His workplace? Where's that? Gumshoe: A computer firm called \"Blue Screens, Inc.\" or something like that. Maya: Sounds like a real stable company. This could be fun, Nick. Let's go! Phoenix: Computers aren't really my thing, Maya. Maya: We'll be fine! I know all about that hi-tech stuff. Phoenix: (I wonder about that...) Gumshoe: It's just around the corner from this joint. You should take a look. Phoenix: (A computer firm called \"Blue Screens, Inc.\" huh...) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I know I look a little rough around the edges. But the truth is, I'm a lot more \"detective-like\" than I used to be. Maya: Really? Like what part? Gumshoe: ...Like the color of my coat. Maya: Ah! You're right! Phoenix: (Yeah, but what about what's inside the coat...?) Victor Kudo profile Gumshoe: You know, in all my years, I've never seen a witness who was that confused before. Phoenix: Yeah, you looked pretty confused by his testimony. Gumshoe: Nothing against old guys, I like them and all... But... He sounded like he was pretty sure about what he saw. Maya: Yeah, that's the impression I got, too! Phoenix: (Me, three... But then, why doesn't even a single part of his testimony corroborate any of the facts?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh lá lá! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Maya: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". But I'll tell you want. This stuff works like a charm. I slept like a rock last night. Phoenix: O-Oh, really... That's nice... Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal... I can't discuss anything connected to the case. Maya: Hey! I thought you said you were going to help us out! Gumshoe: I can't help you out if I don't have any info! Phoenix: Yeah, I suppose the retrial has only just begun... January 7Vitamin Square Maya: Hmm... I don't see any sign of Mr. Kudo. Do you? Phoenix: Maybe he went to buy another ton of bird seeds. I was kind of hoping he wouldn't be here, anyway. At least, not for now. (Besides, any more seeds today and I'm liable to turn into a real phoenix!) Examine Scooter Maya: Hey, check this out... Phoenix: I wouldn't get too close to that if I were you. Otherwise you might be in for a shock. My phony must be lurking someplace nearby... Just imagine! A Tiger, loose in the city! Maya: Meanwhile the real Phoenix is like an abandoned chick, lost in a vast urban jungle! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Don't worry. Someday, you'll grow up and become a ferocious tiger, too! Don't lose hope! Phoenix: (Why is she trying to pep-talk me into becoming my phony...?) Orange Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: Speaking of fun, if we get Maggey acquitted, may be can all get together sometime. Maya: OK! ...But what do we play with someone who's never even won a game of Tic-Tac-Toe? Phoenix: How about we change the rules a bit, then? We could play Old Maid, and... um... We could say the person who's left with the old maid at the end is the winner. How's that? Maya: Not bad... Not bad at all! We could even rename the game to \"Fair Maiden\"! January 7Trés BienKitchen Maya: Huh? Mr. Armstrong's talking to someone. ???: I'll be back next month. Armstrong: Oui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you! ???: If you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here. Armstrong: Non! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise! ???: I love fire, you know... I love the way it crackles... Hee... Hee... Hee... Armstrong: Non, non, non! Stop it! I beg you! ???: Then don't let me down... I'll be watching you... Armstrong: Mais, non! Z'is is not necessary! You can trust me, mademoiselle! ???: Talk to anyone... and I'll drive a knife... right through your heart. Armstrong: Oh, non! You do not 'ave to worry. You know, you worry far too much. Maybe z'is will 'elp you relax. It is la oil of sandalwood. ???: I do love... raw meat... from time to time... Hee... Hee... Hee... Armstrong: Aaaaah! ???: I'll be taking my leave... Goodbye... for now! Armstrong: Urgh! I 'ave la shivers! I must rub some of my oil all over my body before I become z'e nervous wreck! Z'ere. Oh, oui, oui! Z'at feels good! Phoenix: Urgh! Armstrong: Oh là là! Excusez-moi, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My eyes! My EYES! Armstrong: Your eyes? If you 'ave trouble wi'z your eyes, you need z'is. La oil of sandalwood! Phoenix: Isn't this just the leftovers of what you were just using!? Examine Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I ate yesterday for lunch? Maya: Yeah, I think it's been permanently burned into my brain now... ...as an example of what truly awful food tastes like. Phoenix: (I bet it'd taste really good if it was prepared well. ...Balsamy even!) Talk Trés Bien Phoenix: You don't exactly have many customers, do you, Mr. Armstrong? Armstrong: Non, you are right, monsieur. But per'aps z'at is la perfect time for you to visit me, non? Now I can give you my undivided attention, and cook for you la dish suprême! Phoenix: Putting on a brave face, huh? Maya: That's what girls do, Nick! Armstrong: But you are right. Business is very difficult z'ese days. Per'aps ze name is la problem. People do not understand it. Z'ey think it is \"tray\". I just wanted people to think z'at my restaurant was exclusive. Phoenix: But they think you just serve fast food on cheap, plastic trays? Maya: Nick! That's the kind of thing that can make a girl cry! Phoenix: Have you forgotten that Mr. Armstrong is a man, Maya? Armstrong: But z'is restaurant is my life! It is everything to me! I will defend it to la finale! No one will take it from me! The woman just now Phoenix: So who was that woman you were just talking to? Armstrong: Oh lá lá! You saw z'at? Phoenix: Ah, well... Yes. Sorry. Maya: So? Who was she!? She looked so polite and graceful. Armstrong: P-Polite!? G-Graceful!? Maya: And she likes raw meat and fires, right? ???: I'll be back next month. Armstrong: Oui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you! ???: If you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here. Armstrong: Non! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise! Phoenix: (Now that I think about it...) Hey, Maya... I think it's pretty clear what kind of conversation they were having. Maya: You think so? Well, then let's show him that piece of evidence and see what happens! The woman just now (appears after presenting Jean's Loan Contract) Phoenix: The woman who was here earlier... I take it that she's... um... Armstrong: Why 'as it come to z'is...? What a tragedy! Suddenly I find myself so deep in la debt. It is a sign of la bad, bad world we live in, uh? Phoenix: (No. I'd say it's more of a sign of la bad, bad culinary skills...) Armstrong: Z'e woman who was 'ere... Z'e scary woman... She is from la loan office. Phoenix: Loan office? Is that where you borrowed half a million dollars from? Armstrong: Oui. Tender Lender, it is called. Maya: Catchy name. Just hearing it makes me wanna borrow some money. Armstrong: Please! You must not borrow from z'em. If you must, no more z'an ten dollars! Phoenix: Ten dollars? Sounds like your whole monthly stipend, Maya... Maya: Hey! I get a bit more than that, thank you very much! Phoenix: So Tender Lender is the loan office you borrowed half a million from, huh? Maya: I wonder if they've got anything to do with this case... Tender Lender (appears after \"The woman just now\") Armstrong: I am a weak woman. When I am upset, I 'ave to buy something nice to cheer me up. Thanks to 'im loaning me la money, I 'ave to pay back 'alf a million dollars now! I am like 'is slave. I 'ave to do everything z'at 'e tells me. Maya: Um... Who's this he? Armstrong: La Tiger... Maya: The Tiger? Armstrong: Oui. 'E is la manager of z'e Tender Lender. A terrifying man! La big city mobster! When 'e shouts at me, my knees are trembling and 'is voice is ringing in my ears for 3 days! As soon as I 'ear la noise of z'at battered old scooter 'e rides, I start to cry! Phoenix: (A big city mobster who rides a battered old scooter...?) Um, does this guy resemble me by any chance? Armstrong: Oh, non, non, non! Z'is man 'as a presence! A most formidable personality! Although... Oui, 'e does 'ave la spikey 'air just like you. Oui, z'ere is a resemblance z'ere, I suppose. Phoenix: (Hmm... Sounds like this loan office is worth checking out after all...) Armstrong: If you want to visit z'e Tender Lender, it is just beyond Vitamin Square. Maya: Hey, Nick... If you need money, I can loan you some... As long as it's less than 3 dollars... Phoenix: Um... Thanks for the offer... (...Just beyond Vitamin Square, huh?) Present Magatama Armstrong: Oh, what a beautiful pendant! It would look stunning on me w'iz la earrings! Maya: Please don't steal it again, OK? It's one of a kind! Armstrong: I could just 'ave a sliver of it, non? Maya: I-It's not a block of cheese, you know! Sports Paper Phoenix: This is the paper the victim brought with him. Armstrong: \"MC Bomber\"...? Oui... Maya: Does that mean something to you? Armstrong: Non, I only speak French, mademoiselle. Maya: But we found it behind your magazine rack... Armstrong: Oh, 'ow naughty I am! I 'aven't cleaned for such a long time! Lunch Special Armstrong: Oh là là! So you 'ave eaten my lunch, oui? Tell me, monsieur. Did you enjoy la lunch I prepared for you? Phoenix: It was a... unique and... wild mixture of flavors. Maya: That was the first time I ever had lobster, you know! Armstrong: Lobster? Z'ere was no lobster in my lunch... Maya: Huh? But, it said, \"lobster\" right on the menu. Armstrong: Mademoiselle Maya. Please, you must read la menu more carefully. It says, \"A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with a balsamic vinaigrette. Maya: Oh. It's \"inspired\", is it? Armstrong: Oui. \"Inspired\" by z'ese ingredients, but not per'aps made from z'em, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Well, guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, Nick. Phoenix: (The way the lunch tasted, it's probably 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.) Scooter Armstrong: ... Maya: What is it? Armstrong: Is z'is your scooter? Phoenix: No, no! I saw it before in Vitamin Square, you see... Armstrong: Mon dieu! Non, non, non! Take it away! Do not show z'at to me! Phoenix: (Talk about an allergic reaction...) Jean's Loan Contract Armstrong: So long as z'at paper exists, I am but a delightful angel w'iz la broken wings! Maya: An angel, huh...? Doesn't bode well, when you think about it... Armstrong: Oui! Z'ey kept 'arassing me month after month. In z'e end, I 'ad to give in. I agreed to 'elp z'em. Maya: Help them? With what? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr, if I did not owe z'em la money, I would 'ave refused. But my 'ands were tied! Phoenix: Please! What did you agree to help them with? Armstrong: Non. I-I cannot say! If I tell you, z'at woman, she will slice me up... ...and eat me w'iz la salad garnish! Phoenix: (Eww! I hope he doesn't mean that he'll literally be sliced up and served with garnish...) I'm going to guess that woman has something to do with your loan contract. Am I right? Armstrong: Ah! Maya: Please, Mr. Armstrong, tell us about that woman! Victor's Testimony Armstrong: Ah, it is true. My vases are broken all z'e time. I bought a new one z'e next day after la incident. But z'ey wouldn't let me put it on la table because of la investigation. Victim's Lottery Ticket Armstrong: If only I 'ad taken z'e right lottery ticket... I would not 'ave any debts right now. I would be free! Maya: Look on the right side, Mr. Armstrong. You won a dollar, right? Phoenix: (A lack of remorse for having stolen something: Priceless.) Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: You 'ave la perfect face for a waitress, you know. Maya: Um, thanks. I guess if things don't work out someday, then maybe I'll be back. Phoenix: (What things? Is she talking about her being a spirit medium...?) Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Oh, 'ow it 'urts me to see z'at poor girl's face! Phoenix: Maggey's? Armstrong: I 'eard she was super'umanly un'appy. Maya: Superhumanly...? Armstrong: And if she 'adn't come to work for me, she wouldn't 'ave got into z'is mess. Phoenix: (Huh? I'm missing something here, aren't I?) Armstrong: Je suis désolé, Maggey! Forgive me! After presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien: January 7Blue Screens, Inc. Maya: Wow! This place is so hi-tech! You can almost smell the electricity in the air! Phoenix: It is a computer firm, Maya. They can't work without electricity, you know. ???: Who are you? Maya: Oh, umm... Hello... ???: I'm sorry. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only. This is a computer programming laboratory. There are far too many trade secrets that could be leaked. Maya: Wow! What secrets!? ???: Everything you see here is classified. No information can leave this building. Maya: Understood! Phoenix: (Who is this woman? She's like a robot from some kind of whacked edumacational show...) Basil: My name is Lisa Basil. I'm the company director. Phoenix: D-Director!? (Sh-She's human!? She seems more like a ghost in a shell. And that thing over her eye... Isn't that the same device as Glen Elg's?) Maya: That's an [sic] DMH, right? Phoenix: Nice try, but it's the other way around, Maya. It's an HMD. Basil: All of my programmers here at Blue Screens, Inc. are supplied with HMDs. Maya: Then do you write programs, too? Basil: No. I just enjoy wearing this. Maya: They ARE pretty cool! I wouldn't mind one! Examine Pillars Phoenix: Those pillars almost look like they're moving. It's kind of unsettling. Maya: Nah, they just look a bit twisted or warped or whatever word I'm looking for... Basil: This office was designed with a futuristic feel in mind. Maya: Futuristic? Basil: Yes. We tried to imagine what things might look like in the future when we designed it. It helps to soothe and calm the soul. Maya: ... On second thought, I agree with you, Nick. This place is really unsettling. Super computer Maya: Hey, look Nick! It's a super-computer! It looks like it's really smart and wise, doesn't it? Phoenix: Computers are only as smart as the humans who use them, Maya. Maya: That explains why we don't use the computer in our office! Phoenix: You work there too, Maya. Maya: Yeah, but at least I'm... Basil: Please. Don't argue about something that's so trivial. Otherwise the computer will laugh at you. Maya: She said she'd laugh at us, Nick. Phoenix: (She's a human, Maya, not a computer!) Programmers Phoenix: He's really pounding that keyboard, isn't he? Maya: Wow! I bet that's where the \"pro\" in \"programmer\" comes from, huh? I guess I shouldn't be resting on my laurels. Gotta expand my skill set and all that. Phoenix: Yeah, that's a good idea. Maya: Maybe I could become Old Seedy's apprentice. Phoenix: (Um... And what about your spirit medium training?) Tickets on floor Maya: Wow! Look at this mess! Phoenix: Looks like they're all betting tickets. Maya: What kind of betting tickets? Phoenix: For betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets. Maya: Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these... Phoenix: (Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.) Glen Elg's Losing Horse Racing Tickets gathered up. Maya: This many tickets would get you... what? A buck down at the recycling center? But I didn't know you were so hard up that you'd try to profit from the dead, Nick. (Changed from [You're hopeless, Nick. You know that?] in the original release) Phoenix: (I'm just taking them as evidence, Maya!) Tickets on floor (subsequent times) Maya: Wow! Look at this mess! Phoenix: Looks like they're all betting tickets. Maya: What kind of betting tickets? Phoenix: For betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets. Maya: Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these... Phoenix: (Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.) Horse calendar Maya: Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess! Phoenix: Looks pretty average to me. Maya: But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this. Phoenix: You think? Real whiz-kids can work under any condition, you know. Maya: ...! Phoenix: (She's trying to hint that I should tidy my desk more. I'll clean up my desk when Maya stops asking silly questions... No hurry then.) Maya: Hey! This calendar... Phoenix: What about it...? If this is another hint about tidying, you can forget it. Maya: Someone's marked December 3rd in red pen! Phoenix: December 3rd? That's the day Mr. Elg was murdered! Is there anything else? Maya: Yeah. Umm... It says, \"Meet with The Tiger.\" Phoenix: The T-Tiger? Glen's Calendar added to the Court Record. Horse calendar (subsequent times) Maya: Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess! Phoenix: Looks pretty average to me. Maya: But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this. Phoenix: You think? Real whiz-kids can work under any condition, you know. Maya: ...! Phoenix: (She's trying to hint that I should tidy my desk more. I'll clean up my desk when Maya stops asking silly questions... No hurry then.) Talk Blue Screens, Inc. Phoenix: So... What exactly is this firm's business? Basil: I will try to simplify it so that you can understand... We analyze the data management systems required by certain branches of industry... ...and deliver optimum operating system and source-level components. Maya: Huh? You lost me on the corner of Analyze and Management. Phoenix: It doesn't matter. They analyze stuff. You got that much, right? Basil: The software we produce is distributed on CDs. Maya: CDs...? Basil: Yes. Compact disc. Digital optical storage media. Phoenix: (Of course, CDs are used for software as well as music...) Basil: It is a small firm, but all of my employees are first-class programmers. Let's ask one of them what they are doing. Excuse me. What are you working on right now? Programmer: I'm researching the impact of time-slicing common areas in multi-threaded code on logical access to shared global variables. Obviously, program structure heavily influences response time and performance, so the co-independence of global variables and memory overheads is vitally important to the success of the execution. Basil: Well, you get the idea. This is the sort of thing we are involved in. Did you good people follow all of that? Maya: Y-Y-Yeah... Phoenix: (Your blank smile just said otherwise, Maya.) What happened Phoenix: You know about what happened, right, Ms. Basil? Basil: You mean about Glen being poisoned? Yes, I know. It's terrible. Maya: Can you tell us anything that might be helpful? Basil: I don't think so. A police officer was here earlier, too. But I couldn't tell him anything either, because... ...the waitress who committed the crime has nothing to do with Blue Screens, Inc. Maya: Oh... Phoenix: How about Mr. Elg's desk? Have you cleared it out already? Basil: No, not yet. It's the one, right in front of you. If there's anything that might be useful to you, you are welcome to take it. Phoenix: (I guess there might be a clue here somewhere...) Glen's troubles (appears after presenting Glen Elg profile) Phoenix: Um, about Mr. Elg... Was he in some kind of trouble? Basil: I'm sorry? Why would you think that? Phoenix: I thought you said something about it just now? You said he got himself into trouble because he was a bit of a \"loser\". Basil: ... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Three Psyche-Locks?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock?] in the original release) Maya: I guess Mr. Elg is like every other man with his pile of secrets. Glen's troubles (subsequent times) Phoenix: Please tell us more about the trouble that Mr. Elg was in. Basil: I'm sorry. I don't know anything about that. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Basil: I do not pry into other people's affairs. Maya: She just gave us the dreaded \"professional, business-like cold-shoulder\", huh? Phoenix: (I need to find out exactly what the victim was involved in. Looks like I've got to break her in a \"professional, business-like\" manner!) Present Glen Elg profile Phoenix: Um, about Mr. Elg... Basil: He was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. But he did suffer from one or two bugs in his personality. Maya: Oh? Like what? Basil: He was a bit of a \"loser\"... Perhaps that would be the best way to describe it. That's what got him into trouble... ... Maya: What's the matter? Basil: He was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. So he was really no trouble at all. A model employee. Phoenix: Hey, wait a minute! Just now you said something about him being in trouble! (We've got to find out what this trouble was exactly.) Anything else Maya: Umm, would you mind taking a look at this? Basil: I'm sorry. That data is SuPer-Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected. Maya: SuPer Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected!? What!? This is madness! Phoenix: No, Maya. That is SPARDA. She won't tell us unless we say the right code word. Maya: A code word? Hmm... ... Sesame! Basil: ... Maya: If it's not \"sesame\", then it must be her mother's maiden name. That's how it always is. Phoenix: There's no point in having a password if it's always the same thing, Maya. (I guess she just doesn't want to talk about this.) Maya: Maybe we should focus on asking about Glen Elg. What do you say? Trés Bien Present Lisa Basil profile Gumshoe: That lady is the boss of Blue Screens, Inc., pal. Yeah... I figure she's clean. She got nothing to hide. She seemed kinda like a doll to me. In a good way and a bad way. ... Kinda makes you think she might be hiding something. Trés Bien (after breaking Psyche-Lock, then clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien, and clearing \"Tender Lender\" Talk option in Trés Bien - Kitchen) Gumshoe: Well, I'm gonna head back to the precinct now. We've got a big meeting starting in a bit. Maya: About Maggey's case, you mean? Gumshoe: No, that's pretty much wrapped up now... There's another big case going down at the moment, so she's been pushed aside... Maya: OK. Well, see you later then. Gumshoe: Bye! Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... Phoenix: ......... Y-You better get going, Detective, or you'll be late. Gumshoe: Actually, I, um... I've kinda got a favor to ask. It's a big one! Phoenix: A favor? Gumshoe: Yeah... It's for, um... Maggey, actually. I was kinda hoping... you'd give this to her for me. Maya: What is it? Gumshoe: It's a lunchbox. I got up early so I could make it. I've been real worried about her. She looked like she'd lost a lot of weight. Maya: Detective Gumshoe... ... How many weenies are in here!? There's not a person on earth who could down this much meat. Gumshoe: You think? I love weenies. I can't get enough of their tender juiciness. So will you give to her? It took me ages to make, so please say you will, pal! Phoenix: (I can't exactly say no, can I?) Gumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya to carry. Maya: Maybe I'll eat it myself if I get hungry! Gumshoe: Don't forget, OK? I'm counting on you to give that to Maggey. Phoenix: (He's finally gone...) January 7Tender Lender Maya: ...This place gives off a really strange vibe, doesn't it? Phoenix: Looks like \"The Tiger\" isn't in his lair. (And that is, as they say, a very good thing.) ???: ...Welcome... Phoenix: *gulp* (Talk about a creepy voice! It makes your soul want to shrivel up and die!) ???: You're here... to discuss a loan...? Phoenix: Uh, no. Not exactly... ???: The manager is away at the moment... Wait quietly... please... Maya: She's gone! Just like that! Phoenix: I guess we'll just have to come back another time. Maya: But this is the perfect opportunity, Nick! This place reeks of suspicion! Come on, Nick! Let's take a look around, OK? Phoenix: Do you think it'd be OK...? Maya: Of course! No one will ever know... ???: ...Coffee...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll leave it here for you to enjoy... Quietly. Phoenix: Y-Yes! Thank you! ???: Do not touch the desk... Please... Maya: N-N-Nick! Let's g-get out of here! Phoenix: (NOW she wants to get out of here...) Examine Desk on rug Phoenix: That's one impressive desk on one impressive rug! Maya: It's solid gold, Nick! Gold! Just look at that shine! Only real gold shines like that. Phoenix: Would you really want such a shiny desk, though? Maya: I don't know, but let's see what it's like to sit at a solid gold desk... Wow! I'm completely dazzled! Phoenix: That's because it's completely dazzling! Maya: I can see up my nose in the reflection! That's gotta be really distracting! Phoenix: (So the desk isn't practical. No surprise there.) Punching bag Maya: What's this? Phoenix: It's a punching bag. Maya: What!? No way. You wouldn't catch me walking around with a bag like that! Phoenix: What do you mean, \"walking around\"? Maya: The design's gross to start with, and it's way too heavy to be practical. And why's it called a \"punching\"-bag? Don't people know messenger bags are in! I knew it. I was right before, back at Trés Bien. Paris fashion is more my thing. Phoenix: (I really, really hope she's pulling my chain on this one.) CD player Phoenix: There's a CD player on the desk. But the desk is so loud, it's a wonder you can hear it. Maya: The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into. ???: Have you finished... ...the coffee? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Y-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely. ???: ... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... *gulp* ???: ...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup... Phoenix: (Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!) Maya: Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast... Phoenix: I-I sure hope so... (We better take a look at that CD while we're still alive and have the chance...) What the...!? Maya: What!? It's not the Rocko soundtrack, is it? Claw of the Tiger? Phoenix: It's... It's a demo CD... The artist's name has been hand-written on the disc in pen. \"MC Bomber\"... Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (This must be the CD Maggey told us about!) Maya: Let's listen to it! I bet it's heavy metal! Phoenix: No way! That woman'll make us drink more coffee if we do! MC Bomber added to the Court Record. CD player (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a CD player on the desk. But the desk is so loud, it's a wonder you can hear it. Maya: The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into. ???: Have you finished... ...the coffee? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Y-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely. ???: ... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... *gulp* ???: ...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup... Phoenix: (Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!) Maya: Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast... Phoenix: I-I sure hope so... Items on bookshelf Maya: Let's see... This round doll thing is called a \"daruma\"... I think. I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering. Phoenix: You mean you aren't making stuff up for a change? Maya: Heh. I bet you also didn't know that no matter what, he'll always right himself. Go on, Nick! Give him a good shove! Phoenix: Only if I feel like dying! Maya: Now, this yellow thing... This is a Japanese chess piece. I think it's a \"king\"? Not that I'm an expert or anything... I'm more of a Reversi person, you know. Phoenix: (Assuming she knows what she's talking about, these aren't exactly your typical... ...\"mobster wannabe\" items. They're not... \"trophies\", are they...? *gulp*) Maya: Hey... There's a piece of paper sticking out from under here. Phoenix: What is it? ...A repair bill? (Looks like he did some repair work on his car... Does he even have one...?) $15,000 to replace a bumper and a light!? That's insane! Maya: The car's registered to... the \"Cadaverinis\"? Phoenix: Huh? So it's not even The Tiger's car? (Why would someone else's repair bill be in The Tiger's office...?) Repair Bill added to the Court Record. Items on bookshelf (subsequent times) Maya: Let's see... This round doll thing is called a \"daruma\"... I think. I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering. Phoenix: You mean you aren't making stuff up for a change?

Phoenix: (Assuming she knows what she's talking about, these aren't exactly your typical... ...\"mobster wannabe\" items. They're not... \"trophies\", are they...? *gulp*) Frame Phoenix: \"Win Through Compromise\"...? Maya: I wonder what that's supposed to mean... Phoenix: It must mean something if they took the trouble to frame it like that. Maya: Yeah well, it still doesn't make any sense to me... ???: ...That... Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: That's Tender Lender's guiding principle. Maya: Oh? ???: \"Compromise the customer to win.\" Maya: O-Oh, I see... How about you, Nick...? Phoenix: Yeah, umm... Well, as long as we don't have to compromise my hair, I'd say we're OK... (That's one slogan no business owner should ever explain to their customers... *shudder*) Spilled ashtray Maya: Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up. Phoenix: Yeah. It's all over the rug and everything. Maya: I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal. Phoenix: (How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?) Maya: Oh, hey! There's a book of matches here, too! Phoenix: Matches, huh? Places don't give those out much nowadays. ...Hey, wait a second! Maya: What is it? Phoenix: Look what's printed on its cover! It says, \"Trés Bien\"! (Changed from [Look what's printed on the back! It says, 'Trés Bien'!] in the original release) Trés Bien Matches added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (These matches could come in handy. We might be able to use them...) Maya: Yeah. The pilot light for the office boiler keeps going out. Phoenix: Swing and a miss, Maya. Swing and a miss. Spilled ashtray (subsequent times) Maya: Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up. Phoenix: Yeah. It's all over the rug and everything. Maya: I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal. Phoenix: (How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?) Hanging clothes Maya: Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic! Phoenix: (Looks more like a pimp coat to me... Guess I haven't got an eye for fashion.) Maya: Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick. Phoenix: Hmm... The same color as my suit...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Keep your voice down, Maya! Maya: N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this! ???: Some cake...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll just leave it here for you... Maya: Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks... ???: Just wait here quietly... Otherwise... Maya: S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said! Phoenix: Y-Yeah! Sure! ???: I have my eye on you... Only so I can \"take care of you\".... Understand...? Maya: Aah! I'm scared, Nick! Phoenix: ...So? What were you getting so excited about before? Maya: Look, on the lapel of this suit... Phoenix: That's...! That's an attorney's badge! Maya: Is The Tiger a lawyer!? Phoenix: No way! Look at this thing! It's made of paper! (Changed from [No way! Look at this badge! It's made of paper!] in the original release) Paper Badge added to the Court Record. Maya: For some reason, your badge suddenly looks really cheap to me, Nick. Phoenix: (Why doesn't anyone recognize an obviously fake badge when they see one...?) Hanging clothes (subsequent times) Maya: Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic! Phoenix: (Looks more like a pimp coat to me... Guess I haven't got an eye for fashion.) Maya: Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick. Phoenix: Hmm... The same color as my suit...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Keep your voice down, Maya! Maya: N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this! ???: Some cake...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll just leave it here for you... Maya: Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks... ???: Just wait here quietly... Otherwise... Maya: S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said! Phoenix: Y-Yeah! Sure! ???: I have my eye on you... Only so I can \"take care of you\".... Understand...? Maya: Aah! I'm scared, Nick! After examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes: ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Come out from under the desk, Maya!) The Tiger: Whad are youse two snoopin' around in my office for!? Phoenix: N-Nothing. W-We were just... The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! My precious carpet! Youse got ash on my rug! You' gonna wish your ugly feet never came through my door! Phoenix: I-It wasn't us! It was already like th-- The Tiger: Youse wanna argue with me!? Is that what you' doin'? You dink youse can take me on!? I'm gonna flatten youse two into pancakes and turn youse into my new rugs! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: ...Oh... Don Tigre... You're back... Phoenix: (Ack... That voice... It's like evil seeping into your head through your ears...) ???: ...I'm sorry... Don Tigre... I knocked over that ashtray before... and... Phoenix: (Eek! Has she got a death wish or what!?) The Tiger: ... Oh, right. Phoenix: Huh? The Tiger: F-Forget about it, Violetta. I-It's noddin'... Phoenix: (What, what, what!?) The Tiger: I ain't gonna get mad at you. You' too cute, you hear! Phoenix: (That's so unfair!) ???: Here... Have some cookies... I just baked them... And you'll need some strong espresso... while you're discussing your loan... The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: Y-Yes!? The Tiger: Youse either crazy or just plain stupid to chase after me! I worked so hard, but now youse gotta come and mess up my plan... Phoenix: (So it was him... He's my phony...) The Tiger: Heh, but I don't care. No one gets in my way! Phoenix: Wh-What? I mean, e-excuse me? The Tiger: Heh heh heh! Youse shoulda left de little girl at home, Wright. Phoenix: Um... I have a few things I want to ask-- The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! The Tiger: No questions! Dis is de last time we meet! Phoenix: Ack! Wait! P-Please! Maya: ...That was pretty weak, Nick. You waited until he was out of earshot before you shouted after him. Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk! I didn't hear you scream, \"Hold it!\" either!) ???: ...The espresso... Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: ...And cookies... Phoenix: (This woman is definitely not good for my heart. Now, what was it The Tiger called her...? \"Violetta\"?) Talk Tender Lender Phoenix: So... I'm kind of curious about your company, Tender Lender... Violetta: ...With the warm and friendly atmosphere you'd expect from a family-sized business... ...a conscientious rate of interest... and an attractive repayment policy... Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling this sentence is not going to end well...?) Violetta: ...we will tenderly lend you that little bit extra, here at Tender Lender. Maya: Hey, Nick. Things are a bit tight for Wright and Co. at the moment, aren't they? I mean there's that 500 dollars you owe me from our card game for starters. Why don't you take out a loan? Phoenix: (Would I like to take out a loan from a place like this? Not so much...) Violetta: Tender Lender is... on your side... Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: So, um, let's say I'm late with my repayment... What happens then? Violetta: ...We'd give you more coffee... ...Strong coffee... Phoenix: Um, right... I think I'd rather skip down! Maya: Hey! Just remember I can make strong coffee too, Nick! Strong tea, as well! What happened Phoenix: So, um, do you know about the incident we're investigating? Violetta: What incident...? Maya: Well, a man was poisoned in a restaurant just near here. That incident. Violetta: Let me see... I was here that day, with the manager... Phoenix: The manager being The Tiger...? Violetta: ...Furio Tigre... Maya: F-Furio... Phoenix: ...T-Tigre? (So that's where the \"Tiger\" thing comes from...) Maya: Xin Eohp's got a real name! Nick! Hurry up and find out more about him! Saved your life? (appears after presenting Furio Tigre profile) Violetta: I'm very... frail, you see... Just recently, I... died... Once... Hee... Hee... Maya: You d-died!? Violetta: About 4 months ago... The doctors said to... abandon all hope... Phoenix: (I guess they were expecting her to take a boat ride across the River Styx.) Violetta: But Don Tigre... He saved me. He gave up everything... Maya: Everything!? Violetta: When I found out what he had done for me, I... was happy... Maya: No offense, but I'm finding that a little hard to believe. Violetta: I decided I'd pay him back... with my life... by serving him coffee... and espresso... Phoenix: (I still wonder about what's in her coffee...) So... is that why you've got that bandage around your head? Violetta: Hee... Hee... Hee... This? The head bandage (appears after \"Saved your life?\") Phoenix: Um, so what's the story with the bandage? Violetta: ... They put it on after the operation... Maya: Operation? Violetta: It's just a little injury... A little, fatal, injury... Hee... Hee... Hee... Maya: A f-f-fatal injury!? Phoenix: (Maya just suffered one herself, by the sound of it...) So, that's the injury you were talking about before when you said you had died once? Violetta: ... 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: ...! Maya: Urgh! She really creeps me out, Nick! Phoenix: (Same here. But we've got to find out the truth!) The head bandage (subsequent times) Violetta: It was very complicated... The operation... They opened up my head... And performed surgery on my frontal lobe... Maya: Urgh! Just thinking about it sends shivers down my spine! Phoenix: So how did you get this \"fatal injury\" that left you needing an operation? 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Violetta: I made a promise to Don Tigre... I said I would never tell... Cross my heart and hope to drink 100 cups of espresso... Phoenix: Oh. (That much caffeine would raise anyone from the dead!) Violetta: Besides... It's a very precious memory to me... Phoenix: A... A precious memory...? (I'll never find out what she means if I can't break her...) Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Can I ask you about The Tiger, I mean, Mr. Tigre? Violetta: ...Cookie...? Maya: S-Sure...? Violetta: How do you like my cookies? I baked them myself... Hee... Hee... Hee... Maya: Go ahead, Nick! The honor is all yours! Phoenix: No, no! Ladies first, Maya! Violetta: Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: (No matter how I look at this, I just don't get it... What are The Tiger and this scary girl doing working together?) Violetta: We... are lovers... Phoenix: (That's not exactly coming across in your tone of voice...) Violetta: And I owe Don Tigre my life... He's the one who saved me... Phoenix: The Tiger... saved you...!? Violetta: Please, address him properly as \"Don Tigre\". Otherwise, I'll have to... Phoenix: OK, OK! Don Tigre! Of course! I'm sorry. (He saved her life? I'd sure like to how that happened.) Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Violetta: More coffee...? You must have more... Phoenix: No! Um, thanks! I've had enough. Really! (I'm so thirsty!) Violetta: I don't leave the office... I can't tell you about anything... except Don Tigre. January 7Vitamin Square Maya: There he is! Old Seedy's back feeding the pigeons again! Kudo: There! Take this! And this! And get out of my park! Phoenix: Like I thought, he's really mad... Come on, Maya. Just keep your head down and let's sneak away while we still can... Maya: What? Why? Hellooo, old man! Phoenix: What are you doing, Maya!? Kudo: Huh!? ...Kah! Maya: Hey, he just turned his back on us! Phoenix: I'm not surprised. I bet I really hurt his pride in court this morning. Maya: Hey, Mr. Kudo! Kudo: Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Hmm, pi-pi-pigeon, hmm... Kah! Maya: Look, we really need to talk to you, alright? Kudo: Out with the demons! In with good fortune! Maya: Ow! Ow! Ow! Seeds... Shell splinters... Painful... Phoenix: I always knew you were a demon, Maya! Talk Today's trial Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry about what happened in court earlier today. Kudo: Kah! Everyone'll be talking about me behind my back now! A dirty old man who was so busy looking at the serving girl's backside... ...that he can't remember her face! A filthy, depraved animal! Phoenix: N-Not at all! Kudo: Are you listening to me, boy!? I don't care what you say, I saw that waitress put it in! She put some white powder into the young lad's javaccino! Maya: We hear you... Kudo: And another thing! The young layabout was wearing an earpiece! On the same side as the lens of his broken spectacles! Maya: W-We're really sorry... Kudo: So I made a little mistake about the vase. So what!? I know what I saw! I tell you, I tell you, I tell you! Phoenix: OK, OK! Take it easy, please, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Don't tell me to take it easy, you spikey-haired brat! Take this! Embroiderer Maya: Um... You said you were a craftsman, right? Kudo: Kah! The modern world casts honest craftsmen like me aside in droves! Maya: S-Surely it's not that... Kudo: I come from a long line of craftsmen. Right back to the time of the shoguns! Do you hear me!? I didn't become an embroiderer, I was BORN one! Maya: Actually... I'm kind of in the same situation myself. Kudo: I... I... I wanted to stick my fingers up that dribbling old judge's nose... ...and scream right down his earhole... \"Objection!\" Maya: Oh... So, did you want to become a lawyer when you were young...? Phoenix: I don't think that's quite it, Maya. I think he's just in a bad mood, that's all... Kudo: I've got a tsunami of frustration inside and it's ready to burst out! Phoenix: (If we let him start rambling now, we might never shut him up! What should I do?) Cut in Phoenix: Um, actually, we've got places to go, things to check and stuff... Maybe another time? Kudo: Fine! Whatever! Just don't forget! I've got a tsunami's worth of grumbling to do. Phoenix: Yes, yes. This girl right here is really looking forward to hearing it all. Honest! Maya: What!? I never said that! Kudo: Come to the place where I work, then. Here. Bring this along with you. Phoenix: (What is this? It's covered in seeds... A discount coupon for a burger!?) Maya: He really wants someone to grumble at, huh? ...Although, it IS a burger joint... Leads back to Talk options Suck it up Phoenix: (Guess I better let him talk...) So, there's not much call for craftsmen these days, then? Kudo: Of course not, you idiot! All I'm good for nowadays is running errands! Maya: Errands? Kudo: Everyone takes advantage of the elderly! \"Buy some bread, gramps!\" \"Take the dog for a walk, granddad!\" \"Feed the pigeons, old man!\" What am I? Some sort of two-bit community handyman!? Maya: Um, well... Kudo: \"Buy some bread\", now that I can understand. But what's the point of feeding some seedy pigeons!? Why don't people say what they mean!? \"Get lost!\" That's what they're trying to say! Oh, yes! I'm just an inconvenience, you see! At home... At that restaurant... I just get in the way, don't I!? Phoenix: I-I'm sure you don't. (Wait a minute! What did he just say? At home and... at that restaurant?) Hold up... By \"restaurant\", are you talking about Trés Bien? Did you get asked to run an errand there, too? Kudo: Yes, I did! The very day that young brat was poisoned. Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? Leads back to Talk options The \"errand\" (appears after selecting \"Suck it up\" upon selecting \"Embroiderer\" Talk option) Phoenix: So on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do? Kudo: Glad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me. Armstrong: \"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!\" Kudo: \"Call them yourself!\" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time. Maya: So, did you end up calling the police? Kudo: Like I said, I was in a bit of a daze. Phoenix: Did you call them on your cell phone? Kudo: Kah! Do I look like I'd have one of those new-fangled thingamajigs? I went out looking for a pay phone, of course! Maya: You went looking for one...? Kudo: I couldn't find one right away, you know. Wandered around for 5 minutes or so. Maya: F-Five minutes...? Phoenix: So for five minutes after the incident happened... Kudo: Yessiree, the owner was at Trés Bien on his own. Phoenix: Why didn't you mention this in court this morning? Kudo: Well, I would have if you'd given me the chance! But you all bullied me out of the courtroom! Judge: *sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today. Kudo: WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else... Judge: Bailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom! Kudo: It's not my fault! You're the ones to blame! Phoenix: You could have at least told us before we got to court. Maya: Is it really that important that Mr. Kudo was the one who called the police...? Phoenix: (What's important is the unaccounted time before the police arrived. The victim was dead, and Maggey was unconscious. Which leaves that woman... I mean, that man, alone in the restaurant!) Mr. Kudo might have been chased out of the place on purpose. Maya: What do you mean? Phoenix: Maybe a certain someone didn't want him in the restaurant. Maya: Ah! Kudo: Oh, sure! You go ahead and say I was in the way as usual! I suppose I should've been getting myself covered in pigeon poop instead, hmm? Phoenix: (We need to get more details about what exactly happened... ...from Maggey... and from Mr. Armstrong!) The \"errand\" (subsequent times) Phoenix: So on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do? Kudo: Glad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me. Armstrong: \"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!\" Kudo: \"Call them yourself!\" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time. Maya: So, did you end up calling the police? Kudo: Like I said, I was in a bit of a daze. Phoenix: Did you call them on your cell phone? Kudo: Kah! Do I look like I'd have one of those new-fangled thingamajigs? I went out looking for a pay phone, of course! Maya: You went looking for one...? Kudo: I couldn't find one right away, you know. Wandered around for 5 minutes or so. Maya: F-Five minutes...? Phoenix: So for five minutes after the incident happened... Kudo: Yessiree, the owner was at Trés Bien on his own. Present Anything Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this? Kudo: ... Kah! Phoenix: Excuse me... Kudo: You let me get a million of my grumbles off my chest, and I'll take one quick look. I've got an earthquake of frustration inside and it's ready to rumble! Phoenix: ...On second thought, forget it. A million grumbles for one quick look doesn't sound like a good deal... for me. After clearing \"The \"errand\"\" Talk option in Vitamin Square: January 7Trés BienKitchen Maya: Looks like Mr. Armstrong's out again. Phoenix: But the place is open for business... You can't have an open restaurant without a chef! Maya: Hey! It's not my fault, Nick! Don't take it out on me! Phoenix: (Only a couple of minutes after the incident happened... Mr. Kudo left the scene, leaving Mr. Armstrong here alone.) Maya: Argh... Missing when we need to talk to him the most. Phoenix: (Maybe he's trying to avoid us on purpose?) After breaking Psyche-Lock, clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien: January 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room Byrde: Oh, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Hello, Maggey. So they finished questioning you? Byrde: Wasn't it just unbelievable in court today, sir!? I'm going to stay up all night and blog about everything that happened! Maya: Weren't you scared? It was pretty touch and go in there. Byrde: Yeah, but you totally nailed that old man! Phoenix: Well, he was all over the place with his testimony. Byrde: He's not the only one! Maya: Huh? What do you mean? Byrde: Everyone else's testimonies don't match up either. Not with what I remember of the incident, anyway... Phoenix: (Is it possible she is the one misremembering things...?) Talk Contradictions Maya: Maggey... You know how you said that everyone else... ...provided testimony that didn't match up with what you remembered? Byrde: Yup. There are just so many things that don't seem to add up. The biggest contradiction is the other guy I saw at the victim's table. HE was the one who slipped something into the victim's coffee. I'm sure it was him! Phoenix: (But didn't Mr. Kudo testify earlier today... ...that it was the waitress who put some white powder into the coffee cup...?) Maya: So you really think it was this \"disappearing man\" that did it...? Byrde: Well, he's not the only thing that disappeared. The CD vanished as well. You know, the CD with the writing on it. Maya: Oh, yeah. The \"MC Screwdriver\" album, right? Phoenix: It was \"MC Bomber\", Maya. That name was scrawled on the sports paper as well. Byrde: They never did find that CD at the crime scene, sir. Phoenix: (Or the victim's medication. That's gone missing, too.) Maya: Ouch, my head... This is getting way too complicated for me! After the incident Phoenix: You said that you passed out when the victim, Glen Elg, collapsed, right? Byrde: Yes. It's so embarrassing. I mean, I used to be a cop! When I came to, the restaurant was buzzing with police. And before I knew what was going on, they arrested me, sir. Phoenix: So between the time the victim collapsed and the time the police arrived on the scene... ...you have no idea what went on at Trés Bien. Byrde: No. No idea at all. Why? Is it important, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The other witness, the old man from the park, was pretty much chased out of the picture. Byrde: \"Chased out of the picture\"? What do you mean? Maya: Old Seedy wasn't inside the restaurant because he was told to go call the police. Phoenix: Exactly. And you, Maggey, were unconscious. That means Mr. Armstrong was alone in the restaurant for a brief period of time. Byrde: No... Y-You don't think Mr. Armstrong... set me up... do you? Phoenix: When you consider the facts... ...it's hard to imagine that Mr. Armstrong isn't involved in this at all. Byrde: Grr! It's like the master biting the paw of the dog that it feeds! Are you sure about this, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Well, the old man said as much when we spoke with him earlier. Byrde: I don't know. The things that man says don't add up for some reason, sir... Phoenix: (Maggey looks like she's trying to figure something out...) Maya: We'd better find outexactly what happened to the old man on that day. Victor's testimony (appears after presenting Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile) Phoenix: Is there anything about Mr. Kudo's testimony that stood out as odd to you? Byrde: Actually... Yes. The fact that he was even testifying to begin with doesn't quite... Maya: ...? \"Doesn't quite\" what? Byrde: Well, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant. Phoenix: (Yeah, we know that already. It was Victor Kudo.) Byrde: But I can't really say it was an old man. Maya: OK, then how about calling him a really old middle-aged man! Byrde: No, age isn't the issue. The other customer was a woman. Phoenix: A woman!? Maya: Are you sure, Maggey!? Byrde: Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I think so. Maya: So? What did this woman look like? Byrde: Umm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh. Phoenix: \"Creepy\"? Maya: \"Cackling\"? Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling I've come across a woman like that recently?) Present Sports Paper Byrde: That's the paper the victim had with him, isn't it? Maya: That's what we think, madam. Byrde: I kind of remember him having a paper, actually. And I remember something about this \"MC Bomber\", too. Maya: It was written on the CD that disappeared as well, wasn't it? Byrde: I don't suppose it makes any difference if there was one CD or two, right? Magazine Clipping Byrde: Just thinking about the trial that day gives me the creeps. Maya: Was it that bad? Phoenix: D-Don't forget that was my phony, not me! Byrde: He was supposed to say, \"Surely the defendant isn't the real criminal!\" But instead he shouted out, \"Surely the defendant is the real criminal!\" ...By mistake. Maya: Oh, ouch. Phoenix: L-Like I said, that was my phony, not me! Byrde: I...! I don't want to think about it anymore... Phoenix: (Trust me, neither do I...) Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile Byrde: Ah, I feel much better after the trial this morning. I've been a bit of a courtroom proceedings addict for years now. It feels like forever since I was a witness as slippery as that old man. Maya: He's not really that bad of an old man though. Byrde: Still, I feel a bit uneasy. Maya: Huh? I thought you just said you felt much better... Phoenix: Maggey. If there's something on your mind, you've got to tell us. Especially if it has anything to do with Mr. Kudo or his testimony. Byrde: Roger! I'll spill it all and see what you make of it! Coffee Cup Byrde: That's the cup I took over to the table, sir. But! I didn't put anything in it... I just... I could never do something like that! Maya: That's right! You could never do anything like that! Byrde: I'm not good at carrying those large trays, you know. Trying to balance a tray with one hand to put something in the coffee with the other... That'd just be asking for trouble. I'd drop something, for sure! Maya: Th-That's right! Phoenix: (...I-Is she expecting me to claim that she's too clumsy to have committed the crime...?) Apron Byrde: Oh, yeah. That's from when I was carrying a customer's breakfast over to them. Phoenix: The ketchup splotch, you mean? Byrde: My whole face was fire-engine red, thanks to that stuff. Maya: But you spilled the ketchup in your apron, didn't you? I don't see how... Byrde: The ketchup-covered omelet went flying and hit the customer in the face. Maya: Oh, talk about a tomato-red face! Makes me wish I could've seen it myself. Byrde: Yeah, I guess... It was kind of a sight to behold. Potassium Cyanide Byrde: Potassium cyanide? I've never heard of that poison before in my life, sir! Phoenix: ... Byrde: OK, maybe I have. But I've never seen it before. That's the truth. I wouldn't even know where the nearest potassium cyanide dealer is in the first place. Maya: Potassium cyanide dealers? Sounds like another group of drug pushers to avoid... Phoenix: In any case, this definitely isn't something you can pick up just anywhere. Byrde: Ooh!! Curse my rotten luck! The criminal must've stuck the bottle in my apron while I was unconscious! Gumshoe's Lunchbox Phoenix: Oh, yeah! I've got something you're going to love! Byrde: Really? What is it!? Phoenix: A lunchbox, just for you. Here! Byrde: Wow! A lunchbox! Weenies, too! I can't believe it! Thank you, sir! Did you make this just for me, Mr. Wright? Maya: Nah, it was Detective Gumshoe! Who else would make such a nice lunchbox for you? Byrde: Detective Gumshoe? Maya: He's really worried about you. Looks like he put a lot of effort into making this, too! Byrde: ... I can't accept it. Detention Center rules. No gifts allowed, sir. Phoenix: Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't be like that. Byrde: The rules are the rules! They'll lock you up if you break them. Phoenix: (Somehow, when an ex-cop turned waitress says that, it seems a whole lot scarier.) Byrde: And anyway... I hate weenies! Maya: O-Oh... really? Byrde: It's all yours, Maya! You can enjoy it with Mr. Wright! Maya: B-But... Phoenix: ... She's right... It's better than letting it go to waste. Maya: But! ...I guess so. Gumshoe's Lunchbox eaten with Maya. Byrde: ... Well? How was it? Phoenix: That hit the spot! I love weenies. Byrde: Oh, good! I'm glad I gave it to you, then, sir! Paper Badge Byrde: Ah! Is that... your attorney's badge? Phoenix: Actually, it's a fake. Byrde: Hoooly smokes! That's it!! Maya: Huh? Byrde: That's the badge your phony had, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: You got duped by this...!? Maya: But it's a completely different color! Phoenix: And what about the fact that it's made of paper!? Byrde: He said the badge got a tan as well, while he was in Hawaii on business. Phoenix: (I'm beginning to see how my phony was able to gain her trust...) Glen Elg profile Byrde: Ah! That's the victim, isn't it? Phoenix: That day was the first time you'd ever seen this man, right? Byrde: Yes. I'd never met or seen him before then. I just happened to be the waitress who served him his coffee, sir. That's all! Phoenix: It seems he was a computer programmer. Byrde: Really? I'm useless with computers. Completely hopeless. I don't know any computer programs. Phoenix: (Did she mean \"programmers\"?) Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Back when I was an officer, Detective Gumshoe always looked out for me. But today! Today I was the one who had to look out for him; trying to incriminate me the whole time! Phoenix: You've got to remember, Maggey. Gumshoe's a detective. He's got a job to do. Byrde: My old boss... I thought at least he'd be on my side. Maya: He is on your side! He'd do anything to help y-- Byrde: You can't fool me! I saw him in court today! I felt like a poor little baby woodpecker being pecked on the head by its own mother! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's testimony was pretty solid... No wonder it hurt her so much.) Byrde: I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again! Phoenix: (Ouch. I think I just saw Gumshoe's chances go down in flames like the Hindenburg...) Maya: I don't think it's getting through to her that he really was trying to help... Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Mr. Armstrong was very good to me after I was fired from the force. I can't believe someone as nice as him could have anything to do with this... Phoenix: (Well, in the time between the victim being poisoned and the police being called... ...the only person who was on the scene and had a chance to do anything... ...was Mr. Armstrong. There was no one else there.) Byrde: M-Mr. Armstrong wouldn't... He wouldn't set me up... would he!? Furio Tigre profile Byrde: Hoooly smokes! That's him!! Maya: Huh? Byrde: That's your phony, Mr. Wright! Just look at that ridiculous suntan! Phoenix: Um... For the record, I'm not sunburned like an over-dried tomato so I don't know... Byrde: He told me he'd been on a business trip to Hawaii and that's where he got the tan. Phoenix: (I'm not hearing this...) Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be in the police force. But I'm incarcerated, now. I don't pick up much information in here. All I can help you out with now is the menu at Trés Bien. Maya: Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't let your spirits fall! After examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes in Tender Lender, and clearing \"Victor's testimony\" Talk option and presenting Gumshoe's Lunchbox in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Detective: The main server just went up in smoke! Why the heck isn't the press conference set up yet!? The Superintendent's here already! Chief: Yeah. And there's a problem with the Internet, too. Detective: I already told you to stop using your computer, Chief! Chief: But I'm watching videos online! I'm catching up on my Asian soap operas! Detective: It's gonna have to wait, Chief. I'm throwing the switch! Chief: Nooo! Just when Sum Yung-Gai was about to confess to his son's hot-to-trot girlfriend! Maya: Wow! This place is really buzzing. Phoenix: Something must be going down. Something really big. Gumshoe: Huh!? What are you doing here, pal? Maya: Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: You can't be here right now. You'll be roped into the briefing if you stay. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: We've got big problems here today. Maya: Why? What's going on? Gumshoe: It's a virus! A virus!! Phoenix: (A virus?) Gumshoe: There's a virus ripping through the precinct's computer system. Phoenix: (But I really need to ask you some questions...) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Your batteries won't last forever. Remember that when you're having fun... in bed.\" We have a winner! A little joke to make people think about their smoke alarms. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a fire safety campaign... ...I guess? ...Does he even know what he's trying to get across anymore? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut. Chief: Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to read the paper now. Phoenix: (Alternately, you could read some reports... Just a suggestion.) Chief: What the heck is this!? This paper's more than a month old! And someone's written all over it! Who's the clown that put this on my desk? Well? Speak up! Maya: He just wadded it up and chucked it in the trash! Phoenix: But that's an important piece of evidence! Talk Tender Lender Gumshoe: OK, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up! Maya: Y-Yes! Gumshoe: No matter how poor you get, never borrow money from a place like this, you hear? Maya: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: If you got money trouble, just go on a diet of instant noodles and hang in there! Phoenix: Ah, we're not thinking about borrowing money, Detective! We want information. Gumshoe: Oh... Is that all? Well, let's see... Tender Lender is considered to be even fishier than the average illegal loan shark. And it seems it ran into trouble just recently. Those guys have been pretty heavy-handed, calling in all their debts. Maya: Really? Gumshoe: Don't go poking your nose around in their business, pal. You'll really regret it if you upset that lady. Phoenix: Alright, I get the picture. (Hey, wait a minute! What did he just say!? \"That lady\"?) Maya: Who's this lady he's talking about, Nick? Phoenix: (We better find out what the story is with this \"lady\"...) Computer viruses Maya: So what exactly is a computer virus, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I dunno. Maya: What? Gumshoe: Look, I just go with the flow, alright, pal? Phoenix: (And here I thought detectives were supposed to be somewhat knowledgeable...) Gumshoe: What's with that face, pal? You think you know what a virus is? Maya: Well, Nick? Do you? Phoenix: A computer virus? Sure. I mean, only in simple terms, of course. Maya: Really? Wow, you know everything. Professor Nick! Gumshoe: Yeah. I'm gonna call you Dr. Wright from now on! Maya: Hey, that sounds pretty cool! Don't you agree, Dr. Wright? Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling they're making fun of me?) OK, fine. I'm no expert, but I can at least explain the basics to the two of you. What's a virus? (appears after \"Computer viruses\") Phoenix: A virus is a program that gets inside a computer and causes damage. Gumshoe: Damage? You mean it makes the machine go \"boom\" and explode? Phoenix: No. The damage is, um... Well, it's all internal. Maya: So the inside goes \"boom\", right? Phoenix: Imagine all the case data you've got stored on your PCs here in the station... A virus could wipe out all that. That's the kind of damage I'm talking about. Maya: Whoa! That's scary. Phoenix: Yeah. And what's even more scary is that viruses are infectious. Maya: Infectious? Phoenix: Most computers are connected together on a network, right? A virus can move on machine to another over the network. So the virus just keeps spreading faster and faster. Gumshoe: Hmph. Just like a real virus, huh. Maya: But, Nick! Why would anyone want to make a program like that? Gumshoe: Yeah. It takes ages to type in all that data. Why would you wanna destroy it, pal? Phoenix: No. People don't infect their own machines. They send the virus to someone else's. Maya: What!? That's horrible! Gumshoe: Oh, I get it... It's like you sneezing on Godot so he catches a cold. Maya: Right! Then he wouldn't be able to turn up in court because he'd be too sick. You really shouldn't do stuff like that, Nick. It's wrong. Phoenix: Who? What? Where? When and why did the conversation jump to talking about me!? Anyway, that's what a computer virus is. A bad program that causes damage. Gumshoe: And all the different viruses have names, right? I kinda feel like I've heard the name of the virus we caught somewhere before. Phoenix: (The name of the virus, huh? I feel like I've heard of it before, too...) MC Bomber (appears after presenting Sports Paper or MC Bomber) Gumshoe: We already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met. Maya: Who are they? Gumshoe: I dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess. Phoenix: And now the virus has been released, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival! Maya: All this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie! Gumshoe: Apparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market. Phoenix: You mean someone put this virus up for sale? Gumshoe: Yeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal. Phoenix: (In the millions!? A virus can be worth that much!?) MC Bomber updated in the Court Record. MC Bomber (subsequent times) Gumshoe: We already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met. Maya: Who are they? Gumshoe: I dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess. Phoenix: And now the virus has been released, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival! Maya: All this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie! Gumshoe: Apparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market. Phoenix: You mean someone put this virus up for sale? Gumshoe: Yeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal. Phoenix: (In the millions!? A virus can be worth that much!?) The Cadaverinis (appears after presenting Violetta profile) Phoenix: I'm not sure if I really want to get involved in this, but who are the Cadaverinis? Gumshoe: Who are they? A scary bunch of people, that's who! Phoenix: (You're a cop, and you're scared? What's that about?) Gumshoe: Trust me, it doesn't matter if you're kid or a cop, these guys are scary. They've got some serious clout in the criminal underworld. We can't touch them. They've got too much moola. Phoenix: Moola...? As in? Gumshoe: They pretty much control all the cash on the city's black market. Phoenix: The black market, huh? And that includes Tender Lender, I take it? Gumshoe: Sure. No one stands up to Bruto Cadaverini. And I mean, no one! Phoenix: (Interesting...) Maya: So Viola's the granddaughter of some mafia boss then? Gumshoe: Yeah. And everyone know how much Bruto loves his little girl. She means everything to him. Phoenix: So... How did she end up at Tender Lender? Gumshoe: I dunno, pal. But I heard she and the boss of the Tender Lender are pretty tight. Maya: Tight? Gumshoe: That's what it said in a file I read related to Maggey's case. Phoenix: (Sounds like a pretty important clue.) Present Sports Paper or MC Bomber Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, umm... about this... Gumshoe: What!? I'm trying to concentrate on Maggey and this virus right now, so I... Aaaaaaaaaaah!! This is it! This stupid name! I remember now! Phoenix: (I thought so. Here it comes...) Maya: Don't just nod to yourself and keep me in the dark, Nick! What's going on!? Phoenix: It's OK, Maya! You don't have to cry about it! Gumshoe: The name scribbled on that sports paper and written on that CD... That's the name of the virus! \"MC Bomber\"! Maya: WHAT!? Gumshoe: Yeah! The virus that's just infected every computer in the station, pal. It's MC Bomber! Phoenix: Can you give us any more details? Please? Glen Elg profile Gumshoe: This guy was a real programming genius. They called him \"the walking computer\" at the place where he worked. Maya: What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!? Phoenix: (*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!) Gumshoe: Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim. Violetta profile Gumshoe: That's the girl who works over at Tender Lender. You wanna stay away from her, OK? I mean it. Maya: She does look kind of unforgiving, doesn't she? Gumshoe: That should be the least of your worries, pal. Phoenix: (What's that supposed to mean? What could be worse...?) Gumshoe: Her name's Viola Cadaverini. She's the only granddaughter of Bruto Cadaverini. Maya: Bruto Cadaverini? Do you know who that is, Nick? Phoenix: Never heard of him. Gumshoe: Bruto Cadaverini's the boss of the Cadaverini family. Phoenix: The Cadaverinis? (That's one scary-sounding name!) Gumshoe: We can't touch them. They're way too powerful for the police. But you're thinking of taking them on, aren't you? Phoenix: N-No! I don't remember ever saying I was going to! (I better get some more info out of Gumshoe about this \"family\"...) Furio Tigre profile Gumshoe: Oh, this guy... The Tiger... Maya: Is he famous? Gumshoe: Yeah. This guy's not a loan shark, you know. Nope. He's a big loan cat! Phoenix: Hence the name? Gumshoe: Don't pay him back, and you'd better say your prayers, because he'll eat you alive. Maya: You're shaking, Detective. Phoenix: Like a leaf... Gumshoe: I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean. Bruto Cadaverini profile Gumshoe: I wouldn't go flashing that photo around if I were you, pal. Maya: Why not? Gumshoe: That guy rules the criminal underworld. You could get yourselves in serious trouble. I'm talking say-your-prayers trouble. Maya: You're shaking, Detective. Phoenix: Like a leaf... Gumshoe: I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean. After clearing \"MC Bomber\" and \"The Cadaverinis\" Talk options: Gumshoe: Aaaaargh! I can't believe it! I almost forgot the most important thing! Phoenix: A-And that is...? Gumshoe: You know, the lunchbox! How did everything go!? Phoenix: L-Lunchbox? Maya: You remember. The weenies...? Byrde: I hate weenies! Phoenix: (Oh, yeah... Those weenies.) Gumshoe: So? How did my weenies taste when they went down the hatch? Maya: Huh? Um... Well... It was... delicious! Gumshoe: Yeah? That's what she said? Really!? Maya: Umm... Well... Not exactly... Gumshoe: Don't worry about it, pal. I figured something would happen, so I came prepared. Phoenix: Prepared? What do you mean...? Gumshoe: I made a jumbo lunchbox! Maya: Oh... Gumshoe: Do me a favor again, huh, pal, and deliver this? Phoenix: (This sure is a heavy burden... In more ways than one...) Gumshoe: I can just imagine Maggey's little eyes sparkling with joy when you bring her that! Maya: ...Weenies, again, Nick? Tell me we don't have to eat all these too... Gumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya. Again. Maya: I really can't eat any more... Present Gumshoe's Lunchbox Gumshoe: Don't forget to give that to Maggey, OK? Maya: But they don't allow presents for the prisoners in the detention center, right...? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right... ... Well it doesn't matter. I'm counting on you to get it to her somehow. Phoenix: (I'm a lawyer, not a delivery boy, Gumshoe...) Blue Screens, Inc. Talk Glen's troubles (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Basil: Glen's head had more processing power than any computer. But it had been infected with a \"gambling\" virus. Glen was... in too deep. Phoenix: You mean he was in debt? Basil: Yes. 100,000 dollars in debt. Not an easy amount to repay. So... He said he was taking on some extra work. Something a bit risky. Phoenix: \"Risky\"? How? Maya: Maybe he was going to become a waitress at Trés Bien!? Phoenix: (Where do you come up with these ideas!?) Risky extra work (appears after \"Glen's troubles\") Phoenix: So it's safe to say Mr. Elg was the creator of this virus, huh? Basil: The \"MC Bomber\" virus? Yes. It was a work of genius. In a bad sort of way, of course. But still genius. Something like that would probably fetch several million dollars on the black market. Phoenix: (Inconceivable! Gumshoe was right for a change!) This date, December 3rd, that is marked on his calendar... That was his deadline for repaying his debts. MC Bomber updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: (I guess we won't be needing these horse racing tickets any more.) Glen Elg's Losing Horse Racing Tickets thrown back on the floor. Maya: Use the trash can, Nick! Risky extra work (subsequent times) Phoenix: So it's safe to say Mr. Elg was the creator of this virus, huh? Basil: The \"MC Bomber\" virus? Yes. It was a work of genius. In a bad sort of way, of course. But still genius. Something like that would probably fetch several million dollars on the black market. Phoenix: (Inconceivable! Gumshoe was right for a change!) This date, December 3rd, that is marked on his calendar... That was his deadline for repaying his debts. Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Glen's Trouble -- Phoenix: So, how about you tell me what kind of trouble Mr. Elg was in? Basil: I'm sorry, sir, but we don't deal with trouble-shooting here. Perhaps you'd like to speak to someone in customer service? Phoenix: (What's she talking about!? I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...) Ms. Basil. Let me ask you something. Did Mr. Elg's troubles have something to do with this? Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Basil: What is that? Phoenix: A lottery ticket. There were a ton of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime. (Changed from [There were hundreds of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime.] in the original release) Basil: And what is the relevance of that? Phoenix: The victim, Mr. Glen Elg... ...had a gambling habit, didn't he? Basil: I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone dreams of being rich. Even I listen to Millionaire Radio. Phoenix: (She's right. That is a bit weak on its own.) But Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to the lottery, was it? Present Losing Horse Racing Tickets Phoenix: Leads to: \"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: Everyone likes to gamble from time to time. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: But be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc. Phoenix: (Looks like I got that one wrong.) Leads back to: \"I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts.\" Present Losing Horse Racing Tickets Phoenix: Basil: What is that? Phoenix: A bunch of horse racing tickets. All losing ones. Basil: With that many tickets, you could get 1 dollar at the recycling center. You good people are very, very bad. Cashing in on others' misfortunes is immoral. Phoenix: (...Is that a whiff of hypocrisy I smell?) (Changed from [...Why did I get a whiff of hypocrisy just now?] in the original release) Basil: But what is the relevance of these tickets? Phoenix: The victim, Mr. Glen Elg... He had a gambling habit, didn't he? Basil: I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone likes to go to the races from time to time. Phoenix: (Yeah, but not everyone buys this many tickets!) Basil: Anyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own. Phoenix: You're right. But I'm not through yet. Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to horse races, was it? Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: Everyone likes to gamble from time to time. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: But be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc. Phoenix: (Looks like I got that one wrong.) Leads back to: \"Anyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!? Basil: I'm not sure. Let's ask one of the programmers... Excuse me. Can you answer this man's query, please? Programmer: The data queue that manages system tasks for trouble-shooting requires that the multi-tasking simulation for local variables be put into sleep mode so that data transmission on active nodes can be bundled correctly according to the source code. ...Obviously. Basil: So I'm afraid that is the situation, you see. Did you good people follow all that? Phoenix: Not even slightly! What was all that mumbo-jumbo? Basil: It is exactly as my programmer explained. Phoenix: (I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.) Basil: Would you like to input another question? Leads back to: \"I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...\" Phoenix: The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times. That's got to have hurt his wallet pretty bad, don't you think? Maybe bad enough to be the cause of some pretty serious trouble perhaps!? Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Basil: You are right. Glen did have a gambling habit. You good people must not follow his example, do you understand? Phoenix: Trust me. Even if I wanted to, I don't exactly have the money to buy any. Basil: But... if you win, there's no problem, is there? And Glen had a winning ticket, didn't he? For half a million dollars? Phoenix: Yeah, but... Basil: It's hard to imagine how he could have been in trouble then, isn't it? Phoenix: It's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end. But that was his first stroke of good luck. He was in deep trouble before that. Basil: Deep trouble? What do you mean? Phoenix: Mr. Elg's real problem was with someone or something more terrifying and ferocious! Present Glen's Calendar Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Elg met with someone on the day he was killed. He even made a note on this calendar about the meeting: \"Meet with The Tiger.\" Basil: What is the relevance of that? Are you trying to suggest Glen was meeting him to discuss his debt? Phoenix: Y-Yeah. That's what I was thinking. Basil: But I have never heard anything about this \"Tiger\" before. Maybe he's not even human. Maybe he really is a tiger! Phoenix: (I'm no programmer, but does she really expect me to buy such messed up logic?) In that case, I think it's time to introduce you to The Tiger. Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\".\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!? Basil: I'm not sure. Let's ask one of the programmers... Excuse me. Can you answer this man's query, please?

Phoenix: (I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.) Basil: Glen had a lot of friends, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"But I have never heard anything about this \"Tiger\" before.\" Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Phoenix: Furio Tigre... The boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\". Basil: \"Tender Lender\"!? People with businesses should think harder before naming their offices. Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk!) Well? What do you think? Basil: Our firm is doing very well at the moment. I don't think we need to borrow money. Phoenix: No, no, no! I mean about Mr. Elg! Basil: You think Glen had something to do with this Furio Tigre? Phoenix: Yes... Basil: I'm sorry. I don't know of any connection between the two of them. Phoenix: (Really? Because I've got proof that Mr. Elg and The Tiger knew each other.) Present Glen's Calendar Phoenix: Leads to: \"Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\".\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!?

Leads back to: \"You think Glen had something to do with this Furio Tigre?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: All good people get into trouble sometimes. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: Let's ask one of my programmers what they think... Excuse me? What do you think? Programmer: I'm taking a break. Basil: Yes. Perhaps I should take a break, too. Phoenix: (I wish I could take a break from my troubles, but the rest stop was about a mile back.) Leads back to: \"It's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end.\" Phoenix: Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\". This is who Mr. Elg met with on the day of his murder. And the only thing a loan shark would talk with him about would be his debt! Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Basil: It's true that Glen had racked up quite a bit of debt from his gambling habit. About 100,000 dollars, I think. Phoenix: (100,000 dollars? Ouch!) Basil: But I heard he won the lottery, so he should have been in the clear. Phoenix: (Shame Maggey couldn't get a bit of that good luck.) OK... ...So the guy got lucky and won the lottery. But what if he hadn't won? What was his plan then? Basil: Well... This isn't easy to say, but... He said he would use his talents to repay the money. Phoenix: His \"talents\"? Basil: I suspect he was talking about programming. Phoenix: Wh-What computer program is worth 100,000 dollars!? Basil: ... Perhaps you good people should leave so I can get back to my work. Phoenix: (I'm so close to cracking her!) The program in question... Was it by any chance... this!? Present MC Bomber (after clearing \"MC Bomber\" Talk option in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Well? This is it, isn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: This is a very delicate matter. Without the necessary data, there's really no way I can access the information. Phoenix: (I know Mr. Elg created some sort of program! She can't deny it if I show her the program itself as evidence!) Leads back to: \"I'm so close to cracking her!\" Phoenix: Well? This is it, isn't it? This is the virus that's infecting computers world-wide as we speak... \"MC Bomber\"! Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Tender Lender Talk The head bandage (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Viola: Four months ago... I was in a traffic accident... That's why I needed the operation... When I woke up... they told me it was nothing serious... A simple procedure... Maya: Oh! Really? Phoenix: (Well, I guess if she recovered in 4 months, it couldn't have been too big...) Viola: They said the operation... cost one million dollars... Maya: A... A... A million bucks!? Viola: My grandfather ordered Don Tigre to pay... One million dollars... In \"compensation\"... Maya: \"Compensation\", huh...? Phoenix: It's underworld lingo for paying money to settle a score. Basically, pay or get into some serious trouble! (But a million bucks!? This has to be related to our poisoning case somehow...) Compensation (appears after \"The head bandage\") Leads to: \"I wanted to believe him... I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said...\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Head Bandage -- Phoenix: You said that bandage around your head was from an operation? Viola: ... Phoenix: You also said you suffered a \"fatal injury\" to the head, correct? Viola: Yes... The operation was very... difficult, apparently... Phoenix: Now, by \"fatal injury\", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right? Viola: ... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: Did the injury in question have something to do with this? Present Repair Bill Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have here a car repair bill.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Viola: Donuts...? Phoenix: Huh? Viola: I baked them myself... Home-made donuts... Have one... Phoenix: Umm, what's inside? Viola: Jam, and... ... Phoenix: I'm sorry, but I didn't quite catch that... Viola: Hee... Hee... Phoenix: Um... Thanks, but no thanks... I think I'll pass. (I guess that was a flop. What happened to this woman for her to have such a huge bandage around her head? There must be some piece of evidence that'll prompt her to tell me what happened...) Leads back to: \"Now, by \"fatal injury\", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right?\" Phoenix: I have here a car repair bill. From this, it seems pretty obvious that this car was involved in an accident. Viola: Let me see that... ... This bill is made out to the \"Cadaverinis\"...? Phoenix: Y-Yes, it is. Viola: I don't think... I ever introduced myself... Tell me... what do the \"Cadaverinis\"... have to do with me...? Phoenix: (Something tells me she's not about to say hi and introduce herself... Alright, then...) Your relationship with the Cadaverinis is very strong... And this is why. Present Viola Cadaverini or Bruto Cadaverini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I know exactly who you are, Viola Cadaverini!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: So!?

Viola: ... 1 LOCK BROKEN Viola: It happened about 4 months ago... I was driving in one of our family's cars... when someone pulled out in front of me... It was a motorbike... or something like that... I don't remember it much... Anyway, I swerved to try to avoid it, but... ...I took a blow... to the head... A bad one. Phoenix: (Yeah, I can imagine...) So what happened to the person on the bike? I'm guessing they didn't get away with injuring THE Viola Cadaverini, right? Viola: I... don't know... what happened to them... They ran away... Or so I heard... Phoenix: Ran away? Viola: If they'd stayed, I'd have... Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: (Hmm, is it possible...?

(The person who caused the accident was riding a motorbike... Who could it be?) Leads back to: \"Hmm, is it possible...? Could the person who committed the hit and run have been...?\" Phoenix: It was this man, wasn't it? He was the cause of your accident. Viola: ... It wasn't Don Tigre! I refuse to believe it! 1 LOCK BROKEN Viola: We collided... The motorbike, and my car... But Don Tigre isn't injured at all... is he? Phoenix: (It was The Tiger who caused Viola to crash. I can feel it! Plus, one of her locks just broke, so she must suspect it was him, too...) I'm sorry, Ms. Cadaverini... But I have proof that The Tiger was involved in a traffic accident on his bike! Present Scooter Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's not exactly a motorbike, but...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: And this is my proof! Viola: Hard-boiled eggs...? Please, try one...

Leads back to: \"It was The Tiger who caused Viola to crash. I can feel it!\" Phoenix: It's not exactly a motorbike, but... ...Mr. Tigre rides around in a scooter, doesn't he? And you'll notice that the front wheel guard is badly damaged. Viola: ... Phoenix: Ms. Cadaverini... You know the truth, don't you? Viola: ... Hee... Hee... Hee... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: This repair bill was paid by Furio Tigre. The Cadaverinis have known for ages who caused the accident, haven't they? Viola: ... It's possible... Perhaps... Somewhere inside me... I know that may be true... Phoenix: (I knew it...) Viola: But... Don Tigre still saved my life... The operation was very complicated... It was very, very expensive... Phoenix: How much are we talking? Viola: ... Very, very, very expensive... Phoenix: (She seems kind of hesitant about giving me an actual figure. I should back off...) Well, anyway, it was The Tiger who paid for it, right? Viola: After I recovered... Don Tigre told me... He said he paid for the operation because... he cared about me... I... believe him... Phoenix: Really? But do you honestly believe that to be true? Viola: ... Phoenix: Do you want to know what I think...?

Roasty-toasty, that's me! Viola: Don Tigre told me, you see... Leads back to: \"He said he paid for the operation because... he cared about me...\" Phoenix: Perhaps I shouldn't be saying this, but... ...your grandfather, Bruto Cadaverini, controls a lot of \"dubious\" cash, right? And you are his beloved pride and joy. Viola: ...

Only a whole lot more real... And a whole lot scarier, too.) Viola: I wanted to believe him... I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said... He said it had nothing to do with my grandfather being Bruto Cadaverini... I wanted to believe he helped me because he cared about me. Not about my grandfather... But I knew... That wasn't really true... Maya: Wow. I'm so sorry. Viola: What he did to get the money was... It was... evil! Phoenix: ...! Viola: He said it was all for me... So I... I helped him... Maya: You helped him? In what way? Viola: Here... Take these... Phoenix: (What are these? Medical papers?) Viola: I'm Bruto Cadaverini's granddaughter... He had to pay compensation... He was made an offer... He simply... couldn't... refuse. Viola's Medical Papers added to the Court Record. Maya: Wow, I feel so bad for Viola. Phoenix: It's inexcusable! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: (There are two things that I consider inexcusable. Poisoning, and betrayal! Only a coward would hurt people using either of these tactics.) Maya: Is everything alright, Nick?

Tigre: Yeah. You' don't wanna cross them, or youse gonna wind up sleepin' with de fishes. Once the Godfather finds out youse been draggin' Violetta through the mud... ...he'll... do you... in... Phoenix: ... Sorry, I... I couldn't quite put it all together towards the end there... Maya: He said that just like Viola, didn't he? Phoenix: (I get the feeling this might not be the right time to probe him about her...) Press harder Phoenix: Mr. Tigre! Tigre: Whad'youse want!? Phoenix: Err... If you wouldn't mind going into a bit more detail... Godot: Godot: This is a dead end, Trite, and you know it. Remember the rules! Judge: Pressing the witness without evidence to back up your attack is prohibited. As I said earlier, the court will impose a penalty for such behavior! Phoenix: (Ouch. The pain...) Leads to: \"Now then, Mr. Tigre...\" Leave it Phoenix: (It's too dangerous to press things without knowing where they might end up. I'd better just focus on gathering information at the moment...) Leads to: \"Now then, Mr. Tigre...\" Judge: Now then, Mr. Tigre... Would you mind repeating your testimony from the beginning, please? Tigre: My time ain't free, you' hear? Youse betta remember dat! If I miss that bus, someone's gonna pay! Phoenix: Nngh...Maya: Just think! All you have to do is press him on something irrelevant, and bam! $50,000!Phoenix: Get real, Maya! How about you pay back the money then. Your allowance should cover it!Maya: Hey! I'm no idiot, you know!Phoenix: (Well, I'M certainly not the one who thought the $50,000 was free money!) Anyway, I need to work this guy without pressing his testimony too hard.Maya: But his testimony is pretty solid as it is...Phoenix: (I admit nothing jumps out at me as a contradiction. But I've got to find an opening somewhere... Or I need to make one.)Phoenix: Mr. Tigre... You claim you didn't know Mr. Glen Elg. But it appears that Mr. Elg knew you.Tigre: What!?Phoenix: Mr. Elg left this little note on his calendar. \"Meet with The Tiger\"... And the date? December 3rd. (Changed from ['Meet with The Tiger'... Dated, December 3rd.] in the original release)Judge: D-December 3rd!? That's... the day of the murder!Phoenix: So, Mr. Tigre, I submit that you did indeed know one Mr. Glen Elg! Because on the very day of the incident, you met with him!Tigre: ... Grrrah ha ha ha hah! Not bad! Youse actually not bad.Phoenix: S-Sorry?Tigre: I was just messin' with youse to see how good you' were.Maya: Did you hear that, Nick? He said you're not bad!Phoenix: (That's one compliment I can do without! Plus, he's lying through his teeth!)Judge: Um, witness. Please remember that you're under oath. Lies will not be tolerated.Tigre: Youse callin' me a liar!? Is that what you' doin'!?Judge: Ruh-roh!Godot: So you're saying that your claim to have \"never seen that kid before\" is the truth?Tigre: I said I'm dead serious! Youse betta believe that's the truth!Godot: Ha...! Then I'd say that gives me time... to enjoy another cup of pure black magic! That is, while you testify for the court again, Mr. Tigre.Judge: Oh, yes! Um, would you mind indulging the court, witness?Phoenix: (He never actually met the victim!? That's got to be a lie right there! It's time I nailed this guy!)Witness Testimony-- The Victim, Glen Elg --Tigre: I ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg. There was some lame guy with that name, though. Wanted to borrow cash from me. I set up a meetin' with the guy... at my office, Tender Lender. I waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed. I ain't never been to that Trés Bien joint, youse hear?Judge: I see... That all seems perfectly logical. You had arranged to meet with the victim, but he didn't show up.Godot: I've heard it's pretty hard to keep appointments when you're dead.Judge: Very well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor!Tigre: Didn't I tell you I got a big deal goin' down today? I ain't gonna make my bus now. I'm gonna have to take the express train. That bill's goin' straight to you... Wright!Phoenix: Grr...Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Victim, Glen Elg --Tigre: I ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And yet, your name was written on the victim's calendar! Tigre: Get that horse calendar outta my face! I'm The Tiger, not a lame horse, you' porcupine! Tigers like me eat horses like that for breakfast! Judge: No, no, no! Witnesses aren't permitted to eat evidence. Not that they ever would! ... Well, there's was [sic] a case once, where a young lad ate-- Phoenix: A-Anyway! If you had never met the victim before, how do explain this note he left?Tigre: There was some lame guy with that name, though. Wanted to borrow cash from me.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That's very strange. According to the manager of the firm where the victim worked... ...December 3rd was the date he had to repay his loan. He wasn't due to discuss borrowing money, but repaying what he owed... Tigre: Oh. Yeah. Maybe youse right. Whatever it was, it was goin' down at the beginnin' of December. Phoenix: So you did meet Mr. Elg, then!? Tigre: Hey, Wright. Youse might wanna cool your jets a sec.Tigre: I set up a meetin' with the guy... at my office, Tender Lender.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So your meeting wasn't supposed to be at Trés Bien, then? Tigre: Why would I wanna go to a dump like dat? If I wanna talk with my clients, I got an office decked out for the job. I got the best punching bag youse ever saw in there. Phoenix: (Not exactly a professional office you've got there, you know...) So you were in your office on the day in question?Tigre: I waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He didn't show up? Godot: Ha...! What do you think, Trite? Let's see. How does a dead man get from a French restaurant to a loan shark's office? Phoenix: And you yourself didn't go to Trés Bien? Tigre: What are you' tryin' to pin on me here? Phoenix: Um... Tigre: Why don't youse come down to my office? We can chat about this thing my way, yeah? I got the best punching bag youse ever saw in there. Phoenix: No, no! No need! I'm good, thanks! Tigre: Listen up! I ain't got nothin' more to say, except this.Tigre: I ain't never been to that Trés Bien joint, youse hear?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Never? Not even once? Tigre: Not even once. I was in my office the day that went down. I didn't put poison in no kid's coffee. Capice? Judge: Hmm...Present Trés Bien Matches Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Tigre. Is there something you'd like to tell the court about these matches?\"Maya: Do you think he really didn't meet Glen Elg?Phoenix: Not likely. Because I'm convinced this guy's behind the whole thing.Maya: So you mean... that whole testimony he just gave was a lie?Phoenix: Of course. So we can't afford to give him time to think of ways to plug the leaks in it. I've got to nail him while I still can!\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. I-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me! Judge: The evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee. No! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me? Payne: Well... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!? Judge: This court finds the defendant... Guilty Judge: The court is adjourned. January 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Ahh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world! Phoenix: I bet it does, Maya. Maya: So! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think? Phoenix: Sure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake. Maya: Never! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game. ???: HEY, PAL! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... Maya: Happy New Year, Detective! Gumshoe: Uh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA... Maya: Here's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation! Gumshoe: Um... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO... Maya: Have you got a holiday present for me, Detective? Gumshoe: A what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but... Maya: Yay! Thanks! Gumshoe: LOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT! Maya: Hey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you? Gumshoe: Ah... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose? Maya: Ha ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year? Gumshoe: Very funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this! Phoenix: What is it? A magazine? Maya: Hey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\" Phoenix: Tr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!? Gumshoe: It's a report, pal. About you! Maya: Listen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\" Gumshoe: WELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it! Phoenix: But I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway? Gumshoe: Umm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month. Maya: Which makes it old news, you mean. Phoenix: But I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December! Maya: Hmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick? Gumshoe: If it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility... Maya: No way. You don't mean... Phoenix: A pho... Maya: A phony Nick!? Phoenix: (This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...) Magazine Clipping added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: SO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!? Phoenix: What do you mean, what am I going to do about it? Maya: Well, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case! Phoenix: My fault!? How do you figure that? Maya: Because THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of... Gumshoe: Yeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves? Phoenix: (But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...) Gumshoe: You better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it? Maya: Sounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto! Phoenix: I don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned. Maya: ... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year. Gumshoe: So you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!? Phoenix: (I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least pretend to read them once in a while. Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's sort of a keepsake... something to remember Mia by. Sure, the office is a mess, but I never forget to water this little fella. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so it's still super neat and tidy from when Pearls cleaned it. Movie poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I have to check it out one of these days. Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they bought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called \"Gatewater Land\". ...I wonder if that bellboy is going to send me a greeting card this year, too? Talk What to do Maya: So, what's our first move? Phoenix: I guess we go down to the detention center and talk-- Maya: Wait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right? Phoenix: Hey, hey! Let's get one thing straight. It wasn't me, it was a fake me that did this! Maya: Hmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean. Phoenix: (I hope not. *shudder* ...And what kind of name for an evil double is Xin Eohp anyway!?) Maya: Ah! Nick! I've got it! Phoenix: If you're going to ask whether I've got a twin brother, the answer is no. Maya: ...Spoilsport. Any ideas Maya: Did you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me? Phoenix: What do you mean? Maya: I mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess he was acting kind of strange. Maya: Maybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick! Phoenix: ... Considering how we interact, I seriously doubt that, Maya... Maya: Well, if he wasn't nervous because of you... Phoenix: ...then maybe it's because of our new guilty client? Present Attorney's Badge Maya: So you've still got that badge, I see. Phoenix: Huh!? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I? Maya: Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job. Phoenix: (...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.) Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe you've got an impersonator. Phoenix: I can't either. *sigh* Maya: Aww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people impersonating them! Phoenix: This isn't funny, Maya. It's not just an impersonation. This guy stole my identity! And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result. Maya: ...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick? Phoenix: (...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day. Phoenix: ...That's called \"taking a shower\". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it's because Maya's at a loss these days...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia helped me out in court again last time. Maya: It's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that. Phoenix: Yeah... Maya: We mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis... Phoenix: ...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don't we just have Pearls call her? Maya: No... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her. Phoenix: (I guess Maya's got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.) Godot profile Maya: So you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh? Phoenix: I already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much. Maya: Well he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter. Phoenix: You're just making that up, Maya! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: Digging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it? Phoenix: No. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him. Maya: Yeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears! Phoenix: (Did you mean he \"gets paid dirt\" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?) Any other evidence Phoenix: Do you know anything about this, Maya? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) Any other profile Phoenix: Do you know anything about this person? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everyone, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this individual. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: It's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick? Phoenix: Looks like Gumshoe isn't around. Maya: He's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work! Phoenix: No, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case. Maya: Guess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh? Phoenix: After being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Don't die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!\" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that's the key. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Desks Phoenix: These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks. Poster Phoenix: A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT! Mask☆DeMasque turned up at the bank? What's he doing!? \"Hands up, you scalawags!\" \"You're under arrest!\" Hey! That's our job! Phoenix: (Looks like Ron DeLite's opted for a new career.) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\", right Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Umm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: This is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...? Phoenix: K-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me! ???: Aaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying. Phoenix: A-Aren't... you... ???: Yes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down! Maya: Aah! You're... Are you...? ??? Don't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Maggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt-- Byrde: Oh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!? Maya: You better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick. Byrde: O-Oh... I see... Phoenix: So that's where we stand right now. Maya: I'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder... Byrde: My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures. Phoenix: (I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...) Byrde: But I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir! Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. I bet they don't get too many waitresses in here. He looks like he's getting a bit restless. Talk Maggey Byrde Maya: So, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform. Byrde: Hmph. I was fired after that... incident last year. Maya: Oh. I'm sorry. Byrde: It's OK. I don't mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on. Maya: So, what do you do now? Byrde: In the second act of \"The Life of Maggey Byrde\", I'm playing the role of a waitress! Maya: A waitress!? Byrde: Yes. In a French restaurant. It's a small place, but it's quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir. Phoenix: And then you got into this mess straight away, right? Byrde: Yeah, you could put it that way... What happened Byrde: This whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Trés Bien. Maya: \"Treh Bee-an\"...? Byrde: Yes. It's a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included! Maya: Oh... Byrde: There were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim's cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out. Maya: Hey, hold on there, Maggey. Byrde: What? Maya: You keep calling the guy, \"the victim\". Didn't you know the guy who was killed? Byrde: Not at all! I'd never even seen the guy before! Maya: Oh... Phoenix: (So she wouldn't have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right? Byrde: Of course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele. Phoenix: So, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come? Byrde: ......... You tell me, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ack! (Guess the answer to my question is \"my phony\"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.) Guilty verdict (appears after \"What happened\") Maya: So, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted? Byrde: Because no one else saw. Maya: Saw what? Byrde: The other man. The one who put the poison in the victim's coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. \"The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time.\" Phoenix: But how's that possible? Byrde: I don't know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could've done a better job! Phoenix: Look! That wasn't me, OK? Byrde: And then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket. Maya: What? Byrde: A small bottle... of poison. Maya: WHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!? Byrde: Well, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must've slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious. Phoenix: And no one else saw this other guy? Byrde: No, sir. That's what everyone said. But I don't see how they could've missed him... The other guy (appears after \"Guilty verdict\") Byrde: I was the one who took the coffee to the two men. Phoenix: O-Oh...? And what was your impression of them? Byrde: Well... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry. Maya: In music? How come? Byrde: Well, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician's look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Maya: An earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all? Byrde: It had a band's name written on it. I think it was \"MC\"-something. They must've been preparing for their debut, I guess. Phoenix: So it was a band's CD. Maybe a promo disc? Maya: Maybe it was \"MC Screwdriver\"! Phoenix: Get serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that? Byrde: Nngh... What was the name of that group again...? \"MC Hacksaw...\"? No... \"MC...\" Maya: And what about the killer? What did he look like? Byrde: Well, I, um... I don't really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really. Present Attorney's Badge Byrde: That badge! Is it real? Phoenix: Of course it's real! Byrde: That's what they all say. But I've been duped before. Give it to me for a sec! Phoenix: Ah...! ...*chomp!* Maya: She... She bit into it... Byrde: And I left a few teeth marks, too! Phoenix: I can see that... Byrde: I just wish I could remember if that means it's real or a fake. Phoenix: *sigh* (I said it was real!) Magazine Clipping Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I need to ask you about this... Byrde: Hey! This article's about my case! Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me? Byrde: Yes, sir! It was the morning after I'd been arrested... I met you in the visitor's room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits. Phoenix: Me? Byrde: Yes, you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Argh... Maya: Hey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too? Byrde: No. I don't remember a phony you, Maya. Maya: Oh... *sigh* It would've been so cool... Byrde: Then you got really worked up and passionate. \"I'm gonna get you' cleared'a dis crime!\" you said. (Changed from ['I'm gonna get you cleared of this crime!' you said.] in the original release) Phoenix: OK, I get the picture. But you've met me in person before... So how come you didn't realize that guy wasn't the real me? Byrde: ... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange... Phoenix: Only a little? Byrde: Well, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And... Phoenix: So the guy was nothing like me, then!? Byrde: But he had your spiky hair and blue suit. Phoenix: (... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?) Maya: How about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter? Byrde: Everyone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir. Maya: This case just keeps getting weirder and weirder... Maya Fey profile Byrde: Thanks for your help last year! Maya: Aw, it was nothing. I'm glad we got you off the hook. Byrde: I hope you can help me out this year, too! Maya: Yeah, me too. It's be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned. Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Oh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force! Phoenix: Have you seen him recently? Byrde: No. He's never been to the restaurant. Maya: Guess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all. Byrde: Yeah, he prefers the simple things in life. Phoenix: (...Or he's just simply too poor to afford anything else.) Maggey Byrde profile Byrde: No matter what happens, I never let anything get me down! Maya: You're always so positive, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! The early Byrde catches the worm! A Byrde in the hand! Maya: Wow! All those phrases are named after you? Byrde: And I never turn my back on anything! Maya: You're always so strong, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! I'm a tough old Byrde! Maya: \"Tough old byrde\", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it? Phoenix: ...Yeah, I get it. Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be on the police force, sir. But I'm incarcerated, now. So I can't use my connections to help you. All I can tell you about now is info about ex-cons or the clientele of Trés Bien, sir... Maya: Aww, don't let it get you down, Maggey! After clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping: Byrde: Mr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial? Phoenix: Probably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial. Byrde: Um... Mr. Wright...? Phoenix: ? Byrde: Do you think we'll win next time? ...Sir? Phoenix: ...! Byrde: My life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck! Maya: Argh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this! Phoenix: Wh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!) Maya: We'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you! Byrde: Thank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then! Phoenix: Trés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place. Byrde: Yes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi! Maya: Sure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food! January 6Trés Bien Maya: Wow! Look at this place. Phoenix: \"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right? Maya: Actually, I'm not all that into it... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here. Phoenix: Don't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here! Maya: Perfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want! Phoenix: (Yeah, I suppose we can...) Examine Cash register Maya: Look, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money. Phoenix: You know, you're the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way! Trinkets Maya: Look at all the little trinkets tucked away in here. Phoenix: I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let's see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups! Maya: ... I never knew you were so... cultured. Phoenix: Come on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much! Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? It'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then. Phoenix: Hm? There's something stuffed in behind the rack. Maya: ...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. \"MC Bomber\", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe? Phoenix: I wonder what \"MC Bomber\" is supposed to be...? ! (This paper! It's from December 3rd...) This paper's from the day of the poisoning! Maya: WHAT!? Sports Paper added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...) Magazine rack (subsequent times) Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Looks like Mr. Armstrong doesn't get any newspapers. Maya: Well, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it? Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" like in these mags, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Phoenix: (We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I'd better try to find out everything I can about it...) Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: What do you think this flower is, Nick? Phoenix: Let's see... Well, it doesn't look like a tulip, and it's not a sunflower, I don't think... Maya: Duh. Even I could've told you that. Phoenix: Well, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I'm a lawyer, not a botanist! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got you! I was only kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Crime scene Phoenix: This must be the table where the murder occurred. Maya: I guess so, with all this police tape all around it. Phoenix: And that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don't go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya? Maya: Why would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know! Phoenix: (Then why can I picture you doing just that?) Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Sports Paper Maya: Hmm... \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: There's something about that name, \"MC Bomber\". Phoenix: Yeah, It's a pretty unusual name. Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: Everyone's worried about bombs these days, I guess. Phoenix: I'm not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...) Maya: Anyway, we should really look into this some more! Maggey Byrde profile Maya: This is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then. Maya: Wasn't she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We're gonna get her off the hook or I'll give up hamburgers! Detention Center Present Sports Paper Byrde: Oh! A sports paper. Let's see, let's see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title? Phoenix: Sorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It's from the day of the murder... Maya: And Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid. Byrde: Oh, no... Phoenix: I found this paper in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Byrde: Really? That's strange... Trés Bien doesn't get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he's not really fond of them. Maya: Then maybe one of the customers left it behind? Phoenix: Anyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here. Byrde: Ah-ha! That's it, sir! \"MC Bomber\"! That was the name that was written on the CD! Phoenix: (Just as I thought...) Maya: I guess it wasn't \"MC Screwdriver\" after all, huh... Byrde: So, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right? Maya: If someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! \"The Master of Kurain\" or \"The Spirit Song\" or even \"Maya's Theme\"! Phoenix: Um, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim's table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim! Maya: You're right! Phoenix: (So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...) Maya: I think we better step up the investigation, don't you Nick? After presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 6Trés Bien ???: Oh là là! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Trés Bien! Maya: Oh! Hel... lo... ... Phoenix: (What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...) ???: Bienvenue! Welcome to my petite restauranté! Maya: Huh? \"Bee Avenue\"? ???: Oh, non, my petite chulip! Maya: Huh? Me? ???: Look at z'is face! Like la kitten rejected by its own mother. You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil mélange of la néroli and la rose. My personal recommendation! Maya: You think I need what...? ???: Oui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voilá! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique! Maya: Really? ???: And for la monsieur! Phoenix: Who? Me? ???: Look at z'at face! Like la puppy rejected by life itself! You are fatigued, non? For you, monsieur, I recommend z'is! Oil of bergamot. And maybe a 'int of... Oui, oui! I will add la peppermint and la clary sage for a fragrance exceptionnel! Such an invigorating recipe will bring out your delicious beauty, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My beauty!? ???: Alors. If you will be seated, I will bring you la special menu of z'e day! Phoenix: Actually, we're not here to eat. We're lawyers. ???: Mais bien sûr! I know z'is already, monsieur. You are la Phoenix Wright, non? Phoenix: Um, yes... You know me? ???: Mais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court! Maya: I guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp... Phoenix: It looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already. Maya: I wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you? Armstrong: Allow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté! Talk Trés Bien Maya: So what does \"Trés Bien\" mean? I know \"trés\". That means \"three\", right? Armstrong: Non, non, non! \"Trés Bien\" is Français! In English, you would say, \"Very Good\". Maya: Oh. Very good... Armstrong: Oui, exactement! La atmosphere is trés bien, and la cuisine is trés bien! Phoenix: (If the food's good, why aren't there any customers in here?) Armstrong: My cuisine is not for all. Some people, z'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine. Phoenix: (I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...) Armstrong: Since I 'ave lost Maggey, I do not 'ave enough 'ands. Phoenix: So, you're running this place on your own now? Armstrong: Oui. For la moment. No one 'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi! Phoenix: (... Please don't eyeball me while you say that.) Armstrong: I am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist. Maya: A roaming what? Armstrong: A practitioner d'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z'e delicate floral aromas. Phoenix: (Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...) What happened Phoenix: So, could you tell me what you know about the incident? Armstrong: Bien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z'an a month 'as passed since it 'appened. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess it's been about a month since Maggey's sentencing...) Armstrong: So. It was z'e third of last month. Just after one in z'e afternoon. A man who was in 'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill. Phoenix: Because of the poison in his coffee? Armstrong: Z'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took 'is drink to 'im. I was in la kitchen. I 'eard z'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, 'e was already slumped in 'is chair. Maya: He was dead? Armstrong: Mon dieu! Oui! 'E was dead! Maggey 'ad passed out also. Phoenix: And this man who died... Was he alone? Armstrong: Oui, monsieur. All alone. I know z'at Maggey said z'ere was someone else, but... Maya: I see... Armstrong: La police, z'ey asked me many times. \"Are you sure z'ere was no one else at z'e table?\" z'ey asked. But I am not z'e only one. La old man said z'e same thing. Phoenix: Old man? What old man? Old man (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Um... So who is the old man that you mentioned? Armstrong: At z'e time of la murder, z'ere was another customer in 'ere. Maya: What!? Someone else saw it? Armstrong: Mais, oui! As usual, 'e came alone z'at day. At z'e time of la murder, 'e was 'ere. 'E saw it, too. But 'e said z'e same thing, z'at z'ere was no one else at la victim's table. Maya: But Maggey swears there were two people! Armstrong: Mais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, 'e could not prove z'is, non? Phoenix: About the lawyer. That was me, I suppose? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr! Phoenix: ... Wow! He's the first person who's said it wasn't me. Maya: Don't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!? Maggey's motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile) Phoenix: When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen? Armstrong: Ou... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so. Phoenix: So what happened? Armstrong: Non. It was, er... It was nothing. Maya: Look, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive! Armstrong: Oui. It is true. Phoenix: If there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant. Maya: So please! Tell us anything you know. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock!?] in the original release) Maya: No way! What are we going to do, Nick? Phoenix: We'll just have to remov... WHAT THE!? Maya: Wh-What's wrong? Phoenix: The Magatama... It's gone! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: I had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air! Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (But I could see the Psyche-Locks. (Changed from [But I could see the Psyche-Lock.] in the original release) Maybe that means the Magatama's nearby...?) Maggey's motive (subsequent times) Phoenix: Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim. 3 PSYCHE LOCKS Armstrong: N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qué será, será. Perhaps Maggey 'ad another reason. Phoenix: (What's Maggey's motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock [sic] must mean it's nearby.) Maya: I only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK? Phoenix: (...And here I thought it was mine to keep!) Present Attorney's Badge Armstrong: Please, monsieur. Z'ere is no need to show me z'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z'e worst defense lawyer in town. Phoenix: (I think I can imagine how he formed this completely wrong impression of me...) Um, the last time we met, did I show you this badge? Armstrong: Oui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant! Maya: Looks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick! Magazine Clipping Armstrong: I am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z'at day was a little, how you say, \"lacking\", per'aps? Phoenix: *sigh* Armstrong: Even a Frenchman who cannot speak any English could 'ave done a better job! You were very cool, though. Oh, oui, oui! So 'andsome. Maya: Wow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been... Armstrong: Every time you opened your mouth, z'e 'ole courthouse stirred. Phoenix: (Oh, man. That is something I don't want to imagine...) Sports Paper Phoenix: We found this sports paper in the magazine rack here. Armstrong: One of my customers must 'ave left it behind. Maya: Do you have any idea which customer it was? Armstrong: Z'e only ideas I 'ave, mademoiselle, I save for my kitchen! Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: If you want a job 'ere, it is yours, precious! Mia Fey profile Armstrong: Mon dieu! What beauty! Maya: That's my sister! Armstrong: Ah, oui? Another delight! But you 'ave a certain je ne sais quois z'at I do not sense from your sister. Maya: I do? Armstrong: So throw your head 'ead 'igh! Thrust out your feminine features! Do not lose 'eart, ma fille! You are a woman! A woman extraordinaire! Maya: Do I look like I need cheering up or something? Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Maggey was a policewoman once, n'est-ce pas? Phoenix: Yes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control. Armstrong: Oui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non? Maya: Oh... You know about that? Armstrong: Z'at is why I gave to 'er la perfume for la 'appiness. Phoenix: Happiness perfume? Armstrong: Oui. Blended from bergamot, like I 'ave given to you before. Phoenix: But she's been arrested again. And found guilty this time. Armstrong: Z'is is true. 'Er natural aroma of un'appiness must 'ave been very strong. Phoenix: (Just admit it! Your perfume doesn't work!) Armstrong: I am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z'at took place before my very eyes. Maya: Something like what? Phoenix: (What's this guy talking about!?) Maya: Does this mean... Maggey did have a motive? Phoenix: We've got to ask this guy for more info, stat! Jean Armstrong profile Armstrong: It is 'ard to imagine, I know, but I was an apprentice for five years in la gay Paris. Maya: Wow! In Paris!? Armstrong: It was something la chef z'ere said to me z'at made me decide to open my own restaurant. Phoenix: What was it? Armstrong: Z'at awful man said to me, \"You must train for another ten years!\" Oh! It was such a shock! So unexpected! But you would 'ave to be a fool to do z'is, non? Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Armstrong: Félicitations! Mais... qu'est-ce que c'est? Phoenix: Ack! Um... Je... Je no comprehend... Maya: Nick! Don't just make something up! After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there? Armstrong: ... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves. Maya: Huh? \"'Im\"? Armstrong: La old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc. Phoenix: La p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that? Armstrong: Behind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\". Maya: Thank you! Armstrong: Je vous en prie, my dear! Maya: Let's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick! January 6Vitamin Square Maya: So this is Vitamin Square. Phoenix: Yeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you. Maya: Hey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about? Phoenix: That grouchy-looking grandpa? Maya: He's throwing seeds out for the pigeons. Phoenix: Maya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them! Old Man: ... Phoenix: (Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...) Examine Sandbox Maya: I used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe! Phoenix: Really? You? Maya: Sure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do. Phoenix: Iron filings? Wow... That's too exciting for words. Maya: It was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then! Phoenix: So, did you manage to get all the iron? Maya: No, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them? Phoenix: No. Fruit attractions Maya: This place is so fruity! Phoenix: That's not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They're among my favorites. Maya: Then that apple slide is perfect for you! Phoenix: ... And what is so \"perfect\" about it? Maya: Oh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo! Phoenix: No way! I'd get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that. Maya: Yeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too. Pigeons Maya: Hey, look. Pigeons! Phoenix: Yeah. And heaps of them, too. Maya: Did you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace? Phoenix: That's a dove, not a pigeon. Maya: ... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony? Phoenix: You're over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya. Magazine on orange-themed seat Maya: Ooh, there's a magazine here. Phoenix: It's a magazine full of job listings. Old Man: You disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away! Phoenix: \"Threw away\"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job? Old Man: Kah! That's none of your business! Phoenix: Sorry! I guess I'll take the magazine with me then. Old Man: I don't want anyone else having it! Give it back! Phoenix: (Too bad. Now that you want it so bad, I don't want to give it up!) Job Listings added to the Court Record. Old Man: Hey! That's mine! Closer orange-themed seat (after examining magazine on orange-themed seat) Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: You don't have to tell me twice. Talk What you saw Phoenix: Um... Excuse me. Old Man: ... Phoenix: Would you mind if I had a word with you? Old Man: Yes! Phoenix: I just want to ask you a couple of questions... Old Man: What's the matter with you!? Can't you see I'm busy? So you don't like my seeds, eh, pigeons!? Phoenix: (He's really chucking those seeds at them! That's got to hurt!) Old Man: Go on! Eat this! Phoenix: (*sigh*) Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Maya: Yes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Kah! It's a disgrace, I tell you. An utter disgrace! Maya: A disgrace? Old Man: An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: Revealing!? You mean her uniform? Old Man: The youth of today! They don't have any shame! No shame, I tell you! Not one ounce! Whatever happened to the old bushido values of Japan, like honor and modesty? Maya: What about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing. Old Man: You!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace! Maya: Talk about hitting a girl where it hurts... Trés Bien Phoenix: Do you go to Trés Bien a lot? Old Man: Hmph! That miserable excuse for a restaurant? That garbage they serve in there's not food. Where's the sushi? The tempura? The rice!? Phoenix: Trés Bien is a French restaurant, sir... Old Man: Where do you think we are, boy? In Paris!? I want real food, not those snooty snacks! And what about those shameless girls!? Phoenix: You mean the waitresses? Old Man: You can see all the way up to their... their... Yes! The waitresses! They're practically naked! It's a disgrace, isn't it? Well, isn't it!? Phoenix: Listen, it's not my restaurant. Old Man: Kah! It's a miserable excuse for a restaurant, that place! Miserable! Phoenix: (He certainly knows the place. He must be a regular! But if he hates it so much, why does he keep going?) Trés Bien regular (appears after \"Trés Bien\") Maya: Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir? Old Man: ... Maya: It's just, if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Maya: He must be hiding something, right? Phoenix: If he is, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock... Oh, wait... I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... Maya: Remember, Nick. That Magatama is only on loan. You better find it or else! Phoenix: (If Pearls ever gets wind of this, I'm going to be in a world of pain...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, excuse me, sir. Could I just ask you about this... Old Man: ... Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: Here you go, boy! How does some pigeon feed sound to you!? Phoenix: (This wasn't exactly what I was hoping to get out of this guy...) Detention Center Present Job Listings Maya: Um, Maggey... Byrde: Oh, are you looking for some part-time work, Maya? Why don't you take a job at the restaurant? I bet Mr. Armstrong would hire you. Maya: Really? Me? Byrde: It's pretty cool being a waitress, you know. And in the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets! Maya: What secrets...? Byrde: You can't make it obvious, but just spy on him for a bit. You'll see. It's interesting. Maya: Wow! I can't wait to get my apron on now! Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Oh, so you met the owner, Mr. Armstrong! Phoenix: He's, um... Oh, how can I put this... pretty unique, huh? Byrde: He has a really intense aura. As a chef and as a person. Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Trés Bien Examine Cash register (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's really tight behind the cash register counter. Can Mr. Armstrong even get in there? And if he got in... could he get out again? Trinkets (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: There's a bunch of little trinkets on a shelf by the door. I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Magazine rack (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Ugh. All the clothes in these are absolutely atrocious! ...Some of them have been circled in red. ... I really hope Mr. Armstrong is not thinking of buying those. Table (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong must be a pretty big neat-freak. He already has this table ready to go. Now if only the food in this place was edible... Windows (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It looks pretty cold out there on the streets. Peaceful, though. It's nice that people can take it easy after the holiday rush. Crime scene (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: This must be the table where the poisoning occurred. The stain tells the story well. The whole area is still cordoned off with police tape. I guess it must still be under investigation. Present Job Listings Armstrong: Mademoiselle! Maya: Y-Yes? Armstrong: Are you looking for la job? Maya: What!? N-No, no. I was just... Armstrong: Let me see. Your style is un peu différent, but you 'ave a good face. Maya: ...Different? Armstrong: Félicitations! You 'ave passed! I will 'ire you! Bien! Come wiz me. I will teach you everyz'ing I know! Maya: N-Nick! HEEEEEELP! Phoenix: (I don't know whether to laugh or feel bad for Maya... Maybe I should do both...?) Vitamin Square Examine Sandbox Phoenix: When I think back to when I was young... ...I wonder what I found so great about playing in a sandbox. Maybe I'll come back here in the middle of the night one of these days to relive it. ... On second thought, being arrested by Gumshoe would be too embarrassing to bear. Fruit attractions Phoenix: You don't see many parks like this anymore. What a great place for kids to play. But that old man's the only one here, chucking his seeds at the pigeons. Pigeons Phoenix: The pigeons are so busy pecking at the seeds, they don't notice anything else. Seeing those birds eat with such intense focus... ...reminds me of Maya when she's scarfing down a burger. Closer orange-themed seat Phoenix: This is where I found that job listings magazine before. A guy like me carrying around a magazine like that kind of gives the wrong impression. I guess I better give it back to that old man once this investigation's over. Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Yes, you do. You know, the waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Hmph! If you ask me It's a disgrace! Th-That's what it is! An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: So, you didn't like that kind of thing, then? Old Man: ... Wh-What are you trying to say about me, boy!? Explain yourself! Phoenix: Um, nothing! I'm not saying anything about you... Old Man: I know your kind! You young ones with your spiky hair and your fancy suits! That heads of yours is over-flowing with filthy ideas! Phoenix: (...I know someone who needs to learn some stress management.) Old Man: Get out of here, you young brat! Trés Bien regular Phoenix: So, you are a regular at that restaurant, right, sir? Old Man: ... Phoenix: You're always complaining about the place, so why do you go there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Phoenix: (Something's not right about this guy... But If he's hiding something, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock.) Oh, wait... (I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... I need to find it before I can get anywhere with this old man.) After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Looks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later. Examine Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. There's nothing for him to do right now, so he's catching some vertical z's. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Poor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Trés Bien once things have cooled off. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Well, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!? Phoenix: Um, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation. Gumshoe: Well, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's really fired up about this...) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor... Phoenix: (Oh. ... Him.) Gumshoe: Now, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again... Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Gumshoe: Um... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!? Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Hitting the gas is like hitting the fast-forward button on your life.\" No. That's too obscure. You don't really get the \"you'll die before your time\" idea. I need something more direct. Something a bit more light-hearted. Something like, \"Hitting the gas is your passport to paradise!\" Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT!? Poisoned coffee waitress gets a retrial!? I knew it! I knew there was something funny about the taste of this coffee! OK! Who brought me this coffee today? Hands up! Phoenix: (Yeesh! Have a little faith in your subordinates!) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Phoenix: No matter what, whenever I come here, that mascot's there to greet me. Chief: You got that right. That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Phoenix: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're married. Phoenix: (So should I expect to see Baby Badger next time I'm here...?) Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: So the guilty party was Maggey Byrde, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah... Phoenix: Back when she was on the police force... ...you were her mentor when she was a rookie, right? Gumshoe: Yeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened. Phoenix: (Gumshoe sure is sweating up a storm over nothing... ...Ah, so that's it! Our big ol' Gumshoe has a little ol' crush on Maggey!) Gumshoe: I... I don't like her or anything! I... I was... Aaaargh! Phoenix: (Note to self: Gossip with Maya about this later!) Gumshoe: Look, pal! Don't tell anyone, OK!? You've gotta keep it a secret, got it!? Phoenix: S-Sure... And would you mind not guessing what I'm thinking all the time? Gumshoe: Hey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind. The victim Phoenix: So I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim? Gumshoe: Glen Elg, he was a computer programmer. Phoenix: I see. A programmer... Gumshoe: He was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal. Phoenix: (Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often? Gumshoe: Not according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy. Phoenix: (A programmer... and a first-time customer at that...) (Changed from [A programmer... and a first-time customer...] in the original release) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that? Gumshoe: That's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial. Phoenix: You're kidding! What was her supposed \"motive\"? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK? Phoenix: (What could this motive have been...?) The investigation Gumshoe: This isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself. Phoenix: O-Oh, that's right... Gumshoe: The judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony. Phoenix: Yeah... Doesn't sound very good for us, huh? Gumshoe: Look, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop. Phoenix: (That's not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony? Contradictions (appears after \"The investigation\") Gumshoe: The biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table. Phoenix: Yeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim. Gumshoe: Right. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD... Phoenix: (CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...) Byrde: And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Gumshoe: But our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD. Phoenix: What? Gumshoe: Not on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal. Phoenix: But didn't Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too? Gumshoe: Yeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie. Phoenix: A radio? He didn't have a CD player? Gumshoe: You got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all. Phoenix: (Come to think of it... The owner of Trés Bien didn't mention that CD either. I don't know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong's got something to hide...) The charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile) Phoenix: So what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Trés Bien? Gumshoe: It's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected with the case anyway... Phoenix: Hey, come on, Detective. Didn't you say you'd give me the dirt on anything? Gumshoe: Well, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stuff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK? Phoenix: Um... Don't suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Trés Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.) Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? (I've got to track this creep down!) Magazine Clipping Gumshoe: I wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was. Phoenix: And what did he say? Gumshoe: He started off by saying, \"I'm at a complete loss for words...\" But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour. Phoenix: But... Gumshoe: He said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty! Phoenix: (It looked like I was \"trying to get Maggey found guilty\"...?) Sports Paper Gumshoe: What's that? A sports paper? Phoenix: Yeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Gumshoe: It's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here. Phoenix: And take a look at this. See this writing here? Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... Hey! Phoenix: What is it? Gumshoe: I've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Gumshoe: Hey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble. Phoenix: (Handwriting, huh? It'd be good to know more about that, in any case...) Gumshoe: Thanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue! Sports Paper given to Detective Gumshoe. Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: Hey! So how come she's not with you today? Phoenix: She's working down at the restaurant right now. Gumshoe: Working, huh? Yeah, it's tough being broke. I would know. Phoenix: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: Next time I see her, I'll show her how to make the world's best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It's the only way! Phoenix: (Um... Why is he shaking my hand with such enthusiasm...?) Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Phoenix: What? Mia did? Gumshoe: Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Godot profile Gumshoe: That's the guy who's gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey's retrial tomorrow. Phoenix: O-Oh, really? Gumshoe: He was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal. Phoenix: (Why's that guy so determined to see me fail?) Gumshoe: You sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind. Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything. Phoenix: It's OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right. Gumshoe: ... You know what? You're not such a bad guy after all, pal. Maggey Byrde profile Phoenix: Have you gone to see Maggey? Gumshoe: Of course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words. Phoenix: Oh... Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to. Phoenix: (Did he go for her, or for himself...?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: The chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Phoenix: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day. Phoenix: Under orders? Old Man: Yeah. You know, there's something about the lady... I mean, guy. Phoenix: Huh!? You can't stop thinking about him!? Gumshoe: Not like that, pal! Gimme a break! He's not my type. I mean, I can't stop thinking that he's involved with this case somehow! Phoenix: (Sounds like he knows a little something more about our charming chef.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you make of this...? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant... Phoenix: (You don't have to explain... Really...) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.: January 6Trés Bien Phoenix: The scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...) ???: Ah! Welcome! Bee avenue! Phoenix: (Wow. What a cute voice.) Maya: Oh, it's just you, Nick. Phoenix: M-Maya! Maya: Well? How do I look? Phoenix: ... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium... Maya: Maybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer. Phoenix: (Then who was that woman I just saw?) Maya: Oh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat! Phoenix: ... I am kind of hungry, actually. Talk Waitress Phoenix: So, how do you like your new job, Maya? Maya: I never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people's orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that. Phoenix: Yeah, it's a nice-looking restaurant. It's a shame more people don't come. Maya: Don't forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my \"gimme a tip\" smile! Lunch special Maya: Hey, Nick! Why don't you order something? The chef's preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says. Phoenix: How much is it? Maya: It's the Twin-T set. So it's 20 dollars, of course. Phoenix: The Twin-T set? I believe I'll be taking a pass. It's kind of expensive. Maya: What!? But you can't! Come on, Nick! It's not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register! Phoenix: How about cleaning the toilets? That should keep you busy. Maya: Yeah, right! Maybe later. Present Anything Phoenix: About this... Maya: Sorry, Nick! I'm a waitress now. I've got a pile of work waiting for little ol' me. After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um... About the lunch... Maya: Oh! A fine choice, sir. Phoenix: No. I, um... Maya: KITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT! Phoenix: I don't need any of that! Maya: Just a moment, please, sir. Phoenix: (Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya! Maya: Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set! Phoenix: Whoa! Maya: A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit! Phoenix: Um, thanks...? Maya: Come on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already! Phoenix: (Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp! Maya: Well? Phoenix: Are you hungry, Maya? Maya: I'm starving! Phoenix: Here. It's yours. Maya: Really!? ... Urp! Phoenix: Remember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate! Maya: ... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets! Phoenix: Hey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!) Trés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record. Phoenix: How does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad? Maya: Hey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen? Phoenix: (The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.) Talk Kitchen Phoenix: Hmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? \"In the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!\" Maya: In the kitchen? Mmm. That sounds tasty! Phoenix: Hey, wait up! Maya! Maya: What is it? I'm pretty busy right now. Phoenix: Weren't you going to show me around? Maya: Tsk. There goes my plan to find some cool clue and show it off in your face... Phoenix: (I'd better conduct the search in the kitchen myself!) After clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Trés Bien: January 6Trés BienKitchen Maya: And here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually. Phoenix: ... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure. Maya: Mr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop! Examine Mirror Maya: Now THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty. Phoenix: There's a book on the dresser. \"Claurice Armstrong's Bedtime Literature\". Maya: Not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it? Phoenix: It looks like a collection of poems he's written. Maya: Poems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK? Phoenix: OK, um... Here's one. Ahem! It's called, \"Printemps\". \"Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must.\" Maya: Huh? That's it!? Phoenix: Yup. That's a poem for you. Oil bottles Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: There's one bottle that's different from all the others. Phoenix: Well what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either. Maya: And... *sniff* It doesn't smell. Phoenix: (So what's that liquid inside then, I wonder?) Maya: Hey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he? Small Bottle added to the Court Record. Oil bottles (subsequent times) Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Lace curtains Phoenix: What are these lace curtains for? Maya: I don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those. Phoenix: (How do you respond to something like that!?) Table Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter! Maya: My Magatama! What's it doing there!? Phoenix: (What indeed...) Magatama put into pocket. Table (subsequent times) Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Maya: And look at these knives. They look really sharp! Phoenix: I'd like to see how one of those slices through a cheesecake. Maya: A cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick. Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I just ate for lunch? Maya: Maybe... What you ate is the only French dish I know the name of. After examining oil bottles in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Hey, you're just in time! Phoenix: What is it, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: The lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me. Phoenix: (He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything? Gumshoe: They said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it. Phoenix: (I expected as much...) Gumshoe: The victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment. Sports Paper refiled into the Court Record. Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal? Phoenix: (Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...) Talk Armstrong's secret (appears after presenting Small Bottle) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes... Gumshoe: So, how was it? Phoenix: To put it nicely... it was inedible. Gumshoe: Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so... Phoenix: Yeah... I guess it's probably the food. Gumshoe: The real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt. Phoenix: Really? How much does he owe? Gumshoe: This is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red. Phoenix: H-Half a million? Are we talking dollars? Gumshoe: Yeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble! Phoenix: Sorry. That figure just took me by surprise. Gumshoe: Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch. Jean's Loan Contract added to the Court Record. Armstrong's secret (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes... Gumshoe: So, how was it? Phoenix: To put it nicely... it was inedible. Gumshoe: Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so... Phoenix: Yeah...

That figure just took me by surprise. Gumshoe: Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch. Present Sports Paper Gumshoe: So according to the boys down at the lab, the doodles were probably made by the victim. Phoenix: Probably? Gumshoe: Analyzing this kind of writing is difficult since it's done with a fiber-tipped pen. But don't worry! I'll vouch for it. Phoenix: (Why would Gumshoe have to vouch for it? Can't it stand on its own?) Small Bottle Gumshoe: You got one of those aroma bottles too, huh? Phoenix: Only this one doesn't smell. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get you... Phoenix: This was mixed in with all the other aromatherapy bottles, but it's not the same. It doesn't even look the same, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: A cologne bottle that doesn't smell, huh? Smells like a skunk to me, pal! Mind letting me borrow that bottle for a while? I wanna send it to the lab for analysis. Phoenix: (The victim was poisoned, so the contents of this bottle are pretty important...) Small Bottle given to Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: I had a lunch there was something funny about that chef. Phoenix: You suspect Jean Armstrong? Gumshoe: I've got that guy's number. I know what his secret is. Phoenix: (That must be the same secret Gumshoe was talking about before.) Gumshoe: I guess I'd better fill you in on the details. About this Armstrong guy's secret, I mean... Jean's Loan Contract Gumshoe: It's for half a million dollars, pal! That's... um... half a million dollar bills! Phoenix: (What was the \"um\" in there for!?) Is there really that much money tied up in this case? Gumshoe: I can't give you an answer on that, pal. Not without the case file in front of me. But I'll tell you this... That Armstrong guy would've done anything for cash. He was desperate, you know? Phoenix: No, I don't.

I am just a pretty face! W'izout my looks, I 'ave nothing! Phoenix: So... What happened to the winning ticket, then? The one he meant to steal. Godot: Indeed. What did happen to it? I don't like spoiling myself by watching trailers, so... ...we'll just wait and see how the movie turns out tomorrow, won't we? Maya: Nngh... Armstrong: Voilà! You two! Time to laugh at la pretty little air'ead! Phoenix: (Looks like I won't be needing this note anymore.) Victor's Note thrown into the trash. Phoenix: Looks like we've got a new mystery now. Namely, where did the winning ticket go? Maya: I've got a bad feeling about this. Phoenix: Well, anyway. We can't let Maggey suffer any longer for this. And certainly not again. To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!) Recipe for Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 January 7, 9:48 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Byrde: Oh... I see... I guess I should've expected this. Nobody saw the other guy, huh? But he was there when I took the coffee over, sir. Scout's honor! ???: Maggey! Byrde: Ack! D-Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: A-Are you doing alright!? How're you feeling!? Byrde: ...As if you need to ask either question, sir. Gumshoe: Don't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK? Byrde: Roger! Gumshoe: And you! Phoenix: Y-Yes? Gumshoe: You'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest! Phoenix: (I-I think he's serious!) Maya: Hey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right? Gumshoe: Yup. Maya: So you'll be able to help Maggey out, right? Byrde: Really? Can you, sir!? Gumshoe: O... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright? Phoenix: S-Sure. Gumshoe: OK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!? Byrde: I can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you. Maya: Looks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh? Phoenix: (I can only wish...) January 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Godot: ... Aaah, bitter! Judge: Mr... Um... Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor? Judge: Aaaah! Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong!? Judge: Nothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating. Phoenix: No, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix. Judge: I see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he? Phoenix: (\"Our trusty\"...?) Judge: So, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please. Godot: Mr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today. Phoenix: But I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright! Godot: I wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out. Phoenix: (There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!) Judge: As everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial. Phoenix: (I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!) Judge: Now then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness. Godot: Let's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation? Gumshoe: ... Judge: Witness! State your name for the court! Gumshoe: Huh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe. Godot: Other way around, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir! Judge: Since yesterday? Gumshoe: Yeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now. Maya: I hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake. Judge: I see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case? Gumshoe: Y-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report. Judge: The court accepts this into evidence. Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Um... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress. Judge: The waitress being the accused? Gumshoe: Yeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo. Judge: Hmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me. Trés Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record. Godot: Come, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands. Judge: Now then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony. Gumshoe: Umm... Yes, sir... Witness Testimony -- The Incident -- Gumshoe: When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir. We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time. Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup. And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch! And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive. Judge: Hmm... Godot: Using the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady! Judge: The facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but... Phoenix: Yes? Judge: Please, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood? Phoenix: I already told you! That wasn't me! Cross Examination -- The Incident -- Gumshoe: When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Can I stop you for just a minute? Gumshoe: Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence? Phoenix: (He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's what she said. And I-- Godot: Godot: What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction? Phoenix: Hey! Godot: Sadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Well, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way. Godot: Ha...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Trés Bien, Trite! Phoenix: ...! Godot: I have here in my possession a ticket. Phoenix: A ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.) Godot: Yes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen. Judge: This is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct? Godot: I think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table? Phoenix: Urk! Judge: It certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Can I stop you for just a minute? Gumshoe: Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence? Phoenix: (He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's what she said. And I-- Godot: Godot: What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction? Phoenix: Hey! Godot: Sadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table. Judge: Hmm... Gumshoe: We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He was listening to his radio, you say? Gumshoe: Yeah. He had a portable radio in his chest pocket. Maya: Maggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\". Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: And what was it that the victim was listening to on the radio, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Huh? How should I know? Phoenix: (Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.) Maya: This isn't going very well, is it...? Judge: Hmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used? Leads back to cross-examination Gumshoe: Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else? Gumshoe: Not sure I get you, pal. Phoenix: Was the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder? Gumshoe: If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance. Phoenix: So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper... Godot: Godot: Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite? Gumshoe: The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: It seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee? Gumshoe: Huh!? What do you mean? Phoenix: According to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!? Gumshoe: Oh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think-- Godot: Godot: In case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there. Gumshoe: Huh? For me? Godot: \"Oh, hey! You're right!\"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence. Gumshoe: Th... THAT piece... sir? Godot: Yes. THAT piece. Gumshoe: ... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again? Godot: This! Phoenix: (Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?) Gumshoe: Oh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup. Godot: Yes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim. Judge: Oh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it. Godot: Conclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this! Phoenix: Uuuurgh! Gumshoe: For the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's. Coffee Cup added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Upon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance... Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else? Gumshoe: Not sure I get you, pal. Phoenix: Was the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder? Gumshoe: If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance. Phoenix: So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper... Godot: Godot: Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite? Gumshoe: The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: It seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee. Gumshoe: And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: (Potassium cyanide? I've heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: It's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history. Maya: How much is too much? Godot: A lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off. Maya: 0.2 grams? How much is that? Gumshoe: You know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much. Phoenix: (Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...) Judge: Hmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere. Gumshoe: And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Some kind of a motive\"? Gumshoe: Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion. Godot: Godot: You know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get it. Godot: I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out. Gumshoe: *gulp* Godot: So stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive? Phoenix: (Come on, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: She was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket. Phoenix: I knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.) Gumshoe: It disappeared from the scene of the crime. Godot: And it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million! Maya: Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one... Phoenix: (Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Wait a minute! The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client! Godot: Ha...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question! Judge: Th-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...? Gumshoe: One of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant. Phoenix: WH-WHAAAAAT!? Judge: Order! Order! Godot: Ha...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress. Judge: Y-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately! Phoenix: (Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...) Victim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record. Judge: The ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...? Godot: It's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor. Phoenix: (And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey's person...] in the original release) Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Victim's Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Some kind of a motive\"? Gumshoe: Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion. Godot: Godot: You know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get it. Godot: I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out. Gumshoe: *gulp* Godot: So stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive? Phoenix: (Come on, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: She was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket. Phoenix: I knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.) Gumshoe: It disappeared from the scene of the crime. Godot: And it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million! Maya: Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one... Phoenix: (Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?) Maya: You really think there are any contradictions in this testimony? Phoenix: To be honest, I don't know. Maya: But Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line? Phoenix: (I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.) After selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements: Judge: That's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime. Godot: I like an old man who knows the score. Judge: There is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules! Godot: I don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money. Maya: Not good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast. Phoenix: Yeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already. Godot: I'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence. Phoenix: (He's got more evidence against Maggey!?) Godot: This is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time. Maya: Wow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen... Phoenix: Th-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?) Godot: Ha...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself. Phoenix: The coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye... Godot: Of course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more. Judge: Something else? I presume you mean... Godot: Of course. I'm referring to the pocket. Phoenix: The... pocket? Godot: A search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket! Phoenix: A bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket? Gumshoe: Yeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it. Phoenix: WHAAAT!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence. Apron added to the Court Record. Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record. Judge: There's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court? Godot: Bloodstain? What bloodstain would that be? Judge: Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron! Godot: That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain! Phoenix: (You don't need to be told! Just look at it!) Godot: Well, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!? Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir. Phoenix: Ketchup!? Gumshoe: She must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day. Judge: ... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe! Godot: Pull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness! Gumshoe: Unnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already. Judge: Hmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case. Phoenix: ...! Judge: The motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established. Godot: Well, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all. Phoenix: (Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!) Judge: Witness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there. Witness Testimony -- The Investigation -- Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir. Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her. The victim didn't have any identification on him. But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly. When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison. And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene. Judge: Hmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good. Godot: Last chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite! Phoenix: ...! Godot: Don't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin! Cross Examination -- The Investigation -- Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Scary old man\", Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: There's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened. Phoenix: (Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...) Gumshoe: Officers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. \"What took you so long!?\" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds... Judge: Hmm... Seeds... Godot: Ha...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth. Phoenix: (I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...) Godot: The old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime. Gumshoe: Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How long was the defendant unconscious for? Gumshoe: The officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself. Phoenix: (I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...) Gumshoe: I woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful. Phoenix: (You're a professional detective, Gumshoe. Not a professional bird watcher!) Godot: Save the romantics for your own time, Detective. All we need to know about is the investigation. Gumshoe: Oops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I? Gumshoe: The victim didn't have any identification on him. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then? Gumshoe: No, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet. Phoenix: Fifty-eight cents...? Gumshoe: Yeah. I can't believe I found someone with less in their wallet than me, pal! Judge: The victim sounds like he was a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... Why not give him a bit of an edge? Phoenix: (I think I'm on to something here...) Gumshoe: But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...) Gumshoe: There was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket. Godot: It seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Trés Bien. Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?) Leave it Phoenix: (I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the prescription bag Phoenix: So what sort of medicine was in the bag? Gumshoe: Well... Actually, the bag we found was empty. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Yeah. Completely empty. Phoenix: (It was completely empty...?) Victim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record. Godot: Ha...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence? Desperate, are you, Trite? Phoenix: ...! Godot: Now, what happened with the investigation after that, Detective? Leads back to cross-examination Ask about his health insurance Phoenix: So, the victim had no form of identification on him, correct? Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: And yet, before arriving at the restaurant, he went to see a doctor. Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him! Judge: Oh! That is very true! Phoenix: The fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen! Godot: Ha...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with! Phoenix: Huh? Judge: Hmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... A bit of an edge never hurt anyone. Maya: Looks like we're off course again, Nick. Judge: Witness. Please continue with your testimony. Explain for the court the events following the preliminary investigation. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Victim's Prescription Bag is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...)

Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court. Gumshoe: When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But the defendant had been passed out for a while, correct? In that case... Isn't it possible someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket!? Gumshoe: Hey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal! Judge: Hmm... Gumshoe: It happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes! Godot: Godot: Keep up this crazy testimony, Detective, and those shoes will end up down your throat! Gumshoe: Sorry... Godot: So, Trite. \"Someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket\"...? That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence? Phoenix: Um... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...) Judge: It appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness. Gumshoe: And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for. Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: Interesting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh? Phoenix: (And they're just going to let him get away with it...?) Judge: It was just one dollar, Detective. Maya: I guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe. Present Victim's Prescription Bag Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you.\" Phoenix: If I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict! Maya: Gumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something! Phoenix: Yeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious. Maya: Come on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony. Gumshoe: Oho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you? Phoenix: You testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later? Gumshoe: Um, no. They didn't. Phoenix: The victim was given a prescription right before going to Trés Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!? Gumshoe: Y-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!! Judge: I-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!? Gumshoe: I, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh? Phoenix: The victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself! Judge: O-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that? Godot: Ha...! That's all. Phoenix: What!? Godot: Read for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will. Phoenix: What's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological? Judge: Just what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot? Godot: Hardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say. Judge: A war wound? Godot: The day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum. Phoenix: He ruptured his eardrum!? Judge: Then what on earth was the prescription he was given? Godot: It was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested! Phoenix: What!? Godot: It's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear. Judge: Yes. Here it is. In very, very fine print. Godot: It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication. Phoenix: Uuurgh... Judge: It seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all. Phoenix: N-No... Maya: Nick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over! Phoenix: (She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?) Push the medication issue Leads to: \"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\" Leave it Phoenix: It does seem as it the medication isn't connected to the case. Godot: Ha...! Maybe the last Mr. Trite was the real one. At least he didn't waste time. Judge: Indeed... If you have nothing further to add to this medication issue... ...the facts of this case seem no different to those presented on the last trial. I would therefore have no choice but to hand down my verdict. Phoenix: Uh... Umm...! Maya: Nick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground! Judge: Now then... Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Your Honor! Actually, this prescription... is absolutely pivotal to the case! Judge: Mr. Wright! Did you not just say the exact opposite only moments ago!? Phoenix: (Gotta lose a few battles in order to win the war, I suppose.) Leads to: \"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\" Phoenix: Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!? Godot: ...! Judge: But the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal! Phoenix: Phoenix: That doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth! Godot: Godot: You know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide. Phoenix: Phoenix: It hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable! Godot: Aaargh! Judge: That's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call? Godot: ... Judge: Mr. Godot...? Godot: ... Gumshoe: Um... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder. Phoenix: (Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?) Judge: Very well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me. Maya: Yay! Good job, Nick! Judge: The court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness. Godot: Ha...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups. Judge: Court is adjourned for recess! January 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Maya: Phew! That was close! Phoenix: Tell me about it... I nearly died in there! Byrde: That's my line, sir! Maya: No! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit. Byrde: Looks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!? Maya: Huh? Byrde: He said he'd help me. But he totally set me up! Phoenix: I don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right? Byrde: It's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again! Phoenix: (Poor Gumshoe...) Maya: So the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right? Phoenix: Yeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds! Byrde: I bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know? Maya: Yeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds! January 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: Court will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please. Godot: The prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand. Godot: Name and occupation, if you don't mind. Kudo: The name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too. Phoenix: We don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation. Kudo: My occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!? Phoenix: Kimono embroidery? Kudo: That's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed! Maya: Wow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime. Kudo: Anyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile! Phoenix: (That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...) Judge: Now then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident? Kudo: Oh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino. Judge: Seeds? Kudo: What do you think these are, hmm!? Judge: I-I see... Godot: So you saw everything that happened, gramps? Kudo: Did I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all! Godot: Then please, tell the court. We're all ears. Kudo: Sure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail! Phoenix: (He's really getting into this...) Witness Testimony -- What I Witnessed -- Kudo: The young man was reading the sports paper. The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed. That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well! Judge: Mr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress. Kudo: Kah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!? Judge: N-Newfangled? Kudo: All this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you! Judge: E-Excuse me... Kudo: Listen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away! Judge: Well, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Cross Examination -- What I Witnessed -- Kudo: The young man was reading the sports paper. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you saw the victim, then? You saw Mr. Glen Elg? Kudo: I wanted to know if Gusten Brawn retained his championship or not. Phoenix: (So he was looking at the sports paper the victim was reading, huh...) And at the location in question... ...there are partitions between tables on the same side of the restaurant, right? Kudo: So what if there are? Phoenix: If you say that you could see the victim... ...that means you were sitting at a table on the other side of the restaurant, correct? Kudo: Kah! I go to that place to drink javaccino! I don't go to sit! I don't remember what table I was sitting at! Phoenix: (You mean you go there to eye the waitress!) Kudo: The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw? Kudo: Victor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i! Phoenix: I see... Kudo: My eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving. Phoenix: (...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.) Kudo: And I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well! Phoenix: (I bet I know what's coming up and something tells me I'm not going to like it...) Leave it Phoenix: (It'd be dangerous to press this too much. I'd better ignore it for now.) So, what happened next? Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Your Honor. We need more clarification on what was put into the victim's coffee. I'd like to ask that the witness add what he knows about this to his testimony. Judge: Hmm... I agree. Witness, will you enlighten us, please? Kudo: Sure, sure. Adds statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\" Press (after adding statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw? Kudo: Victor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i! Phoenix: I see... Kudo: My eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving. Phoenix: (...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.) Kudo: And I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well! Kudo: There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: D-Did she really put that into the coffee? Kudo: You doubt me, boy!? She too some out of a small, brown bottle and sprinkled it in. Phoenix: Couldn't she have been adding sugar? Kudo: Sugar!? In a small, brown bottle like that!? Judge: \"Like that\"? Witness, could you please describe the bottle in more concrete terms? Godot: Ha...! A bottle like this, perhaps? Kudo: Oh, there it is! That's the one! Judge: That's the bottle of potassium cyanide, I presume? Godot: So what did the accused put into the coffee? I think it's clear, don't you? Phoenix: Argh... Kudo: The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He took just one sip? Kudo: You young'uns! You waste everything! Those javaccinos cost 8 dollars! In the good old days, we would have drank every last drop, eaten the cup, and then died! Phoenix: (Congratulations. You have earned the title of Battiest Man To Grace A Courtroom.) Godot: So it was an immediate death? Well, with potassium cyanide, I suppose that is possible. Kudo: Oh, yes. He slumped over without so much as a twitch! I felt the javaccino I'd just drank turn sour in my stomach. Godot: Oh, yes. I know that feeling. Judge: And the waitress? I presume she is...? Kudo: That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by? Kudo: Particular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is! Phoenix: Sorry? Kudo: You can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform! Phoenix: Phoenix: So the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me! Judge: Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image. Maya: Don't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together! Phoenix: (I-I guess I got a bit carried away...) Kudo: Kah! There are other things I recognize about her, too. Phoenix: (He seems pretty sure of himself. What should I do?) Leave it Phoenix: (There's got to be a better line of attack than this. That's what I should be looking for now...) Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Sure, you saw a waitress take the coffee over to the victim. But what matters is whether that waitress was Maggey Byrde or not. Judge: Quite right. Mr. Kudo. These other \"features\" that you recognize about the defendant... I would ask you to add them to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Adds statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\" Press (after adding statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by? Kudo: Particular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is! Phoenix: Sorry? Kudo: You can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform! Phoenix: Phoenix: So the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me! Judge: Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image. Maya: Don't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together! Phoenix: (I-I guess I got a bit carried away...) Kudo: Kah! There are other things I recognize about her, too. Kudo: There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (There's no doubt he remembers the waitress pretty well. What should I do? I get the feeling there's something more to this somehow...) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I must be imagining it. I need to find another angle with this guy.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the straps Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. You seem especially interested in straps. Why is that? Kudo: Wh-What? Phoenix: The ribbon in her hair, the straps on her apron. What's the fascination? Kudo: F-Fascination? Godot: Godot: People have all kinds of fetishes, Trite. We don't need to embarrass the witness. Kudo: Listen, you young upstarts! I haven't got some sick strap fetish! Judge: Hmm... Is there any relevance to the witness's unusual love of straps, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I was just curious as to why he was so fixated on the waitress's straps... Kudo: I said I haven't got a strap fetish! How many times do I have to repeat myself!? Judge: Very well. Continue with your testimony, Mr. Kudo. And make it strapless. Kudo: *grumble grumble* Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the waitress's back Phoenix: The identifying \"features\" you described are all things you would see from the back. Kudo: So what? Phoenix: Is it possible that... ...you never saw the waitress from the front at all!? Godot: Godot: Ha...! He's got you there, gramps! Phoenix: People normally talk about facial features when they're asked to describe someone. But this witness's testimony is nothing but straps and ribbons! Kudo: Th-This is harassment! I tell you I'm not obsessed with straps or ribbons! I'm just telling you what I saw! Judge: Mr. Kudo, the court requests that you add details about any identifying features... Features you observed from the front, that is, to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Maya: The old man's testimony is getting longer and longer! Phoenix: And if I can't find a hole in it soon, it'll get even longer, I bet. Adds statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\" Press (after adding statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm... Kudo: There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't find anything to be distinct, but you did clearly see the witness's face, yes? Kudo: No question about it! I didn't come this far to back down now! Victor Kudo never backs down! Phoenix: (That's not the answer I was looking for, but OK...) Maya: This has turned into a matter of pride for Old Seedy now, I guess... I wonder if he really did see Maggey's face or not... Phoenix: (Like I thought, we need some concrete proof of this. Proof that the old guy didn't see the waitress clearly from the front.) Present Apron Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\" Maya: Do you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it? Phoenix: Well, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there. Maya: But he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress... Phoenix: I-I guess... (Hmm, she makes a good point though...) Maya: Hey! Did I just say something clever? Phoenix: I wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw really was Maggey... Maya: That's what we have to figure out, Nick! Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this. Kudo: Kah! That filthy thing would suit filth like you just perfectly. Actually, it reminds me of what my grandson looks like, just after he's done eating. Phoenix: Have you ever seen this before? Kudo: Of course I haven't! Do you think I'd forget something as dirty as that!? Hmm? Well? You half-witted clot!? Phoenix: ... Judge: ... ......... Kudo: Wh-What!? What is it!? Ever since I said, \"you half-witted clot\", there's been an eerie silence in here. Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. This apron... ...is the apron worn by the defendant on the day of the poisoning! Kudo: Uh? Phoenix: And as you just said yourself... ...you wouldn't forget something like this. Which means, is you had really seen this apron before... Kudo: Er... Phoenix: Yes, you know what I'm getting at! You couldn't have possibly seen the waitress from the front! Kudo: ... Oops! Judge: Witness! You can't just \"oops\" your way out of this! Godot: Ha...! Well, well... Looks like we finally have a genuine trial on our hands. Phoenix: ... Godot: Listen, Trite. Here are the facts. On the day of the incident, there was only one waitress in the restaurant. Judge: That being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde? Godot: Exactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching! Judge: Hmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing. Godot: Just tell the court exactly what you saw, gramps. Kudo: You can rely on me, Captain! My noggin's in perfect working order. I can't remember a single occasion when I forgot what burger a customer wanted! Maya: He can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out... Judge: Very well. Let's test just how good your memory and attention to detail is, Mr. Kudo. Tell us what you remember about the victim. Witness Testimony -- About the Victim -- Kudo: He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles. He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages! The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well. Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino. The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip. Judge: The testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail. Kudo: Oh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything! Maya: How are we going to handle this, Nick? Phoenix: We only need to do one thing. We just need to prove that the old man's memory is shot. Maya: Just trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel? Phoenix: (I suppose... But it's what I do best.) Cross Examination -- About the Victim -- Kudo: He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Spectacles? Kudo: Dark glasses to you! One of the lenses was green, but the other was broken. Newfangled rubbish! That's why I remember him so well. Phoenix: (He did have some kind of lens over his left eye... But I wouldn't have called it a pair of glasses.) Judge: Hmm... He seems to have been wearing some rather modern-looking shades. Perhaps I should take to wearing some, and rival Mr. Godot's sharp appearance. Maya: Ah! We better come up with something sharp, and quick! Phoenix: (Guess I'll wait and see if I should challenge him about the \"spectacles\"...) Kudo: He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The newspaper was a sports paper, was it? Kudo: That young hooligan! I nearly asked him, \"Can't you even read without fidgeting, hmm!?\" How was I supposed to be able to read the back page with all that rustling going on!? I needed to find out if Gusten Brawn retained his championship title! Phoenix: (It was his paper, not yours! If you wanted to know so bad, why didn't you buy your own!?) Kudo: What are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? How dare you judge me! Phoenix: Ow! Ooow! Maya: Gusten Brawn got beaten yesterday, by the way. Anyway... Kudo: The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The wireless? Kudo: The decadent young rascal! In my day, it was one or the other! Read the paper, or listen to the wireless! Phoenix: (...Oh boy.) Kudo: And using an earpiece! It's selfish, that's what it is! I was straining my ears, but I couldn't catch any of it. Phoenix: (Was he that desperate to listen to the radio...?) Kudo: What are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? 2 you feel sorry for me! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Kudo: Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean the waitress, who you only saw from behind, right? Kudo: You're one of those, are you? You never let anything go, isn't that right? Phoenix: ...Maybe. Kudo: What does it matter if I saw her from the front or from behind!? My eyes don't lie! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! (I better not push it until I've got some hard evidence.) Kudo: The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"His free hand\"? Kudo: Yes. Phoenix: Which hand was that? Kudo: Weren't you listening before, cloth-ears!? I said he was rustling the newspaper with his right hand, didn't I? If his free hand wasn't his right hand, then which hand was it, you moron! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Godot: Ha...! Perhaps the great Mr. Trite has three hands! Phoenix: (Yeesh! I was only asking! No need to gang up on me and treat me like a freak!) Present Coffee Cup Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony?\" Phoenix: (The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.) Maya: I guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh? Phoenix: (Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!) Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony? That this was a way of testing the credibility of your memory? Kudo: I know, I know! There's nothing wrong with my memory, I tell you! Nothing! If I got anything wrong, I'll eat these seeds and sing the pigeon song! Godot: Care to tell us where this is going, Trite? Phoenix: According to Mr. Kudo, the victim was holding the paper in his right hand... ...while drinking coffee with his free hand, which would make that his left. Kudo: Kah! What is this? Kindergarten? Phoenix: But I would like the court to please take a look at this. Judge: That's the cup victim used, correct? Phoenix: Yes, and on the rim, you'll notice the mark left by the victim's lips. Judge: Yes. There is a stain left by the coffee. Phoenix: If you consider where that stain is, you'll clearly see... ...that the victim was holding the cup in his right hand! Kudo: But how...? Phoenix: Well, Mr. Kudo. The court is waiting for your epic performance! You said you'd eat those seeds and sing the pigeon song! Kudo: Aaaargh! Judge: Mr. Kudo... I'm afraid this is simply not acceptable. I think the witness had better go back to the park where he came from. Kudo: WAAAAIT! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to you tell me I'm mad, you're wrong! I don't care about that dirty coffee cup! I know what I saw! Judge: Y-You still insist on your testimony? Kudo: That young brat was holding the cup in his left hand! Oh, yes. No question! I'm a good, law-abiding citizen, I am. It's that dead young hotbot and you, you spikey-haired yahoo, who are at fault! Phoenix: (Who, me!?) Judge: Th-Thank you, old man. We've heard quite enough from you already. Kudo: Don't call me \"old man\", old man! Been around for 68 years, I have. You can't ignore me! LISTEN TO WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAAAAY! Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but... Godot: Sure, why not hear a little more? Judge: M-Mr. Godot! Godot: But this is my 16th cup of coffee... So this is your final stand. Kudo: Thank you, Captain! You can rely on Victor! Witness Testimony -- Left Hand or Right Hand -- Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs. He kept fiddling with it all the time. He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too. And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand! Judge: We know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye. Godot: It wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers. Judge: A monitor? You mean, like a television screen!? Godot: The inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work. Kudo: HDTV, DVD, CD... All these newfangled letters drive me mad! But they don't matter. I know what I saw, and I'm telling the truth! Phoenix: (It's true... He doesn't seem to be lying.) Kudo: And those are the facts, in good old black and white! Cross Examination -- Left Hand or Right Hand -- Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the victim was wearing an HMD. Kudo: HDTV, CD, DVD... What does it matter!? Phoenix: (It was none of them actually, but anyway...) And you're sure that he was wearing the earpiece on the same side? Kudo: No question! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting. Phoenix: (Yeah. That's pretty obvious if you look at the floor plans. From the opposite table, he'd only have a view of the side of the victim's head.) Present Victim's Prescription Bag or Glen Elg profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but...\" Kudo: He kept fiddling with it all the time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: It seems you kept an eye on Mr. Glen Elg. Kudo: He was getting on my nerves! Rustling that newspaper and fiddling with his earpiece all the time! And then he went and made all that fuss dying from one sip of javaccino! I wanted to say to him, \"Calm down, you young brat!\" Just looking at him made me suddenly speed up my seed eating! I could've chocked! Phoenix: (So I take it the victim was a walking ball of nervous energy...) Kudo: He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The earpiece you mentioned... Which hand did the victim touch it with? Kudo: ... You're one of those people! One of those people who uses his left hand to get things out of his right pocket. Or fastens his left cuff with his right hand? And when the tour guide says, \"On your right side, you'll see the famous blah-blah\"... ...you're the only one who deliberately looks left! Well? Aren't you? Phoenix: N-No! I didn't mean... Kudo: Obviously he used the hand on the same side of his body that the earpiece was in! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Ow! (So, if he had the HMD on his left side, then it was his left hand, I guess...) Kudo: And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You seem very sure of yourself, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: That's because I know what I saw, no matter what tricks you try to play on me! Phoenix: (It looks like he really did see the guy picking the cup up with his left hand. This is a dead end!) Maya: Well, Nick? What do you think? Phoenix: I think the guy's telling the truth. But even so... Something's not quite right. Maya: Then chuck evidence at him until he breaks! Phoenix: (But if he's not lying, there wouldn't be any contradictions in his testimony, right?) Phoenix: I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but... Mr. Kudo! There is something very strange about your observations of the victim. Kudo: What!? Phoenix: You say he was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the HMD. Kudo: No question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting. Phoenix: I don't think so. Kudo: Wh-What did you say!? Phoenix: You're no doubt unaware of this fact, Mr. Kudo. But the victim couldn't hear with his left ear! His eardrum was ruptured! Kudo: Eh? Phoenix: Traces of medication for his condition were found in his ear canal. That's right! It's impossible that the victim was wearing his earpiece in his left ear. Because he couldn't even hear in that ear! Kudo: ... Is that true, Captain? Godot: ...It is. Kudo: ...Pi... Pi-Pi-Pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Pretty pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Judge: Order! Order! Order! Phoenix: This witness's testimony is completely unreliable! He only saw the witness from behind. And he claims the victim was wearing an earpiece when we know his eardrum was ruptured! Well, Mr. Godot!? Godot: Aaaargh! A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup! The old man... ...is my drop of milk! Kudo: Captain! Are you calling me a drip!? Judge: This is the victim's coffee cup in which the potassium cyanide was found. The mark on the rim clearly shows that the victim picked it up with his right hand! Kudo: I'll never back down! I know I'm right! The lad drank his javaccino with his left hand! Godot: Let me put you out of your misery... Clearly, the victim used both hands. He took a sip with the cup held in his right hand, and then switched to his left... That's what the old man saw! Phoenix: Phoenix: Impossible! The witness has already testified on numerous occasions... ...that the victim died immediately after taking just one sip of the coffee. Godot: Godot: Which hand the victim used to pick up his cup is irrelevant, Your Honor. The facts still stand! With one hand or the other, Mr. Elg drank the poisoned coffee... ...Like this! Phoenix: Phoenix: Sadly, Mr. Godot, that doesn't wash! The point of this testimony was to establish whether the witness's memory was credible. And the results are clear! The testimony given by this witness is useless! Godot: Puuuurgh! Judge: I believe it is time to conclude today's proceedings. I am satisfied that the witness is not deceiving the court. But to be frank, his testimony is a farce! Kudo: D-Did you have to be so frank!? Take that, you pompous old fogey! Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo. You can't reach me from there. I'm ordering the defense and the prosecution to investigate this case further. That is all for now. This court is adjourned! ???: Kudo: WAAAAIT! If we stop now, where does that leave me? Judge: Leave you, Mr. Kudo? Kudo: Thanks to that blue-suited young upstart over there... ...I'm just a bumbling old man who can't even dot his t's or cross his i's now! Phoenix: (How is your bad memory my fault!?) Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but there's nothing I can do. Kudo: I've kept my mouth shut until now... ...but there's something else the court should know! Godot: What!? Phoenix: There's more? Kudo: To be perfectly honest, it might not be anything. But I want another chance! I want another crack at you, you young shark! Phoenix: M-Me? (He's looking at me like I'm some sort of evil Shogun...) Kudo: Well, everyone? What do you say to one final showdown? The final chapter in this eccentric old man's scrapbook! Godot: Sorry, gramps... I've already had my 17th cup of coffee. Kudo: What have you got to lose, Captain? I'll give you all the javaccino you want if you come to my house after the trial. (Changed from [I'll give you all the coffee you want if you come to my house after the trial.] in the original release) I may be 68 years old, but Victor Kudo is still a man! Judge: That's enough, witness. I believe it will be quicker for the court to just hear your testimony. Kudo: You bet! Much, much quicker! Maya: I can't believe this is happening... Kudo: Ha ha ha! You better get ready, youngster! Phoenix: I get the picture! Just quit throwing those seeds at me, would you!? (He's gotta be using some sort of infinite ammo code with that box of seeds...) Witness Testimony -- The Final Showdown -- Kudo: First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself. The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino... Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over. It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked! Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm? Judge: ... Um... Is that all? Kudo: Yes, that's all. I remember it perfectly. Eh!? You're doubting me again? You're doubting a poor, defenseless old man!? Judge: N-No. We are not doubting you, Mr. Kudo. Maya: Don't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick? Phoenix: Yeah. \"So what?\" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy! Kudo: You're a birdbrain, that's why that's all you can think of! Judge: Very well... Mr. Wright. Your final cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- The Final Showdown -- Kudo: First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Um... The court generally prefers if witnesses are sure of themselves, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Noisy brat! I'm warning you, I'm more savage than a macho man right now! You won't beat me with this testimony! This is the final battle! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! (He's chucking those seeds harder than ever! I better be careful...) Maya: Come on, Nick! Nail him! Kudo: The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The court has already heard that testimony, Mr. Kudo... Kudo: I know that! I was just setting the mood. How else am I supposed to build up the suspense, hmm!? Phoenix: The suspense? Kudo: Isn't it enough? Should I work the audience a bit more? Judge: No, no! Please continue, Mr. Kudo. As quickly as possible! Kudo: Alright. Now where was I...? ...Ah yes. The young boy slumped over the table, and... Kudo: Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A vase, you say? Kudo: Yes. There are vases on all the tables in that place. They're accidents waiting to happen! They're practically begging to be knocked over! Phoenix: (Well, he's right about there being vases. I do remember seeing them, too... There was a vase on the table when I ate munch there.) And you saw the moment when the victim actually knocked over the vase? Kudo: Well... it's hard to say... It's a bit unclear... How do you really define... Phoenix: OK, I get it. Kudo: I heard it break! And the sight of it is burned into my memory as clear as day! Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\" Kudo: It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Soaked in water, you mean? Kudo: Yes. It splashed me on the knee as well. Phoenix: You said you were sitting at a table across the room from the victim, correct? And yet, the water still managed to splash onto you? Kudo: ... It was cold! I clearly remember it splashing me! Phoenix: (Could the water really make it all the way across to the other side of the room...?) Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\" Kudo: Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean, the vase on the victim's table falling upside-down and breaking? Kudo: The vase turned upside-down, and my testimony's turning this case upside-down... It's a joke! I just wanted everyone to hear it! What do you think, Captain!? Godot: ...I'm impressed. By your ability to waste time. Phoenix: (Godot hasn't raised any objections for a while now...) Kudo: So, you young show-off! With that scrap of information, I'm throwing down the gauntlet! If I lose this one, I'll take it like a man and admit defeat! Phoenix: He's really giving you the evil eye, Maya. Maya: It's you he's looking at, Nick, not me! It's like he's saying, \"I triple dog dare you to find a contradiction, young'un!\" Phoenix: I guess I'll just have to rise to the challenge then... Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene. Kudo: Hmph! So what? Phoenix: Look carefully at the table. The vase is there... intact! Kudo: Huh? Phoenix: Lost your tongue, granddad? Kudo: ... I'm no granddad of yours, hop scotch! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Judge: Enough! If you throw any more seeds in this courtroom, the cleaners will be here all night. Kudo: Aaaaaah! Judge: ... What is it now? Kudo: I just remembered something! Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Go on... Kudo: The broken vase... Ha ha! It was on my table! Phoenix: Wha...? Kudo: Ah, well... You see... It startled me when that young lad collapsed. So I stood up. That must've been when it fell over. The vase on my table, I mean. Judge: The vase on your table? Kudo: Ah ha ha! Yes, it was on my table! And that's how my groin came to be completely soaked. ......... Judge: *sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today. Kudo: Er, I'd like to ask a question now. Have I, er... Have I been any use at all? Judge: Perhaps that's something you should reflect on yourself, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Aaaargh! WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else... Judge: Bailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom! Kudo: WAAAIT! LISTEN TO MEEEEEE! Judge: Well! We seem to have been considerably sidetracked. And I am still not in a position to deliver a verdict. Phoenix: ...! Judge: The defendant has not been positively identified as the waitress in question. Additionally, there are two disparities in the testimony we have heard thus far. Phoenix: The mark on the coffee cup that the victim supposedly drank from with his left hand. And the earpiece which was inserted into his left ear, out of which he couldn't hear. Maya: Wow, Nick! You did it! Judge: I therefore require both the defense and the prosecution to further investigate the facts. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Godot: ... Judge: There is one more thing before I call today's session to an end. Phoenix: O-One more thing, Your Honor? Judge: The witness we just heard from... He is most insistent that his testimony should be of use. So he's summarized it accordingly into this statement. Phoenix: Um... OK... Judge: You may each have a copy of it, if you wish. Godot: Whatever. The prosecution doesn't need props like that. Maya: Godot's really mad, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. I would be, too. Judge: Very well. Here you are then, Mr. Wright. There are 3 copies. My own, yours, and Mr. Godot's. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Victor's Testimony added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (\"I'm sorry\"? This isn't a piece of testimony! More like a five year old's apology...) Maya: What the heck are we supposed to do with 3 copies...? Judge: That is all. This court is adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned! Recipe for Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 January 7, 12:52 PMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: So how do you think the trial went this morning? Phoenix: How do you think it went!? Maya: It got a bit crazy in there. I just wonder if that killed our chances. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess it did get out of hand. Mr. Kudo's testimony did nothing to help us. Plus, now we don't even know the identity of the waitress who laced the coffee. Maya: All we know is what old Mr. Kudo saw... The apron straps, and the ribbon. Phoenix: And that the victim was wearing an earpiece when his eardrum was ruptured. Maya: Talk about a terrifying case of contradictionitus. Phoenix: Time to play doctor and find ourselves a cure then, huh? Maya: Yeah, we've gotta find one for Maggey, or she's going to have a terminal case of guilty! Talk What to do Phoenix: Well? I'm officially at a loss as to where to start. Maya: Yeah, me too. Let's try some brainstorming. You go first. Phoenix: I guess we should try to put Mr. Kudo's testimony to some sort of use. Maya: Yeah, that's true. Phoenix: And we need to figure out the identity of the waitress and who the victim really was... Somehow, I think the key to this case has got to be at Trés Bien. Maya: Well then, let's go back there and check it out again. Oh! And we should drop in on Maggey and see how she's doing, too. Any ideas Phoenix: So... Anything on your mind? Maya: Actually, there is something... Phoenix: ...? Maya: I was wondering about Xin Eohp... You know, like what he's like and stuff. Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I almost forgot about that guy. ???: I atta beat you so hard, it'll feel like youse were smoochin' the express train! ???: Phoenix Wright? Youse sayin' YOU' Phoenix Wright? ???: Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only! Phoenix: Actually... I've learned a little something about my doppelganger. Maya: Huh? You did? What did you find out? Phoenix: (Oh, yeah, Maya was working at the restaurant when I ran into Don Foneeonay...) Let's just say he was such a terrible version of me that I wanted to sue for defamation! (What's that guy's story, anyway? What does he have to gain by impersonating me?) Present Attorney's Badge Maya: That badge is totally useless, Nick. Phoenix: Huh!? Maya: I mean, no one suspected that Xin Eohp wasn't a real lawyer. I bet he didn't have an attorney's badge! Phoenix: ...I guess you're right. Maya: Or maybe he did have one! And maybe he switched your real one for a \"fugazzi\"! Phoenix: My badge? A fake!? ... Ha ha ha... That's a good one, Maya... Maya: Why the nervous laughter? ...Aha! I knew it! Your badge really IS fake, isn't it Nick? Sports Paper Maya: This doodle here... It was drawn by the victim, right? Phoenix: This is a newspaper from the day of the incident, so, yeah, we've got to assume so. There must be a clue in there somewhere. Maya: I guess we should show it around and see if anyone can tell us more about it. Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe there's a fake Nick running around. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. What's the deal with that? Why's he impersonating me? Maya: Maybe he's got something against you. People do tend to have a distinct distaste for you, Nick. Phoenix: (True enough... The only thing prosecutors seem to like about me is pushing me around...) Maya: Or... maybe he's got something against Maggey. Phoenix: (So he pretended to be me to get Maggey convicted?) Scooter Maya: That thing must've been in an accident. It's a total wreck! Phoenix: That's what the guy I met at the park was riding. And I'm betting he's the fake me. ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only! Phoenix: His voice is still ringing in my ears. Maya: Introduce me next time, Nick! I want to meet Xin Eohp, too! Jean's Loan Contract Maya: A loan of half a million dollars! I wonder what Mr. Armstrong did to get into that much debt. Phoenix: I'm going to guess he spent money needlessly. You'd better watch your spending, too. Maya: Hey, I've got a great idea! What if Mr. Armstrong charged $20,000 for the Twin-T set? Phoenix: If you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back! Victor's Testimony Maya: A letter of apology from the old man? Aww, how sweet. Phoenix: Actually, it's his \"testimony\"... If you can call it that. Maya: So? What's it say? ...\"I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry.\"? Heh heh! I used to break things all the time when I was little, you know. And I used to have to write apologies all the time, too. Phoenix: (Well, Pearls and Adrian seem to have picked up where you left off...) Coffee Cup Maya: That's the cup the poison was in, isn't it? Phoenix: Yeah, and the stain on the rim shows that the victim used his right hand to pick it up. Maya: But the old man swore he saw the victim pick it up with his left hand... Phoenix: (If Mr. Kudo wasn't mistaken, then what could account for this contradiction...?) Victim's Lottery Ticket Maya: Maybe I should try the lottery sometime, too. Phoenix: Sure, why not? If you hit the jackpot, you could win half a million bucks. Maya: So, what are you waiting for, Nick? Buy one! Phoenix: No way! Don't you know the lottery is a tax on people who are bad at math! Maya: Blah. Fine then. At least I can add it to the newly renamed \"Paths to Wealth\"! I'll have to call Pearly later and have her add, \"Buy lottery tickets whenever possible.\" Apron Maya: It's almost surreal that this artsy apron is what got us this far. Phoenix: Well, as art goes, this piece definitely leaves an impression. Maya: I guess that means the old guy never saw the front of it, huh? Which means he didn't see the waitress's face, either... Potassium Cyanide Maya: I can't believe they found this in Maggey's pocket. Phoenix: Yeah, but she was passed out, right? So the killer could've easily planted it on her. Maya: Where do you even get a hold of something like this? It's not like you can go down to your local CostMo' and buy it in bulk for $5 a pound! Phoenix: (She has got a point... How the killer got a hold of this poison is pretty important.) Victim's Prescription Bag Maya: \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\". Hmm... I guess if your eardrum was ruptured, you couldn't listen to the radio, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. It'd be pretty pointless to wear an earpiece of any kind. Maya: The medication in the bag is missing too, right? Phoenix: (The mysterious vanishing medication... Much like our mysterious \"other person\"...) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since then. I think Mia said it's because Maya's \"at a loss these days\"...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia really bailed me out again yesterday. Maya: Argh! That seedy old man was so rude to me! He didn't realize just how awesome I am. If he had, I bet he would've treated me better. Phoenix: Since when did you become so awesome? Godot profile Maya: Godot got it good today, huh? He was even smoking at me end there! Phoenix: He'll have a new witness ready for tomorrow, though. You can count on it. (We need to figure out the facts before then, or we're doomed!) Maggey Byrde profile Maya: A lot of strange conflicting things kept popping up today in the trial, huh? Phoenix: Yeah, and they seemed to come out of nowhere. Maya: That's why we've gotta go talk with Maggey and get out this whole thing straightened out! Phoenix: (Maggey said that when she brought the victim his coffee... ...there was one more people sitting at the table. This single contradiction is probably the most important one we have to resolve...) Glen Elg profile Maya: Have you noticed the victims in our cases tend to be people we know nothing about, Nick? Take Glen Elg, for example. Phoenix: Now that you mention it... Maya: We don't know what kind of guy he was, or why he was killed. I say it's time to get out there and find some answers! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: I really felt sorry for Gumshoe today. He really wanted to help Maggey out, but he kept getting backed into a corner. Phoenix: Maggey took it pretty bad, didn't she? Do you think she feels betrayed? Maya: Maybe. We've got to cheer her up somehow. She's a friend, after all. Phoenix: (A friend? Hmm... Never really thought of it that way, but I guess she is.) Victor Kudo profile Maya: It's the seedy old man! What's his name again? Phoenix: Vermin Kudo, is it? I can't remember, either. I've never seen a witness mess up so badly in court before. Maya: Better stay away from him a while, huh? Phoenix: (Yeah. It might be more than seed that he chucks at me next time.) Jean Armstrong profile Maya: The chef's a witness too, right? Phoenix: I suppose so. He was in the kitchen at the time of the incident. Maya: Well, since Old Man Seeds's testimony is pretty much useless to us... ...I guess we should speak to Mr. Armstrong again, huh? January 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: Looks like Gumshoe's not here. Phoenix: Never mind that. What's going on? It feels different in here somehow... Maya: You think? Phoenix: Yeah. Everyone seems to be on edge. Detective: What are you doing!? Call in the officers for the briefing, quick! Can't you shut down the station's server? Chief! Quit playing on the Internet! Chief: But my e-mail pen pal, 1337aZnPrInceSz! Detective: Save it for later! I'm turning it off NOW! Chief: Noooo! 1337aZnPrInceeeeeSz!! Maya: Everyone's keeping busy in here, huh? Phoenix: Keeping busy? More like panicking, if you ask me. (Something's going on. Something big...) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Even pickpockets can have their pockets picked.\" That's a keeper! Better to go with something that doesn't sound too much like a slogan. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a crime prevention campaign... ...But I'm not sure even he knows what kind of crime he's trying to prevent. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut. Chief: Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to write her a real letter instead of an email. Phoenix: (Alternately, you could write up some reports... Just a suggestion.) Chief: \"Dear 1337aZnPrInceSz, How are you? I'm OK! How was the show last night...?\" Maya: Wow, what an awesome job! Maybe I should send in my resume and become chief! Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\"! Right, Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Um... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: I guess Maggey's still in questioning. Maya: But! But we've got questions to ask her, too! Magg-ey! Magg-ey! Phoenix: Keep it down, Maya! This isn't a playground, you know! January 7Trés Bien Maya: Empty, as usual. Phoenix: Yeah, and it's lunchtime, too. ???: That's it! Come on, come on, come on! Phoenix: Hey, that sounds like... Gumshoe: Now just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can! Maya: He's getting really worked up about something. Gumshoe: Noooooo! That's the wrong number! Argh! Look like an \"8\" would have only netted me five bucks anyway! What a rip off! Maya: What's the problem, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Huh!? Oh, it's you... I, uh... I was uh... Hah hah! I was just... Hah hah hah! I was just listening to the radio, pal. Phoenix: To the radio? Maya: Hey, Detective Gumshoe's having lunch here! Phoenix: (He is! And he's having the Twin-T set...) Gumshoe: Aha ha ha... What can I say...? Examine Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Maya: It could say \"Entrance\" or \"Exit\", too. Did you think of that? Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: Hey, Nick. Do you think Old Seedy was talking about a vase like this today in court? Phoenix: It does look like it's ready to fall over any second. Looks kind of fragile, too. Maya: I bet if Mr. Armstrong charged 10,000 dollars for every vase a customer broke... ...he'd be able to pay off his loan really quickly. Phoenix: If you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got ya! I was just kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Maya: Wow, you really can't see the table in front or behind you at all! It's the perfect setup for slipping poison into your enemy's coffee. Talk Today's trial Gumshoe: This is a nightmare! How am I supposed to look Maggey in the eye now, pal!? Maya: You really drove her into a corner, you know. Gumshoe: You always blow apart my testimony! Why, of all days, didn't you do it today!? Phoenix: S-Sorry... There just weren't any holes in it... for once! Maya: Yeah, what happened? Usually, your testimonies are like Swiss cheese! Gumshoe: S-Swiss cheese...? Phoenix: (Would he have preferred, \"crumbly like aged parmesan\"? Anyway, this case has already been ruled on. There shouldn't be any holes left to find.) Gumshoe: So... Did Maggey say anything to you? About me, I mean. Maya: Well, um... How did she put it again...? Byrde: I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again! Maya: Something like that. Gumshoe: Wah... Waaaaaaaaaah! Maya: P-Please! Detective Gumshoe! I didn't mean... Gumshoe: Why!? Why is this happening!? Maya: He's banging his head against the wall, Nick! Phoenix: (Oh, man... Poor Gumshoe...) Lunch special Phoenix: So, did you like the Twin-T set? Gumshoe: I've never paid that much money for lunch before. I was so nervous, my hands were shaking. Maya: So? How did it taste!? Gumshoe: Well... For 20 bucks, I guess... I dunno how to describe it, really. It was... delicate. Maya: Delicate? Phoenix: You mean you liked it!? It didn't taste bad to you? Gumshoe: ... Maya: What's the matter with him? Phoenix: Looks like he's thinking... Gumshoe: ... That's it! I've been trying to think of the right word to describe the taste. I just got it right now... \"Bad\"! That's it. It tasted bad! Phoenix: *sigh* Gumshoe: It's kinda hard to admit it to yourself when you pay 20 bucks though, pal. Phoenix: (Maybe he should've found out about the price AFTER he had finished eating...) Maya: Maybe that's why Glen Elg came here. Maybe he heard about the famous Twin-T set! Phoenix: (Glen Elg, the victim, huh... Which reminds me. We still hardly know anything about the guy.) Maya: Why don't we ask Gumshoe what he knows, seeing as he's here? The radio Maya: So what were you all excited about earlier? Gumshoe: Huh? Phoenix: That's right! You said you were listening to the radio or something. Gumshoe: Oh, that? That was nothing! I-I wasn't excited! Maya: Come on, Detective Gumshoe! You can tell little ol' me! What were you listening to? Gumshoe: N-Nothing, really. It was just the, um... \"Daily Exercise Show\"! 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (What the...!? A Psyche-Lock?) Gumshoe: Hah hah hah! Mmm... This lunch special's lobster is great! Maya: Then why are there tears in your eyes...? The radio (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Lock) Maya: Come on, Detective Gumshoe. You can tell us what you were listening to on the radio. Gumshoe: But I already told you. It was the, um... the... weather forecast, pal. Phoenix: (Didn't you say it was an exercise program earlier!?) 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Gumshoe: It was nothing, really. Hah hah hah! Phoenix: (Even if it's nothing, the fact that he's hiding it makes me really curious!) The radio (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Gumshoe: I'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try. Phoenix: What's with everyone and the lottery...? Maya: So? How did it go? Gumshoe: I won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad! Phoenix: (Yeah, I know the feeling.) Gumshoe: I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg, see. (Changed from [I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg.] in the original release) And they've got this special radio show where they announce the winning numbers. (Changed from [When they read those results out on the radio, it really gets your heart pumping!] in the original release) They even do the drawings live on the air! It's intense, pal! (Changed from [You know they broadcast it live when they're picking the numbers? It's intense, pal!] in the original release) Maya: I bet that's what Mr. Elg was listening to on the day he was killed. (Changed from [I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.] in the original release) Phoenix: Yeah. What time is it now? Gumshoe: Uh, it's... It's just after 1:30. Phoenix: And are the lottery results always broadcast at the same time? Gumshoe: Yeah. Look, I got this flyer when I bought the ticket. Millionaire Radio Flyer added to the Court Record. Maya: \"Millionaire Radio\"? That sounds cool! I want to try it, Nick! Phoenix: Then buy a ticket, Maya. With your own money! The radio (subsequent times) Gumshoe: I'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try. Phoenix: What's with everyone and the lottery...? Maya: So? How did it go? Gumshoe: I won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad! Phoenix: (Yeah, I know the feeling.) Gumshoe: I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg, see. (Changed from [I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg.] in the original release) And they've got this special radio show where they announce the winning numbers.

(Changed from [I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.] in the original release) I want to try it, Nick! Phoenix: Then buy a ticket, Maya. With your own money! Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? Gumshoe: It tells me the guy is cruising for a bruising! Maya: You're really caring, aren't you, Detective Gumshoe? About Maggey, I mean. Magatama (after clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, before breaking Psyche-Lock) Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- The Radio -- Phoenix: Alright, Detective Gumshoe, tell me the truth. What were you listening to? Gumshoe: No way, pal. Now that you've made a big thing out of it, I'm not gonna tell you... Phoenix: We'll see about that, pal. Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening... ...it's pretty clear what kind of radio program it was. I'd say it was related to... Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm right, aren't I?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Detective Gumshoe!? Gumshoe: Yeah! That's it, pal! You got me. You sure are something! Phoenix: (Then how come I'm still seeing the lock? Guess I was wrong... Now, what was it he shouting when he was listening to the radio...?) Gumshoe: That's it! Come on, come on, come on! Gumshoe: Now just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can! Gumshoe: Noooooo! That's the wrong number! Phoenix: (It seems so obvious... I'd better ask him again.) Gumshoe: D-Don't tell me you're not through yet... Leads back to: \"Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening...\" Phoenix: I'm right, aren't I? You were listening to the lottery results, weren't you? You thought you'd try to win big, just like Glen Elg did! Gumshoe: I-It's... It's like you can see right through me! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (Huh? I've cracked him already...?) Gumshoe: That's why I said it was nothing! Unlock Successful Sports Paper Gumshoe: That's the sports paper the victim wrote something in, right? ... Maya: What is it? Gumshoe: I know I've heard that name somewhere before... \"MC Bomber\"... Yeah... I heard it real recently, too... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Lunch Special Gumshoe: I haven't got anything to say about that, pal. ... Just take it away already, please? Phoenix: (Spending 20 dollars on this has got to be killing him inside...) Scooter Gumshoe: Hey! Are you putting this up for sale, pal? Phoenix: N-No! Why, would you want a busted up scooter like this anyway? Maya: Yeah. Plus, the seat's all covered in pigeon poop! Gumshoe: Who cares? If it runs, that's all that matters to me. Phoenix: (My phony was riding this bike... Maybe if I head back to the park. it'll be there again.) Victim's Lottery Ticket Gumshoe: A one-way ticket to happiness, huh? Phoenix: Glen Elg died because of this ticket. Gumshoe: Yeah, but it's still a one-way ticket to happiness, pal. Phoenix: And Maggey was found guilty of murder because of it, too. Gumshoe: ... Maya: ...Looks like anything about Maggey is an instant conversation stopper. Phoenix: Yeah. He's got a real soft spot for her, and it obviously hurts when you hit it! Apron Gumshoe: That's the apron Maggey was wearing. Yeah, it still smells like her, too. Maya: Does this mean Maggey smells like ketchup? Victim's Prescription Bag Gumshoe: We never did find the contents of that bag. Maya: It was medicine for Mr. Elg's ruptured eardrum, right? Gumshoe: Yeah. We found traces of it in his left ear canal. He must've used it while he was at Trés Bien. We're sure of that much. Millionaire Radio Flyer Gumshoe: Apparently everyone's listening to this show now. Maya: That's because everyone wants money. Gumshoe: They say that the victim, Glen Elg, was really into gambling. Maya: Yep. You can't beat gambling! I love it, too! I won 500 dollars last night playing cards with Nick. Phoenix: Huh? We were playing for money!? Maya: Of course! So you'd better pay up! Gumshoe: You're a smart one! ...Waiting for a cop to be present before asking for the cash! Godot profile Gumshoe: Mr. Godot agreed to take this case just so he could face you, pal. He was working on a bunch of more important cases, but he cancelled them all... Maya: Huh? But then... ...why didn't Mr. Godot take this case... ...when Maggey's first trial came up? Phoenix: Yeah. that is kinda odd. I mean, everyone thought the defense was \"Phoenix Wright\". So why didn't he try to fight \"me\" then? Gumshoe: Well, according to Mr. Godot... ...he knew the guy was a phony right away, so he didn't want to bother with the trial. Phoenix: (He couldn't be bothered to tell the judge!?) Maggey Byrde profile Gumshoe: Maggey's probably crying all alone right now, huh... Maya: Yeah, thanks to you. Gumshoe: Aaaaaaargh! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! Phoenix: Maya! Don't torch poor Gumshoe feelings like they're are some sort of cheap crème brûlée! Maya: You're really crazy about Maggey, aren't you? Gumshoe: No! No, no! I'm just... I'm not... It's not that I... Phoenix: (You don't have to hide it, Gumshoe! It's pretty obvious.) Maya: Yeah, you're way too plain-looking for Maggey. Right? Gumshoe: I'd arrest you right now if you weren't so right... Glen Elg profile Gumshoe: This guy was a real programming genius. They called him \"the walking computer\" at the place where he worked. Maya: What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!? Phoenix: (*groan* He wasn't LITERALLY a computer, Maya!) (Changed from [*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!] in the original release) Gumshoe: Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim. Phoenix: Yeah. That's what we found out yesterday, too. Maya: Hey, Detective Gumshoe. Don't you have any information that's a bit more fun? Gumshoe: F-Fun? I, uh... Oh! I know! So, have you paid a visit to where Elg worked yet? You might as well. Maya: His workplace? Where's that? Gumshoe: A computer firm called \"Blue Screens, Inc.\" or something like that. Maya: Sounds like a real stable company. This could be fun, Nick. Let's go! Phoenix: Computers aren't really my thing, Maya. Maya: We'll be fine! I know all about that hi-tech stuff. Phoenix: (I wonder about that...) Gumshoe: It's just around the corner from this joint. You should take a look. Phoenix: (A computer firm called \"Blue Screens, Inc.\" huh...) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I know I look a little rough around the edges. But the truth is, I'm a lot more \"detective-like\" than I used to be. Maya: Really? Like what part? Gumshoe: ...Like the color of my coat. Maya: Ah! You're right! Phoenix: (Yeah, but what about what's inside the coat...?) Victor Kudo profile Gumshoe: You know, in all my years, I've never seen a witness who was that confused before. Phoenix: Yeah, you looked pretty confused by his testimony. Gumshoe: Nothing against old guys, I like them and all... But... He sounded like he was pretty sure about what he saw. Maya: Yeah, that's the impression I got, too! Phoenix: (Me, three... But then, why doesn't even a single part of his testimony corroborate any of the facts?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh lá lá! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Maya: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". But I'll tell you want. This stuff works like a charm. I slept like a rock last night. Phoenix: O-Oh, really... That's nice... Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal... I can't discuss anything connected to the case. Maya: Hey! I thought you said you were going to help us out! Gumshoe: I can't help you out if I don't have any info! Phoenix: Yeah, I suppose the retrial has only just begun... January 7Vitamin Square Maya: Hmm... I don't see any sign of Mr. Kudo. Do you? Phoenix: Maybe he went to buy another ton of bird seeds. I was kind of hoping he wouldn't be here, anyway. At least, not for now. (Besides, any more seeds today and I'm liable to turn into a real phoenix!) Examine Scooter Maya: Hey, check this out... Phoenix: I wouldn't get too close to that if I were you. Otherwise you might be in for a shock. My phony must be lurking someplace nearby... Just imagine! A Tiger, loose in the city! Maya: Meanwhile the real Phoenix is like an abandoned chick, lost in a vast urban jungle! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Don't worry. Someday, you'll grow up and become a ferocious tiger, too! Don't lose hope! Phoenix: (Why is she trying to pep-talk me into becoming my phony...?) Orange Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: Speaking of fun, if we get Maggey acquitted, may be can all get together sometime. Maya: OK! ...But what do we play with someone who's never even won a game of Tic-Tac-Toe? Phoenix: How about we change the rules a bit, then? We could play Old Maid, and... um... We could say the person who's left with the old maid at the end is the winner. How's that? Maya: Not bad... Not bad at all! We could even rename the game to \"Fair Maiden\"! January 7Trés BienKitchen Maya: Huh? Mr. Armstrong's talking to someone. ???: I'll be back next month. Armstrong: Oui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you! ???: If you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here. Armstrong: Non! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise! ???: I love fire, you know... I love the way it crackles... Hee... Hee... Hee... Armstrong: Non, non, non! Stop it! I beg you! ???: Then don't let me down... I'll be watching you... Armstrong: Mais, non! Z'is is not necessary! You can trust me, mademoiselle! ???: Talk to anyone... and I'll drive a knife... right through your heart. Armstrong: Oh, non! You do not 'ave to worry. You know, you worry far too much. Maybe z'is will 'elp you relax. It is la oil of sandalwood. ???: I do love... raw meat... from time to time... Hee... Hee... Hee... Armstrong: Aaaaah! ???: I'll be taking my leave... Goodbye... for now! Armstrong: Urgh! I 'ave la shivers! I must rub some of my oil all over my body before I become z'e nervous wreck! Z'ere. Oh, oui, oui! Z'at feels good! Phoenix: Urgh! Armstrong: Oh là là! Excusez-moi, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My eyes! My EYES! Armstrong: Your eyes? If you 'ave trouble wi'z your eyes, you need z'is. La oil of sandalwood! Phoenix: Isn't this just the leftovers of what you were just using!? Examine Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I ate yesterday for lunch? Maya: Yeah, I think it's been permanently burned into my brain now... ...as an example of what truly awful food tastes like. Phoenix: (I bet it'd taste really good if it was prepared well. ...Balsamy even!) Talk Trés Bien Phoenix: You don't exactly have many customers, do you, Mr. Armstrong? Armstrong: Non, you are right, monsieur. But per'aps z'at is la perfect time for you to visit me, non? Now I can give you my undivided attention, and cook for you la dish suprême! Phoenix: Putting on a brave face, huh? Maya: That's what girls do, Nick! Armstrong: But you are right. Business is very difficult z'ese days. Per'aps ze name is la problem. People do not understand it. Z'ey think it is \"tray\". I just wanted people to think z'at my restaurant was exclusive. Phoenix: But they think you just serve fast food on cheap, plastic trays? Maya: Nick! That's the kind of thing that can make a girl cry! Phoenix: Have you forgotten that Mr. Armstrong is a man, Maya? Armstrong: But z'is restaurant is my life! It is everything to me! I will defend it to la finale! No one will take it from me! The woman just now Phoenix: So who was that woman you were just talking to? Armstrong: Oh lá lá! You saw z'at? Phoenix: Ah, well... Yes. Sorry. Maya: So? Who was she!? She looked so polite and graceful. Armstrong: P-Polite!? G-Graceful!? Maya: And she likes raw meat and fires, right? ???: I'll be back next month. Armstrong: Oui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you! ???: If you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here. Armstrong: Non! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise! Phoenix: (Now that I think about it...) Hey, Maya... I think it's pretty clear what kind of conversation they were having. Maya: You think so? Well, then let's show him that piece of evidence and see what happens! The woman just now (appears after presenting Jean's Loan Contract) Phoenix: The woman who was here earlier... I take it that she's... um... Armstrong: Why 'as it come to z'is...? What a tragedy! Suddenly I find myself so deep in la debt. It is a sign of la bad, bad world we live in, uh? Phoenix: (No. I'd say it's more of a sign of la bad, bad culinary skills...) Armstrong: Z'e woman who was 'ere... Z'e scary woman... She is from la loan office. Phoenix: Loan office? Is that where you borrowed half a million dollars from? Armstrong: Oui. Tender Lender, it is called. Maya: Catchy name. Just hearing it makes me wanna borrow some money. Armstrong: Please! You must not borrow from z'em. If you must, no more z'an ten dollars! Phoenix: Ten dollars? Sounds like your whole monthly stipend, Maya... Maya: Hey! I get a bit more than that, thank you very much! Phoenix: So Tender Lender is the loan office you borrowed half a million from, huh? Maya: I wonder if they've got anything to do with this case... Tender Lender (appears after \"The woman just now\") Armstrong: I am a weak woman. When I am upset, I 'ave to buy something nice to cheer me up. Thanks to 'im loaning me la money, I 'ave to pay back 'alf a million dollars now! I am like 'is slave. I 'ave to do everything z'at 'e tells me. Maya: Um... Who's this he? Armstrong: La Tiger... Maya: The Tiger? Armstrong: Oui. 'E is la manager of z'e Tender Lender. A terrifying man! La big city mobster! When 'e shouts at me, my knees are trembling and 'is voice is ringing in my ears for 3 days! As soon as I 'ear la noise of z'at battered old scooter 'e rides, I start to cry! Phoenix: (A big city mobster who rides a battered old scooter...?) Um, does this guy resemble me by any chance? Armstrong: Oh, non, non, non! Z'is man 'as a presence! A most formidable personality! Although... Oui, 'e does 'ave la spikey 'air just like you. Oui, z'ere is a resemblance z'ere, I suppose. Phoenix: (Hmm... Sounds like this loan office is worth checking out after all...) Armstrong: If you want to visit z'e Tender Lender, it is just beyond Vitamin Square. Maya: Hey, Nick... If you need money, I can loan you some... As long as it's less than 3 dollars... Phoenix: Um... Thanks for the offer... (...Just beyond Vitamin Square, huh?) Present Magatama Armstrong: Oh, what a beautiful pendant! It would look stunning on me w'iz la earrings! Maya: Please don't steal it again, OK? It's one of a kind! Armstrong: I could just 'ave a sliver of it, non? Maya: I-It's not a block of cheese, you know! Sports Paper Phoenix: This is the paper the victim brought with him. Armstrong: \"MC Bomber\"...? Oui... Maya: Does that mean something to you? Armstrong: Non, I only speak French, mademoiselle. Maya: But we found it behind your magazine rack... Armstrong: Oh, 'ow naughty I am! I 'aven't cleaned for such a long time! Lunch Special Armstrong: Oh là là! So you 'ave eaten my lunch, oui? Tell me, monsieur. Did you enjoy la lunch I prepared for you? Phoenix: It was a... unique and... wild mixture of flavors. Maya: That was the first time I ever had lobster, you know! Armstrong: Lobster? Z'ere was no lobster in my lunch... Maya: Huh? But, it said, \"lobster\" right on the menu. Armstrong: Mademoiselle Maya. Please, you must read la menu more carefully. It says, \"A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with a balsamic vinaigrette. Maya: Oh. It's \"inspired\", is it? Armstrong: Oui. \"Inspired\" by z'ese ingredients, but not per'aps made from z'em, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Well, guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, Nick. Phoenix: (The way the lunch tasted, it's probably 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.) Scooter Armstrong: ... Maya: What is it? Armstrong: Is z'is your scooter? Phoenix: No, no! I saw it before in Vitamin Square, you see... Armstrong: Mon dieu! Non, non, non! Take it away! Do not show z'at to me! Phoenix: (Talk about an allergic reaction...) Jean's Loan Contract Armstrong: So long as z'at paper exists, I am but a delightful angel w'iz la broken wings! Maya: An angel, huh...? Doesn't bode well, when you think about it... Armstrong: Oui! Z'ey kept 'arassing me month after month. In z'e end, I 'ad to give in. I agreed to 'elp z'em. Maya: Help them? With what? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr, if I did not owe z'em la money, I would 'ave refused. But my 'ands were tied! Phoenix: Please! What did you agree to help them with? Armstrong: Non. I-I cannot say! If I tell you, z'at woman, she will slice me up... ...and eat me w'iz la salad garnish! Phoenix: (Eww! I hope he doesn't mean that he'll literally be sliced up and served with garnish...) I'm going to guess that woman has something to do with your loan contract. Am I right? Armstrong: Ah! Maya: Please, Mr. Armstrong, tell us about that woman! Victor's Testimony Armstrong: Ah, it is true. My vases are broken all z'e time. I bought a new one z'e next day after la incident. But z'ey wouldn't let me put it on la table because of la investigation. Victim's Lottery Ticket Armstrong: If only I 'ad taken z'e right lottery ticket... I would not 'ave any debts right now. I would be free! Maya: Look on the right side, Mr. Armstrong. You won a dollar, right? Phoenix: (A lack of remorse for having stolen something: Priceless.) Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: You 'ave la perfect face for a waitress, you know. Maya: Um, thanks. I guess if things don't work out someday, then maybe I'll be back. Phoenix: (What things? Is she talking about her being a spirit medium...?) Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Oh, 'ow it 'urts me to see z'at poor girl's face! Phoenix: Maggey's? Armstrong: I 'eard she was super'umanly un'appy. Maya: Superhumanly...? Armstrong: And if she 'adn't come to work for me, she wouldn't 'ave got into z'is mess. Phoenix: (Huh? I'm missing something here, aren't I?) Armstrong: Je suis désolé, Maggey! Forgive me! After presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien: January 7Blue Screens, Inc. Maya: Wow! This place is so hi-tech! You can almost smell the electricity in the air! Phoenix: It is a computer firm, Maya. They can't work without electricity, you know. ???: Who are you? Maya: Oh, umm... Hello... ???: I'm sorry. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only. This is a computer programming laboratory. There are far too many trade secrets that could be leaked. Maya: Wow! What secrets!? ???: Everything you see here is classified. No information can leave this building. Maya: Understood! Phoenix: (Who is this woman? She's like a robot from some kind of whacked edumacational show...) Basil: My name is Lisa Basil. I'm the company director. Phoenix: D-Director!? (Sh-She's human!? She seems more like a ghost in a shell. And that thing over her eye... Isn't that the same device as Glen Elg's?) Maya: That's an [sic] DMH, right? Phoenix: Nice try, but it's the other way around, Maya. It's an HMD. Basil: All of my programmers here at Blue Screens, Inc. are supplied with HMDs. Maya: Then do you write programs, too? Basil: No. I just enjoy wearing this. Maya: They ARE pretty cool! I wouldn't mind one! Examine Pillars Phoenix: Those pillars almost look like they're moving. It's kind of unsettling. Maya: Nah, they just look a bit twisted or warped or whatever word I'm looking for... Basil: This office was designed with a futuristic feel in mind. Maya: Futuristic? Basil: Yes. We tried to imagine what things might look like in the future when we designed it. It helps to soothe and calm the soul. Maya: ... On second thought, I agree with you, Nick. This place is really unsettling. Super computer Maya: Hey, look Nick! It's a super-computer! It looks like it's really smart and wise, doesn't it? Phoenix: Computers are only as smart as the humans who use them, Maya. Maya: That explains why we don't use the computer in our office! Phoenix: You work there too, Maya. Maya: Yeah, but at least I'm... Basil: Please. Don't argue about something that's so trivial. Otherwise the computer will laugh at you. Maya: She said she'd laugh at us, Nick. Phoenix: (She's a human, Maya, not a computer!) Programmers Phoenix: He's really pounding that keyboard, isn't he? Maya: Wow! I bet that's where the \"pro\" in \"programmer\" comes from, huh? I guess I shouldn't be resting on my laurels. Gotta expand my skill set and all that. Phoenix: Yeah, that's a good idea. Maya: Maybe I could become Old Seedy's apprentice. Phoenix: (Um... And what about your spirit medium training?) Tickets on floor Maya: Wow! Look at this mess! Phoenix: Looks like they're all betting tickets. Maya: What kind of betting tickets? Phoenix: For betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets. Maya: Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these... Phoenix: (Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.) Glen Elg's Losing Horse Racing Tickets gathered up. Maya: This many tickets would get you... what? A buck down at the recycling center? But I didn't know you were so hard up that you'd try to profit from the dead, Nick. (Changed from [You're hopeless, Nick. You know that?] in the original release) Phoenix: (I'm just taking them as evidence, Maya!) Tickets on floor (subsequent times) Maya: Wow! Look at this mess! Phoenix: Looks like they're all betting tickets. Maya: What kind of betting tickets? Phoenix: For betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets. Maya: Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these... Phoenix: (Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.) Horse calendar Maya: Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess! Phoenix: Looks pretty average to me. Maya: But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this. Phoenix: You think? Real whiz-kids can work under any condition, you know. Maya: ...! Phoenix: (She's trying to hint that I should tidy my desk more. I'll clean up my desk when Maya stops asking silly questions... No hurry then.) Maya: Hey! This calendar... Phoenix: What about it...? If this is another hint about tidying, you can forget it. Maya: Someone's marked December 3rd in red pen! Phoenix: December 3rd? That's the day Mr. Elg was murdered! Is there anything else? Maya: Yeah. Umm... It says, \"Meet with The Tiger.\" Phoenix: The T-Tiger? Glen's Calendar added to the Court Record. Horse calendar (subsequent times) Maya: Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess! Phoenix: Looks pretty average to me. Maya: But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this. Phoenix: You think? Real whiz-kids can work under any condition, you know. Maya: ...! Phoenix: (She's trying to hint that I should tidy my desk more. I'll clean up my desk when Maya stops asking silly questions... No hurry then.) Talk Blue Screens, Inc. Phoenix: So... What exactly is this firm's business? Basil: I will try to simplify it so that you can understand... We analyze the data management systems required by certain branches of industry... ...and deliver optimum operating system and source-level components. Maya: Huh? You lost me on the corner of Analyze and Management. Phoenix: It doesn't matter. They analyze stuff. You got that much, right? Basil: The software we produce is distributed on CDs. Maya: CDs...? Basil: Yes. Compact disc. Digital optical storage media. Phoenix: (Of course, CDs are used for software as well as music...) Basil: It is a small firm, but all of my employees are first-class programmers. Let's ask one of them what they are doing. Excuse me. What are you working on right now? Programmer: I'm researching the impact of time-slicing common areas in multi-threaded code on logical access to shared global variables. Obviously, program structure heavily influences response time and performance, so the co-independence of global variables and memory overheads is vitally important to the success of the execution. Basil: Well, you get the idea. This is the sort of thing we are involved in. Did you good people follow all of that? Maya: Y-Y-Yeah... Phoenix: (Your blank smile just said otherwise, Maya.) What happened Phoenix: You know about what happened, right, Ms. Basil? Basil: You mean about Glen being poisoned? Yes, I know. It's terrible. Maya: Can you tell us anything that might be helpful? Basil: I don't think so. A police officer was here earlier, too. But I couldn't tell him anything either, because... ...the waitress who committed the crime has nothing to do with Blue Screens, Inc. Maya: Oh... Phoenix: How about Mr. Elg's desk? Have you cleared it out already? Basil: No, not yet. It's the one, right in front of you. If there's anything that might be useful to you, you are welcome to take it. Phoenix: (I guess there might be a clue here somewhere...) Glen's troubles (appears after presenting Glen Elg profile) Phoenix: Um, about Mr. Elg... Was he in some kind of trouble? Basil: I'm sorry? Why would you think that? Phoenix: I thought you said something about it just now? You said he got himself into trouble because he was a bit of a \"loser\". Basil: ... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Three Psyche-Locks?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock?] in the original release) Maya: I guess Mr. Elg is like every other man with his pile of secrets. Glen's troubles (subsequent times) Phoenix: Please tell us more about the trouble that Mr. Elg was in. Basil: I'm sorry. I don't know anything about that. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Basil: I do not pry into other people's affairs. Maya: She just gave us the dreaded \"professional, business-like cold-shoulder\", huh? Phoenix: (I need to find out exactly what the victim was involved in. Looks like I've got to break her in a \"professional, business-like\" manner!) Present Glen Elg profile Phoenix: Um, about Mr. Elg... Basil: He was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. But he did suffer from one or two bugs in his personality. Maya: Oh? Like what? Basil: He was a bit of a \"loser\"... Perhaps that would be the best way to describe it. That's what got him into trouble... ... Maya: What's the matter? Basil: He was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. So he was really no trouble at all. A model employee. Phoenix: Hey, wait a minute! Just now you said something about him being in trouble! (We've got to find out what this trouble was exactly.) Anything else Maya: Umm, would you mind taking a look at this? Basil: I'm sorry. That data is SuPer-Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected. Maya: SuPer Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected!? What!? This is madness! Phoenix: No, Maya. That is SPARDA. She won't tell us unless we say the right code word. Maya: A code word? Hmm... ... Sesame! Basil: ... Maya: If it's not \"sesame\", then it must be her mother's maiden name. That's how it always is. Phoenix: There's no point in having a password if it's always the same thing, Maya. (I guess she just doesn't want to talk about this.) Maya: Maybe we should focus on asking about Glen Elg. What do you say? Trés Bien Present Lisa Basil profile Gumshoe: That lady is the boss of Blue Screens, Inc., pal. Yeah... I figure she's clean. She got nothing to hide. She seemed kinda like a doll to me. In a good way and a bad way. ... Kinda makes you think she might be hiding something. Trés Bien (after breaking Psyche-Lock, then clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien, and clearing \"Tender Lender\" Talk option in Trés Bien - Kitchen) Gumshoe: Well, I'm gonna head back to the precinct now. We've got a big meeting starting in a bit. Maya: About Maggey's case, you mean? Gumshoe: No, that's pretty much wrapped up now... There's another big case going down at the moment, so she's been pushed aside... Maya: OK. Well, see you later then. Gumshoe: Bye! Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... Phoenix: ......... Y-You better get going, Detective, or you'll be late. Gumshoe: Actually, I, um... I've kinda got a favor to ask. It's a big one! Phoenix: A favor? Gumshoe: Yeah... It's for, um... Maggey, actually. I was kinda hoping... you'd give this to her for me. Maya: What is it? Gumshoe: It's a lunchbox. I got up early so I could make it. I've been real worried about her. She looked like she'd lost a lot of weight. Maya: Detective Gumshoe... ... How many weenies are in here!? There's not a person on earth who could down this much meat. Gumshoe: You think? I love weenies. I can't get enough of their tender juiciness. So will you give to her? It took me ages to make, so please say you will, pal! Phoenix: (I can't exactly say no, can I?) Gumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya to carry. Maya: Maybe I'll eat it myself if I get hungry! Gumshoe: Don't forget, OK? I'm counting on you to give that to Maggey. Phoenix: (He's finally gone...) January 7Tender Lender Maya: ...This place gives off a really strange vibe, doesn't it? Phoenix: Looks like \"The Tiger\" isn't in his lair. (And that is, as they say, a very good thing.) ???: ...Welcome... Phoenix: *gulp* (Talk about a creepy voice! It makes your soul want to shrivel up and die!) ???: You're here... to discuss a loan...? Phoenix: Uh, no. Not exactly... ???: The manager is away at the moment... Wait quietly... please... Maya: She's gone! Just like that! Phoenix: I guess we'll just have to come back another time. Maya: But this is the perfect opportunity, Nick! This place reeks of suspicion! Come on, Nick! Let's take a look around, OK? Phoenix: Do you think it'd be OK...? Maya: Of course! No one will ever know... ???: ...Coffee...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll leave it here for you to enjoy... Quietly. Phoenix: Y-Yes! Thank you! ???: Do not touch the desk... Please... Maya: N-N-Nick! Let's g-get out of here! Phoenix: (NOW she wants to get out of here...) Examine Desk on rug Phoenix: That's one impressive desk on one impressive rug! Maya: It's solid gold, Nick! Gold! Just look at that shine! Only real gold shines like that. Phoenix: Would you really want such a shiny desk, though? Maya: I don't know, but let's see what it's like to sit at a solid gold desk... Wow! I'm completely dazzled! Phoenix: That's because it's completely dazzling! Maya: I can see up my nose in the reflection! That's gotta be really distracting! Phoenix: (So the desk isn't practical. No surprise there.) Punching bag Maya: What's this? Phoenix: It's a punching bag. Maya: What!? No way. You wouldn't catch me walking around with a bag like that! Phoenix: What do you mean, \"walking around\"? Maya: The design's gross to start with, and it's way too heavy to be practical. And why's it called a \"punching\"-bag? Don't people know messenger bags are in! I knew it. I was right before, back at Trés Bien. Paris fashion is more my thing. Phoenix: (I really, really hope she's pulling my chain on this one.) CD player Phoenix: There's a CD player on the desk. But the desk is so loud, it's a wonder you can hear it. Maya: The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into. ???: Have you finished... ...the coffee? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Y-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely. ???: ... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... *gulp* ???: ...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup... Phoenix: (Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!) Maya: Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast... Phoenix: I-I sure hope so... (We better take a look at that CD while we're still alive and have the chance...) What the...!? Maya: What!? It's not the Rocko soundtrack, is it? Claw of the Tiger? Phoenix: It's... It's a demo CD... The artist's name has been hand-written on the disc in pen. \"MC Bomber\"... Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (This must be the CD Maggey told us about!) Maya: Let's listen to it! I bet it's heavy metal! Phoenix: No way! That woman'll make us drink more coffee if we do! MC Bomber added to the Court Record. CD player (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a CD player on the desk. But the desk is so loud, it's a wonder you can hear it. Maya: The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into. ???: Have you finished... ...the coffee? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Y-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely. ???: ... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... *gulp* ???: ...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup... Phoenix: (Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!) Maya: Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast... Phoenix: I-I sure hope so... Items on bookshelf Maya: Let's see... This round doll thing is called a \"daruma\"... I think. I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering. Phoenix: You mean you aren't making stuff up for a change? Maya: Heh. I bet you also didn't know that no matter what, he'll always right himself. Go on, Nick! Give him a good shove! Phoenix: Only if I feel like dying! Maya: Now, this yellow thing... This is a Japanese chess piece. I think it's a \"king\"? Not that I'm an expert or anything... I'm more of a Reversi person, you know. Phoenix: (Assuming she knows what she's talking about, these aren't exactly your typical... ...\"mobster wannabe\" items. They're not... \"trophies\", are they...? *gulp*) Maya: Hey... There's a piece of paper sticking out from under here. Phoenix: What is it? ...A repair bill? (Looks like he did some repair work on his car... Does he even have one...?) $15,000 to replace a bumper and a light!? That's insane! Maya: The car's registered to... the \"Cadaverinis\"? Phoenix: Huh? So it's not even The Tiger's car? (Why would someone else's repair bill be in The Tiger's office...?) Repair Bill added to the Court Record. Items on bookshelf (subsequent times) Maya: Let's see... This round doll thing is called a \"daruma\"... I think. I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering. Phoenix: You mean you aren't making stuff up for a change?

Phoenix: (Assuming she knows what she's talking about, these aren't exactly your typical... ...\"mobster wannabe\" items. They're not... \"trophies\", are they...? *gulp*) Frame Phoenix: \"Win Through Compromise\"...? Maya: I wonder what that's supposed to mean... Phoenix: It must mean something if they took the trouble to frame it like that. Maya: Yeah well, it still doesn't make any sense to me... ???: ...That... Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: That's Tender Lender's guiding principle. Maya: Oh? ???: \"Compromise the customer to win.\" Maya: O-Oh, I see... How about you, Nick...? Phoenix: Yeah, umm... Well, as long as we don't have to compromise my hair, I'd say we're OK... (That's one slogan no business owner should ever explain to their customers... *shudder*) Spilled ashtray Maya: Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up. Phoenix: Yeah. It's all over the rug and everything. Maya: I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal. Phoenix: (How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?) Maya: Oh, hey! There's a book of matches here, too! Phoenix: Matches, huh? Places don't give those out much nowadays. ...Hey, wait a second! Maya: What is it? Phoenix: Look what's printed on its cover! It says, \"Trés Bien\"! (Changed from [Look what's printed on the back! It says, 'Trés Bien'!] in the original release) Trés Bien Matches added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (These matches could come in handy. We might be able to use them...) Maya: Yeah. The pilot light for the office boiler keeps going out. Phoenix: Swing and a miss, Maya. Swing and a miss. Spilled ashtray (subsequent times) Maya: Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up. Phoenix: Yeah. It's all over the rug and everything. Maya: I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal. Phoenix: (How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?) Hanging clothes Maya: Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic! Phoenix: (Looks more like a pimp coat to me... Guess I haven't got an eye for fashion.) Maya: Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick. Phoenix: Hmm... The same color as my suit...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Keep your voice down, Maya! Maya: N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this! ???: Some cake...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll just leave it here for you... Maya: Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks... ???: Just wait here quietly... Otherwise... Maya: S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said! Phoenix: Y-Yeah! Sure! ???: I have my eye on you... Only so I can \"take care of you\".... Understand...? Maya: Aah! I'm scared, Nick! Phoenix: ...So? What were you getting so excited about before? Maya: Look, on the lapel of this suit... Phoenix: That's...! That's an attorney's badge! Maya: Is The Tiger a lawyer!? Phoenix: No way! Look at this thing! It's made of paper! (Changed from [No way! Look at this badge! It's made of paper!] in the original release) Paper Badge added to the Court Record. Maya: For some reason, your badge suddenly looks really cheap to me, Nick. Phoenix: (Why doesn't anyone recognize an obviously fake badge when they see one...?) Hanging clothes (subsequent times) Maya: Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic! Phoenix: (Looks more like a pimp coat to me... Guess I haven't got an eye for fashion.) Maya: Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick. Phoenix: Hmm... The same color as my suit...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Keep your voice down, Maya! Maya: N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this! ???: Some cake...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll just leave it here for you... Maya: Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks... ???: Just wait here quietly... Otherwise... Maya: S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said! Phoenix: Y-Yeah! Sure! ???: I have my eye on you... Only so I can \"take care of you\".... Understand...? Maya: Aah! I'm scared, Nick! After examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes: ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Come out from under the desk, Maya!) The Tiger: Whad are youse two snoopin' around in my office for!? Phoenix: N-Nothing. W-We were just... The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! My precious carpet! Youse got ash on my rug! You' gonna wish your ugly feet never came through my door! Phoenix: I-It wasn't us! It was already like th-- The Tiger: Youse wanna argue with me!? Is that what you' doin'? You dink youse can take me on!? I'm gonna flatten youse two into pancakes and turn youse into my new rugs! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: ...Oh... Don Tigre... You're back... Phoenix: (Ack... That voice... It's like evil seeping into your head through your ears...) ???: ...I'm sorry... Don Tigre... I knocked over that ashtray before... and... Phoenix: (Eek! Has she got a death wish or what!?) The Tiger: ... Oh, right. Phoenix: Huh? The Tiger: F-Forget about it, Violetta. I-It's noddin'... Phoenix: (What, what, what!?) The Tiger: I ain't gonna get mad at you. You' too cute, you hear! Phoenix: (That's so unfair!) ???: Here... Have some cookies... I just baked them... And you'll need some strong espresso... while you're discussing your loan... The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: Y-Yes!? The Tiger: Youse either crazy or just plain stupid to chase after me! I worked so hard, but now youse gotta come and mess up my plan... Phoenix: (So it was him... He's my phony...) The Tiger: Heh, but I don't care. No one gets in my way! Phoenix: Wh-What? I mean, e-excuse me? The Tiger: Heh heh heh! Youse shoulda left de little girl at home, Wright. Phoenix: Um... I have a few things I want to ask-- The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! The Tiger: No questions! Dis is de last time we meet! Phoenix: Ack! Wait! P-Please! Maya: ...That was pretty weak, Nick. You waited until he was out of earshot before you shouted after him. Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk! I didn't hear you scream, \"Hold it!\" either!) ???: ...The espresso... Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: ...And cookies... Phoenix: (This woman is definitely not good for my heart. Now, what was it The Tiger called her...? \"Violetta\"?) Talk Tender Lender Phoenix: So... I'm kind of curious about your company, Tender Lender... Violetta: ...With the warm and friendly atmosphere you'd expect from a family-sized business... ...a conscientious rate of interest... and an attractive repayment policy... Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling this sentence is not going to end well...?) Violetta: ...we will tenderly lend you that little bit extra, here at Tender Lender. Maya: Hey, Nick. Things are a bit tight for Wright and Co. at the moment, aren't they? I mean there's that 500 dollars you owe me from our card game for starters. Why don't you take out a loan? Phoenix: (Would I like to take out a loan from a place like this? Not so much...) Violetta: Tender Lender is... on your side... Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: So, um, let's say I'm late with my repayment... What happens then? Violetta: ...We'd give you more coffee... ...Strong coffee... Phoenix: Um, right... I think I'd rather skip down! Maya: Hey! Just remember I can make strong coffee too, Nick! Strong tea, as well! What happened Phoenix: So, um, do you know about the incident we're investigating? Violetta: What incident...? Maya: Well, a man was poisoned in a restaurant just near here. That incident. Violetta: Let me see... I was here that day, with the manager... Phoenix: The manager being The Tiger...? Violetta: ...Furio Tigre... Maya: F-Furio... Phoenix: ...T-Tigre? (So that's where the \"Tiger\" thing comes from...) Maya: Xin Eohp's got a real name! Nick! Hurry up and find out more about him! Saved your life? (appears after presenting Furio Tigre profile) Violetta: I'm very... frail, you see... Just recently, I... died... Once... Hee... Hee... Maya: You d-died!? Violetta: About 4 months ago... The doctors said to... abandon all hope... Phoenix: (I guess they were expecting her to take a boat ride across the River Styx.) Violetta: But Don Tigre... He saved me. He gave up everything... Maya: Everything!? Violetta: When I found out what he had done for me, I... was happy... Maya: No offense, but I'm finding that a little hard to believe. Violetta: I decided I'd pay him back... with my life... by serving him coffee... and espresso... Phoenix: (I still wonder about what's in her coffee...) So... is that why you've got that bandage around your head? Violetta: Hee... Hee... Hee... This? The head bandage (appears after \"Saved your life?\") Phoenix: Um, so what's the story with the bandage? Violetta: ... They put it on after the operation... Maya: Operation? Violetta: It's just a little injury... A little, fatal, injury... Hee... Hee... Hee... Maya: A f-f-fatal injury!? Phoenix: (Maya just suffered one herself, by the sound of it...) So, that's the injury you were talking about before when you said you had died once? Violetta: ... 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: ...! Maya: Urgh! She really creeps me out, Nick! Phoenix: (Same here. But we've got to find out the truth!) The head bandage (subsequent times) Violetta: It was very complicated... The operation... They opened up my head... And performed surgery on my frontal lobe... Maya: Urgh! Just thinking about it sends shivers down my spine! Phoenix: So how did you get this \"fatal injury\" that left you needing an operation? 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Violetta: I made a promise to Don Tigre... I said I would never tell... Cross my heart and hope to drink 100 cups of espresso... Phoenix: Oh. (That much caffeine would raise anyone from the dead!) Violetta: Besides... It's a very precious memory to me... Phoenix: A... A precious memory...? (I'll never find out what she means if I can't break her...) Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Can I ask you about The Tiger, I mean, Mr. Tigre? Violetta: ...Cookie...? Maya: S-Sure...? Violetta: How do you like my cookies? I baked them myself... Hee... Hee... Hee... Maya: Go ahead, Nick! The honor is all yours! Phoenix: No, no! Ladies first, Maya! Violetta: Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: (No matter how I look at this, I just don't get it... What are The Tiger and this scary girl doing working together?) Violetta: We... are lovers... Phoenix: (That's not exactly coming across in your tone of voice...) Violetta: And I owe Don Tigre my life... He's the one who saved me... Phoenix: The Tiger... saved you...!? Violetta: Please, address him properly as \"Don Tigre\". Otherwise, I'll have to... Phoenix: OK, OK! Don Tigre! Of course! I'm sorry. (He saved her life? I'd sure like to how that happened.) Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Violetta: More coffee...? You must have more... Phoenix: No! Um, thanks! I've had enough. Really! (I'm so thirsty!) Violetta: I don't leave the office... I can't tell you about anything... except Don Tigre. January 7Vitamin Square Maya: There he is! Old Seedy's back feeding the pigeons again! Kudo: There! Take this! And this! And get out of my park! Phoenix: Like I thought, he's really mad... Come on, Maya. Just keep your head down and let's sneak away while we still can... Maya: What? Why? Hellooo, old man! Phoenix: What are you doing, Maya!? Kudo: Huh!? ...Kah! Maya: Hey, he just turned his back on us! Phoenix: I'm not surprised. I bet I really hurt his pride in court this morning. Maya: Hey, Mr. Kudo! Kudo: Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Hmm, pi-pi-pigeon, hmm... Kah! Maya: Look, we really need to talk to you, alright? Kudo: Out with the demons! In with good fortune! Maya: Ow! Ow! Ow! Seeds... Shell splinters... Painful... Phoenix: I always knew you were a demon, Maya! Talk Today's trial Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry about what happened in court earlier today. Kudo: Kah! Everyone'll be talking about me behind my back now! A dirty old man who was so busy looking at the serving girl's backside... ...that he can't remember her face! A filthy, depraved animal! Phoenix: N-Not at all! Kudo: Are you listening to me, boy!? I don't care what you say, I saw that waitress put it in! She put some white powder into the young lad's javaccino! Maya: We hear you... Kudo: And another thing! The young layabout was wearing an earpiece! On the same side as the lens of his broken spectacles! Maya: W-We're really sorry... Kudo: So I made a little mistake about the vase. So what!? I know what I saw! I tell you, I tell you, I tell you! Phoenix: OK, OK! Take it easy, please, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Don't tell me to take it easy, you spikey-haired brat! Take this! Embroiderer Maya: Um... You said you were a craftsman, right? Kudo: Kah! The modern world casts honest craftsmen like me aside in droves! Maya: S-Surely it's not that... Kudo: I come from a long line of craftsmen. Right back to the time of the shoguns! Do you hear me!? I didn't become an embroiderer, I was BORN one! Maya: Actually... I'm kind of in the same situation myself. Kudo: I... I... I wanted to stick my fingers up that dribbling old judge's nose... ...and scream right down his earhole... \"Objection!\" Maya: Oh... So, did you want to become a lawyer when you were young...? Phoenix: I don't think that's quite it, Maya. I think he's just in a bad mood, that's all... Kudo: I've got a tsunami of frustration inside and it's ready to burst out! Phoenix: (If we let him start rambling now, we might never shut him up! What should I do?) Cut in Phoenix: Um, actually, we've got places to go, things to check and stuff... Maybe another time? Kudo: Fine! Whatever! Just don't forget! I've got a tsunami's worth of grumbling to do. Phoenix: Yes, yes. This girl right here is really looking forward to hearing it all. Honest! Maya: What!? I never said that! Kudo: Come to the place where I work, then. Here. Bring this along with you. Phoenix: (What is this? It's covered in seeds... A discount coupon for a burger!?) Maya: He really wants someone to grumble at, huh? ...Although, it IS a burger joint... Leads back to Talk options Suck it up Phoenix: (Guess I better let him talk...) So, there's not much call for craftsmen these days, then? Kudo: Of course not, you idiot! All I'm good for nowadays is running errands! Maya: Errands? Kudo: Everyone takes advantage of the elderly! \"Buy some bread, gramps!\" \"Take the dog for a walk, granddad!\" \"Feed the pigeons, old man!\" What am I? Some sort of two-bit community handyman!? Maya: Um, well... Kudo: \"Buy some bread\", now that I can understand. But what's the point of feeding some seedy pigeons!? Why don't people say what they mean!? \"Get lost!\" That's what they're trying to say! Oh, yes! I'm just an inconvenience, you see! At home... At that restaurant... I just get in the way, don't I!? Phoenix: I-I'm sure you don't. (Wait a minute! What did he just say? At home and... at that restaurant?) Hold up... By \"restaurant\", are you talking about Trés Bien? Did you get asked to run an errand there, too? Kudo: Yes, I did! The very day that young brat was poisoned. Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? Leads back to Talk options The \"errand\" (appears after selecting \"Suck it up\" upon selecting \"Embroiderer\" Talk option) Phoenix: So on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do? Kudo: Glad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me. Armstrong: \"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!\" Kudo: \"Call them yourself!\" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time. Maya: So, did you end up calling the police? Kudo: Like I said, I was in a bit of a daze. Phoenix: Did you call them on your cell phone? Kudo: Kah! Do I look like I'd have one of those new-fangled thingamajigs? I went out looking for a pay phone, of course! Maya: You went looking for one...? Kudo: I couldn't find one right away, you know. Wandered around for 5 minutes or so. Maya: F-Five minutes...? Phoenix: So for five minutes after the incident happened... Kudo: Yessiree, the owner was at Trés Bien on his own. Phoenix: Why didn't you mention this in court this morning? Kudo: Well, I would have if you'd given me the chance! But you all bullied me out of the courtroom! Judge: *sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today. Kudo: WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else... Judge: Bailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom! Kudo: It's not my fault! You're the ones to blame! Phoenix: You could have at least told us before we got to court. Maya: Is it really that important that Mr. Kudo was the one who called the police...? Phoenix: (What's important is the unaccounted time before the police arrived. The victim was dead, and Maggey was unconscious. Which leaves that woman... I mean, that man, alone in the restaurant!) Mr. Kudo might have been chased out of the place on purpose. Maya: What do you mean? Phoenix: Maybe a certain someone didn't want him in the restaurant. Maya: Ah! Kudo: Oh, sure! You go ahead and say I was in the way as usual! I suppose I should've been getting myself covered in pigeon poop instead, hmm? Phoenix: (We need to get more details about what exactly happened... ...from Maggey... and from Mr. Armstrong!) The \"errand\" (subsequent times) Phoenix: So on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do? Kudo: Glad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me. Armstrong: \"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!\" Kudo: \"Call them yourself!\" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time.

Wandered around for 5 minutes or so. Maya: F-Five minutes...? Phoenix: So for five minutes after the incident happened... Kudo: Yessiree, the owner was at Trés Bien on his own. Present Anything Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this? Kudo: ... Kah! Phoenix: Excuse me... Kudo: You let me get a million of my grumbles off my chest, and I'll take one quick look. I've got an earthquake of frustration inside and it's ready to rumble! Phoenix: ...On second thought, forget it. A million grumbles for one quick look doesn't sound like a good deal... for me. After clearing \"The \"errand\"\" Talk option in Vitamin Square: January 7Trés BienKitchen Maya: Looks like Mr. Armstrong's out again. Phoenix: But the place is open for business... You can't have an open restaurant without a chef! Maya: Hey! It's not my fault, Nick! Don't take it out on me! Phoenix: (Only a couple of minutes after the incident happened... Mr. Kudo left the scene, leaving Mr. Armstrong here alone.) Maya: Argh... Missing when we need to talk to him the most. Phoenix: (Maybe he's trying to avoid us on purpose?) After breaking Psyche-Lock, clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien: January 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room Byrde: Oh, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Hello, Maggey. So they finished questioning you? Byrde: Wasn't it just unbelievable in court today, sir!? I'm going to stay up all night and blog about everything that happened! Maya: Weren't you scared? It was pretty touch and go in there. Byrde: Yeah, but you totally nailed that old man! Phoenix: Well, he was all over the place with his testimony. Byrde: He's not the only one! Maya: Huh? What do you mean? Byrde: Everyone else's testimonies don't match up either. Not with what I remember of the incident, anyway... Phoenix: (Is it possible she is the one misremembering things...?) Talk Contradictions Maya: Maggey... You know how you said that everyone else... ...provided testimony that didn't match up with what you remembered? Byrde: Yup. There are just so many things that don't seem to add up. The biggest contradiction is the other guy I saw at the victim's table. HE was the one who slipped something into the victim's coffee. I'm sure it was him! Phoenix: (But didn't Mr. Kudo testify earlier today... ...that it was the waitress who put some white powder into the coffee cup...?) Maya: So you really think it was this \"disappearing man\" that did it...? Byrde: Well, he's not the only thing that disappeared. The CD vanished as well. You know, the CD with the writing on it. Maya: Oh, yeah. The \"MC Screwdriver\" album, right? Phoenix: It was \"MC Bomber\", Maya. That name was scrawled on the sports paper as well. Byrde: They never did find that CD at the crime scene, sir. Phoenix: (Or the victim's medication. That's gone missing, too.) Maya: Ouch, my head... This is getting way too complicated for me! After the incident Phoenix: You said that you passed out when the victim, Glen Elg, collapsed, right? Byrde: Yes. It's so embarrassing. I mean, I used to be a cop! When I came to, the restaurant was buzzing with police. And before I knew what was going on, they arrested me, sir. Phoenix: So between the time the victim collapsed and the time the police arrived on the scene... ...you have no idea what went on at Trés Bien. Byrde: No. No idea at all. Why? Is it important, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The other witness, the old man from the park, was pretty much chased out of the picture. Byrde: \"Chased out of the picture\"? What do you mean? Maya: Old Seedy wasn't inside the restaurant because he was told to go call the police. Phoenix: Exactly. And you, Maggey, were unconscious. That means Mr. Armstrong was alone in the restaurant for a brief period of time. Byrde: No... Y-You don't think Mr. Armstrong... set me up... do you? Phoenix: When you consider the facts... ...it's hard to imagine that Mr. Armstrong isn't involved in this at all. Byrde: Grr! It's like the master biting the paw of the dog that it feeds! Are you sure about this, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Well, the old man said as much when we spoke with him earlier. Byrde: I don't know. The things that man says don't add up for some reason, sir... Phoenix: (Maggey looks like she's trying to figure something out...) Maya: We'd better find outexactly what happened to the old man on that day. Victor's testimony (appears after presenting Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile) Phoenix: Is there anything about Mr. Kudo's testimony that stood out as odd to you? Byrde: Actually... Yes. The fact that he was even testifying to begin with doesn't quite... Maya: ...? \"Doesn't quite\" what? Byrde: Well, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant. Phoenix: (Yeah, we know that already. It was Victor Kudo.) Byrde: But I can't really say it was an old man. Maya: OK, then how about calling him a really old middle-aged man! Byrde: No, age isn't the issue. The other customer was a woman. Phoenix: A woman!? Maya: Are you sure, Maggey!? Byrde: Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I think so. Maya: So? What did this woman look like? Byrde: Umm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh. Phoenix: \"Creepy\"? Maya: \"Cackling\"? Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling I've come across a woman like that recently?) Present Sports Paper Byrde: That's the paper the victim had with him, isn't it? Maya: That's what we think, madam. Byrde: I kind of remember him having a paper, actually. And I remember something about this \"MC Bomber\", too. Maya: It was written on the CD that disappeared as well, wasn't it? Byrde: I don't suppose it makes any difference if there was one CD or two, right? Magazine Clipping Byrde: Just thinking about the trial that day gives me the creeps. Maya: Was it that bad? Phoenix: D-Don't forget that was my phony, not me! Byrde: He was supposed to say, \"Surely the defendant isn't the real criminal!\" But instead he shouted out, \"Surely the defendant is the real criminal!\" ...By mistake. Maya: Oh, ouch. Phoenix: L-Like I said, that was my phony, not me! Byrde: I...! I don't want to think about it anymore... Phoenix: (Trust me, neither do I...) Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile Byrde: Ah, I feel much better after the trial this morning. I've been a bit of a courtroom proceedings addict for years now. It feels like forever since I was a witness as slippery as that old man. Maya: He's not really that bad of an old man though. Byrde: Still, I feel a bit uneasy. Maya: Huh? I thought you just said you felt much better... Phoenix: Maggey. If there's something on your mind, you've got to tell us. Especially if it has anything to do with Mr. Kudo or his testimony. Byrde: Roger! I'll spill it all and see what you make of it! Coffee Cup Byrde: That's the cup I took over to the table, sir. But! I didn't put anything in it... I just... I could never do something like that! Maya: That's right! You could never do anything like that! Byrde: I'm not good at carrying those large trays, you know. Trying to balance a tray with one hand to put something in the coffee with the other... That'd just be asking for trouble. I'd drop something, for sure! Maya: Th-That's right! Phoenix: (...I-Is she expecting me to claim that she's too clumsy to have committed the crime...?) Apron Byrde: Oh, yeah. That's from when I was carrying a customer's breakfast over to them. Phoenix: The ketchup splotch, you mean? Byrde: My whole face was fire-engine red, thanks to that stuff. Maya: But you spilled the ketchup in your apron, didn't you? I don't see how... Byrde: The ketchup-covered omelet went flying and hit the customer in the face. Maya: Oh, talk about a tomato-red face! Makes me wish I could've seen it myself. Byrde: Yeah, I guess... It was kind of a sight to behold. Potassium Cyanide Byrde: Potassium cyanide? I've never heard of that poison before in my life, sir! Phoenix: ... Byrde: OK, maybe I have. But I've never seen it before. That's the truth. I wouldn't even know where the nearest potassium cyanide dealer is in the first place. Maya: Potassium cyanide dealers? Sounds like another group of drug pushers to avoid... Phoenix: In any case, this definitely isn't something you can pick up just anywhere. Byrde: Ooh!! Curse my rotten luck! The criminal must've stuck the bottle in my apron while I was unconscious! Gumshoe's Lunchbox Phoenix: Oh, yeah! I've got something you're going to love! Byrde: Really? What is it!? Phoenix: A lunchbox, just for you. Here! Byrde: Wow! A lunchbox! Weenies, too! I can't believe it! Thank you, sir! Did you make this just for me, Mr. Wright? Maya: Nah, it was Detective Gumshoe! Who else would make such a nice lunchbox for you? Byrde: Detective Gumshoe? Maya: He's really worried about you. Looks like he put a lot of effort into making this, too! Byrde: ... I can't accept it. Detention Center rules. No gifts allowed, sir. Phoenix: Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't be like that. Byrde: The rules are the rules! They'll lock you up if you break them. Phoenix: (Somehow, when an ex-cop turned waitress says that, it seems a whole lot scarier.) Byrde: And anyway... I hate weenies! Maya: O-Oh... really? Byrde: It's all yours, Maya! You can enjoy it with Mr. Wright! Maya: B-But... Phoenix: ... She's right... It's better than letting it go to waste. Maya: But! ...I guess so. Gumshoe's Lunchbox eaten with Maya. Byrde: ... Well? How was it? Phoenix: That hit the spot! I love weenies. Byrde: Oh, good! I'm glad I gave it to you, then, sir! Paper Badge Byrde: Ah! Is that... your attorney's badge? Phoenix: Actually, it's a fake. Byrde: Hoooly smokes! That's it!! Maya: Huh? Byrde: That's the badge your phony had, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: You got duped by this...!? Maya: But it's a completely different color! Phoenix: And what about the fact that it's made of paper!? Byrde: He said the badge got a tan as well, while he was in Hawaii on business. Phoenix: (I'm beginning to see how my phony was able to gain her trust...) Glen Elg profile Byrde: Ah! That's the victim, isn't it? Phoenix: That day was the first time you'd ever seen this man, right? Byrde: Yes. I'd never met or seen him before then. I just happened to be the waitress who served him his coffee, sir. That's all! Phoenix: It seems he was a computer programmer. Byrde: Really? I'm useless with computers. Completely hopeless. I don't know any computer programs. Phoenix: (Did she mean \"programmers\"?) Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Back when I was an officer, Detective Gumshoe always looked out for me. But today! Today I was the one who had to look out for him; trying to incriminate me the whole time! Phoenix: You've got to remember, Maggey. Gumshoe's a detective. He's got a job to do. Byrde: My old boss... I thought at least he'd be on my side. Maya: He is on your side! He'd do anything to help y-- Byrde: You can't fool me! I saw him in court today! I felt like a poor little baby woodpecker being pecked on the head by its own mother! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's testimony was pretty solid... No wonder it hurt her so much.) Byrde: I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again! Phoenix: (Ouch. I think I just saw Gumshoe's chances go down in flames like the Hindenburg...) Maya: I don't think it's getting through to her that he really was trying to help... Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Mr. Armstrong was very good to me after I was fired from the force. I can't believe someone as nice as him could have anything to do with this... Phoenix: (Well, in the time between the victim being poisoned and the police being called... ...the only person who was on the scene and had a chance to do anything... ...was Mr. Armstrong. There was no one else there.) Byrde: M-Mr. Armstrong wouldn't... He wouldn't set me up... would he!? Furio Tigre profile Byrde: Hoooly smokes! That's him!! Maya: Huh? Byrde: That's your phony, Mr. Wright! Just look at that ridiculous suntan! Phoenix: Um... For the record, I'm not sunburned like an over-dried tomato so I don't know... Byrde: He told me he'd been on a business trip to Hawaii and that's where he got the tan. Phoenix: (I'm not hearing this...) Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be in the police force. But I'm incarcerated, now. I don't pick up much information in here. All I can help you out with now is the menu at Trés Bien. Maya: Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't let your spirits fall! After examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes in Tender Lender, and clearing \"Victor's testimony\" Talk option and presenting Gumshoe's Lunchbox in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Detective: The main server just went up in smoke! Why the heck isn't the press conference set up yet!? The Superintendent's here already! Chief: Yeah. And there's a problem with the Internet, too. Detective: I already told you to stop using your computer, Chief! Chief: But I'm watching videos online! I'm catching up on my Asian soap operas! Detective: It's gonna have to wait, Chief. I'm throwing the switch! Chief: Nooo! Just when Sum Yung-Gai was about to confess to his son's hot-to-trot girlfriend! Maya: Wow! This place is really buzzing. Phoenix: Something must be going down. Something really big. Gumshoe: Huh!? What are you doing here, pal? Maya: Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: You can't be here right now. You'll be roped into the briefing if you stay. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: We've got big problems here today. Maya: Why? What's going on? Gumshoe: It's a virus! A virus!! Phoenix: (A virus?) Gumshoe: There's a virus ripping through the precinct's computer system. Phoenix: (But I really need to ask you some questions...) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Your batteries won't last forever. Remember that when you're having fun... in bed.\" We have a winner! A little joke to make people think about their smoke alarms. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a fire safety campaign... ...I guess? ...Does he even know what he's trying to get across anymore? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut. Chief: Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to read the paper now. Phoenix: (Alternately, you could read some reports... Just a suggestion.) Chief: What the heck is this!? This paper's more than a month old! And someone's written all over it! Who's the clown that put this on my desk? Well? Speak up! Maya: He just wadded it up and chucked it in the trash! Phoenix: But that's an important piece of evidence! Talk Tender Lender Gumshoe: OK, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up! Maya: Y-Yes! Gumshoe: No matter how poor you get, never borrow money from a place like this, you hear? Maya: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: If you got money trouble, just go on a diet of instant noodles and hang in there! Phoenix: Ah, we're not thinking about borrowing money, Detective! We want information. Gumshoe: Oh... Is that all? Well, let's see... Tender Lender is considered to be even fishier than the average illegal loan shark. And it seems it ran into trouble just recently. Those guys have been pretty heavy-handed, calling in all their debts. Maya: Really? Gumshoe: Don't go poking your nose around in their business, pal. You'll really regret it if you upset that lady. Phoenix: Alright, I get the picture. (Hey, wait a minute! What did he just say!? \"That lady\"?) Maya: Who's this lady he's talking about, Nick? Phoenix: (We better find out what the story is with this \"lady\"...) Computer viruses Maya: So what exactly is a computer virus, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I dunno. Maya: What? Gumshoe: Look, I just go with the flow, alright, pal? Phoenix: (And here I thought detectives were supposed to be somewhat knowledgeable...) Gumshoe: What's with that face, pal? You think you know what a virus is? Maya: Well, Nick? Do you? Phoenix: A computer virus? Sure. I mean, only in simple terms, of course. Maya: Really? Wow, you know everything. Professor Nick! Gumshoe: Yeah. I'm gonna call you Dr. Wright from now on! Maya: Hey, that sounds pretty cool! Don't you agree, Dr. Wright? Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling they're making fun of me?) OK, fine. I'm no expert, but I can at least explain the basics to the two of you. What's a virus? (appears after \"Computer viruses\") Phoenix: A virus is a program that gets inside a computer and causes damage. Gumshoe: Damage? You mean it makes the machine go \"boom\" and explode? Phoenix: No. The damage is, um... Well, it's all internal. Maya: So the inside goes \"boom\", right? Phoenix: Imagine all the case data you've got stored on your PCs here in the station... A virus could wipe out all that. That's the kind of damage I'm talking about. Maya: Whoa! That's scary. Phoenix: Yeah. And what's even more scary is that viruses are infectious. Maya: Infectious? Phoenix: Most computers are connected together on a network, right? A virus can move on machine to another over the network. So the virus just keeps spreading faster and faster. Gumshoe: Hmph. Just like a real virus, huh. Maya: But, Nick! Why would anyone want to make a program like that? Gumshoe: Yeah. It takes ages to type in all that data. Why would you wanna destroy it, pal? Phoenix: No. People don't infect their own machines. They send the virus to someone else's. Maya: What!? That's horrible! Gumshoe: Oh, I get it... It's like you sneezing on Godot so he catches a cold. Maya: Right! Then he wouldn't be able to turn up in court because he'd be too sick. You really shouldn't do stuff like that, Nick. It's wrong. Phoenix: Who? What? Where? When and why did the conversation jump to talking about me!? Anyway, that's what a computer virus is. A bad program that causes damage. Gumshoe: And all the different viruses have names, right? I kinda feel like I've heard the name of the virus we caught somewhere before. Phoenix: (The name of the virus, huh? I feel like I've heard of it before, too...) MC Bomber (appears after presenting Sports Paper or MC Bomber) Gumshoe: We already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met. Maya: Who are they? Gumshoe: I dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess. Phoenix: And now the virus has been released, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival! Maya: All this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie! Gumshoe: Apparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market. Phoenix: You mean someone put this virus up for sale? Gumshoe: Yeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal. Phoenix: (In the millions!? A virus can be worth that much!?) MC Bomber updated in the Court Record. MC Bomber (subsequent times) Gumshoe: We already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met. Maya: Who are they? Gumshoe: I dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess. Phoenix: And now the virus has been released, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival! Maya: All this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie! Gumshoe: Apparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market. Phoenix: You mean someone put this virus up for sale? Gumshoe: Yeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal. Phoenix: (In the millions!? A virus can be worth that much!?) The Cadaverinis (appears after presenting Violetta profile) Phoenix: I'm not sure if I really want to get involved in this, but who are the Cadaverinis? Gumshoe: Who are they? A scary bunch of people, that's who! Phoenix: (You're a cop, and you're scared? What's that about?) Gumshoe: Trust me, it doesn't matter if you're kid or a cop, these guys are scary. They've got some serious clout in the criminal underworld. We can't touch them. They've got too much moola. Phoenix: Moola...? As in? Gumshoe: They pretty much control all the cash on the city's black market. Phoenix: The black market, huh? And that includes Tender Lender, I take it? Gumshoe: Sure. No one stands up to Bruto Cadaverini. And I mean, no one! Phoenix: (Interesting...) Maya: So Viola's the granddaughter of some mafia boss then? Gumshoe: Yeah. And everyone know how much Bruto loves his little girl. She means everything to him. Phoenix: So... How did she end up at Tender Lender? Gumshoe: I dunno, pal. But I heard she and the boss of the Tender Lender are pretty tight. Maya: Tight? Gumshoe: That's what it said in a file I read related to Maggey's case. Phoenix: (Sounds like a pretty important clue.) Present Sports Paper or MC Bomber Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, umm... about this... Gumshoe: What!? I'm trying to concentrate on Maggey and this virus right now, so I... Aaaaaaaaaaah!! This is it! This stupid name! I remember now! Phoenix: (I thought so. Here it comes...) Maya: Don't just nod to yourself and keep me in the dark, Nick! What's going on!? Phoenix: It's OK, Maya! You don't have to cry about it! Gumshoe: The name scribbled on that sports paper and written on that CD... That's the name of the virus! \"MC Bomber\"! Maya: WHAT!? Gumshoe: Yeah! The virus that's just infected every computer in the station, pal. It's MC Bomber! Phoenix: Can you give us any more details? Please? Glen Elg profile Gumshoe: This guy was a real programming genius. They called him \"the walking computer\" at the place where he worked. Maya: What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!? Phoenix: (*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!) Gumshoe: Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim. Violetta profile Gumshoe: That's the girl who works over at Tender Lender. You wanna stay away from her, OK? I mean it. Maya: She does look kind of unforgiving, doesn't she? Gumshoe: That should be the least of your worries, pal. Phoenix: (What's that supposed to mean? What could be worse...?) Gumshoe: Her name's Viola Cadaverini. She's the only granddaughter of Bruto Cadaverini. Maya: Bruto Cadaverini? Do you know who that is, Nick? Phoenix: Never heard of him. Gumshoe: Bruto Cadaverini's the boss of the Cadaverini family. Phoenix: The Cadaverinis? (That's one scary-sounding name!) Gumshoe: We can't touch them. They're way too powerful for the police. But you're thinking of taking them on, aren't you? Phoenix: N-No! I don't remember ever saying I was going to! (I better get some more info out of Gumshoe about this \"family\"...) Furio Tigre profile Gumshoe: Oh, this guy... The Tiger... Maya: Is he famous? Gumshoe: Yeah. This guy's not a loan shark, you know. Nope. He's a big loan cat! Phoenix: Hence the name? Gumshoe: Don't pay him back, and you'd better say your prayers, because he'll eat you alive. Maya: You're shaking, Detective. Phoenix: Like a leaf... Gumshoe: I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean. Bruto Cadaverini profile Gumshoe: I wouldn't go flashing that photo around if I were you, pal. Maya: Why not? Gumshoe: That guy rules the criminal underworld. You could get yourselves in serious trouble. I'm talking say-your-prayers trouble. Maya: You're shaking, Detective. Phoenix: Like a leaf... Gumshoe: I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean. After clearing \"MC Bomber\" and \"The Cadaverinis\" Talk options: Gumshoe: Aaaaargh! I can't believe it! I almost forgot the most important thing! Phoenix: A-And that is...? Gumshoe: You know, the lunchbox! How did everything go!? Phoenix: L-Lunchbox? Maya: You remember. The weenies...? Byrde: I hate weenies! Phoenix: (Oh, yeah... Those weenies.) Gumshoe: So? How did my weenies taste when they went down the hatch? Maya: Huh? Um... Well... It was... delicious! Gumshoe: Yeah? That's what she said? Really!? Maya: Umm... Well... Not exactly... Gumshoe: Don't worry about it, pal. I figured something would happen, so I came prepared. Phoenix: Prepared? What do you mean...? Gumshoe: I made a jumbo lunchbox! Maya: Oh... Gumshoe: Do me a favor again, huh, pal, and deliver this? Phoenix: (This sure is a heavy burden... In more ways than one...) Gumshoe: I can just imagine Maggey's little eyes sparkling with joy when you bring her that! Maya: ...Weenies, again, Nick? Tell me we don't have to eat all these too... Gumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya. Again. Maya: I really can't eat any more... Present Gumshoe's Lunchbox Gumshoe: Don't forget to give that to Maggey, OK? Maya: But they don't allow presents for the prisoners in the detention center, right...? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right... ... Well it doesn't matter. I'm counting on you to get it to her somehow. Phoenix: (I'm a lawyer, not a delivery boy, Gumshoe...) Blue Screens, Inc. Talk Glen's troubles (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Basil: Glen's head had more processing power than any computer. But it had been infected with a \"gambling\" virus. Glen was... in too deep. Phoenix: You mean he was in debt? Basil: Yes. 100,000 dollars in debt. Not an easy amount to repay. So... He said he was taking on some extra work. Something a bit risky. Phoenix: \"Risky\"? How? Maya: Maybe he was going to become a waitress at Trés Bien!? Phoenix: (Where do you come up with these ideas!?) Risky extra work (appears after \"Glen's troubles\") Phoenix: So it's safe to say Mr. Elg was the creator of this virus, huh? Basil: The \"MC Bomber\" virus? Yes. It was a work of genius. In a bad sort of way, of course. But still genius. Something like that would probably fetch several million dollars on the black market. Phoenix: (Inconceivable! Gumshoe was right for a change!) This date, December 3rd, that is marked on his calendar... That was his deadline for repaying his debts. MC Bomber updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: (I guess we won't be needing these horse racing tickets any more.) Glen Elg's Losing Horse Racing Tickets thrown back on the floor. Maya: Use the trash can, Nick! Risky extra work (subsequent times) Phoenix: So it's safe to say Mr. Elg was the creator of this virus, huh? Basil: The \"MC Bomber\" virus? Yes. It was a work of genius. In a bad sort of way, of course. But still genius. Something like that would probably fetch several million dollars on the black market. Phoenix: (Inconceivable! Gumshoe was right for a change!) This date, December 3rd, that is marked on his calendar... That was his deadline for repaying his debts. Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Glen's Trouble -- Phoenix: So, how about you tell me what kind of trouble Mr. Elg was in? Basil: I'm sorry, sir, but we don't deal with trouble-shooting here. Perhaps you'd like to speak to someone in customer service? Phoenix: (What's she talking about!? I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...) Ms. Basil. Let me ask you something. Did Mr. Elg's troubles have something to do with this? Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Basil: What is that? Phoenix: A lottery ticket. There were a ton of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime. (Changed from [There were hundreds of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime.] in the original release) Basil: And what is the relevance of that? Phoenix: The victim, Mr. Glen Elg... ...had a gambling habit, didn't he? Basil: I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone dreams of being rich. Even I listen to Millionaire Radio. Phoenix: (She's right. That is a bit weak on its own.) But Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to the lottery, was it? Present Losing Horse Racing Tickets Phoenix: Leads to: \"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: Everyone likes to gamble from time to time. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: But be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc. Phoenix: (Looks like I got that one wrong.) Leads back to: \"I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts.\" Present Losing Horse Racing Tickets Phoenix: Basil: What is that? Phoenix: A bunch of horse racing tickets. All losing ones. Basil: With that many tickets, you could get 1 dollar at the recycling center. You good people are very, very bad. Cashing in on others' misfortunes is immoral. Phoenix: (...Is that a whiff of hypocrisy I smell?) (Changed from [...Why did I get a whiff of hypocrisy just now?] in the original release) Basil: But what is the relevance of these tickets? Phoenix: The victim, Mr. Glen Elg... He had a gambling habit, didn't he? Basil: I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone likes to go to the races from time to time. Phoenix: (Yeah, but not everyone buys this many tickets!) Basil: Anyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own. Phoenix: You're right. But I'm not through yet. Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to horse races, was it? Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: Everyone likes to gamble from time to time. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: But be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc. Phoenix: (Looks like I got that one wrong.) Leads back to: \"Anyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!? Basil: I'm not sure. Let's ask one of the programmers... Excuse me. Can you answer this man's query, please? Programmer: The data queue that manages system tasks for trouble-shooting requires that the multi-tasking simulation for local variables be put into sleep mode so that data transmission on active nodes can be bundled correctly according to the source code. ...Obviously. Basil: So I'm afraid that is the situation, you see. Did you good people follow all that? Phoenix: Not even slightly! What was all that mumbo-jumbo? Basil: It is exactly as my programmer explained. Phoenix: (I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.) Basil: Would you like to input another question? Leads back to: \"I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...\" Phoenix: The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times. That's got to have hurt his wallet pretty bad, don't you think? Maybe bad enough to be the cause of some pretty serious trouble perhaps!? Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Basil: You are right. Glen did have a gambling habit. You good people must not follow his example, do you understand? Phoenix: Trust me. Even if I wanted to, I don't exactly have the money to buy any. Basil: But... if you win, there's no problem, is there? And Glen had a winning ticket, didn't he? For half a million dollars? Phoenix: Yeah, but... Basil: It's hard to imagine how he could have been in trouble then, isn't it? Phoenix: It's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end. But that was his first stroke of good luck. He was in deep trouble before that. Basil: Deep trouble? What do you mean? Phoenix: Mr. Elg's real problem was with someone or something more terrifying and ferocious! Present Glen's Calendar Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Elg met with someone on the day he was killed. He even made a note on this calendar about the meeting: \"Meet with The Tiger.\" Basil: What is the relevance of that? Are you trying to suggest Glen was meeting him to discuss his debt? Phoenix: Y-Yeah. That's what I was thinking. Basil: But I have never heard anything about this \"Tiger\" before. Maybe he's not even human. Maybe he really is a tiger! Phoenix: (I'm no programmer, but does she really expect me to buy such messed up logic?) In that case, I think it's time to introduce you to The Tiger. Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\".\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well?

Basil: \"Tender Lender\"!? People with businesses should think harder before naming their offices. Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk!) Well? What do you think? Basil: Our firm is doing very well at the moment. I don't think we need to borrow money. Phoenix: No, no, no! I mean about Mr. Elg! Basil: You think Glen had something to do with this Furio Tigre? Phoenix: Yes... Basil: I'm sorry. I don't know of any connection between the two of them. Phoenix: (Really? Because I've got proof that Mr. Elg and The Tiger knew each other.)

Basil: Let's ask one of my programmers what they think... Excuse me? What do you think? Programmer: I'm taking a break. Basil: Yes. Perhaps I should take a break, too. Phoenix: (I wish I could take a break from my troubles, but the rest stop was about a mile back.) Leads back to: \"It's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end.\" Phoenix: Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\". This is who Mr. Elg met with on the day of his murder. And the only thing a loan shark would talk with him about would be his debt! Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Basil: It's true that Glen had racked up quite a bit of debt from his gambling habit. About 100,000 dollars, I think. Phoenix: (100,000 dollars? Ouch!) Basil: But I heard he won the lottery, so he should have been in the clear. Phoenix: (Shame Maggey couldn't get a bit of that good luck.) OK... ...So the guy got lucky and won the lottery. But what if he hadn't won? What was his plan then? Basil: Well... This isn't easy to say, but... He said he would use his talents to repay the money. Phoenix: His \"talents\"? Basil: I suspect he was talking about programming. Phoenix: Wh-What computer program is worth 100,000 dollars!? Basil: ... Perhaps you good people should leave so I can get back to my work. Phoenix: (I'm so close to cracking her!) The program in question... Was it by any chance... this!? Present MC Bomber (after clearing \"MC Bomber\" Talk option in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Well? This is it, isn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: This is a very delicate matter. Without the necessary data, there's really no way I can access the information. Phoenix: (I know Mr. Elg created some sort of program! She can't deny it if I show her the program itself as evidence!) Leads back to: \"I'm so close to cracking her!\" Phoenix: Well?

Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Tender Lender Talk The head bandage (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Viola: Four months ago... I was in a traffic accident... That's why I needed the operation... When I woke up... they told me it was nothing serious... A simple procedure... Maya: Oh! Really? Phoenix: (Well, I guess if she recovered in 4 months, it couldn't have been too big...) Viola: They said the operation... cost one million dollars... Maya: A... A... A million bucks!? Viola: My grandfather ordered Don Tigre to pay... One million dollars... In \"compensation\"... Maya: \"Compensation\", huh...? Phoenix: It's underworld lingo for paying money to settle a score. Basically, pay or get into some serious trouble! (But a million bucks!? This has to be related to our poisoning case somehow...) Compensation (appears after \"The head bandage\") Leads to: \"I wanted to believe him... I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said...\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Head Bandage -- Phoenix: You said that bandage around your head was from an operation? Viola: ... Phoenix: You also said you suffered a \"fatal injury\" to the head, correct? Viola: Yes... The operation was very... difficult, apparently... Phoenix: Now, by \"fatal injury\", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right? Viola: ... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: Did the injury in question have something to do with this? Present Repair Bill Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have here a car repair bill.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Viola: Donuts...? Phoenix: Huh? Viola: I baked them myself... Home-made donuts... Have one... Phoenix: Umm, what's inside? Viola: Jam, and... ... Phoenix: I'm sorry, but I didn't quite catch that... Viola: Hee... Hee... Phoenix: Um... Thanks, but no thanks... I think I'll pass. (I guess that was a flop. What happened to this woman for her to have such a huge bandage around her head? There must be some piece of evidence that'll prompt her to tell me what happened...) Leads back to: \"Now, by \"fatal injury\", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right?\" Phoenix: I have here a car repair bill. From this, it seems pretty obvious that this car was involved in an accident. Viola: Let me see that... ... This bill is made out to the \"Cadaverinis\"...? Phoenix: Y-Yes, it is. Viola: I don't think... I ever introduced myself... Tell me... what do the \"Cadaverinis\"... have to do with me...? Phoenix: (Something tells me she's not about to say hi and introduce herself... Alright, then...) Your relationship with the Cadaverinis is very strong... And this is why.

Viola: ... 1 LOCK BROKEN Viola: It happened about 4 months ago... I was driving in one of our family's cars... when someone pulled out in front of me... It was a motorbike... or something like that... I don't remember it much... Anyway, I swerved to try to avoid it, but... ...I took a blow... to the head... A bad one. Phoenix: (Yeah, I can imagine...) So what happened to the person on the bike? I'm guessing they didn't get away with injuring THE Viola Cadaverini, right? Viola: I... don't know... what happened to them... They ran away... Or so I heard... Phoenix: Ran away? Viola: If they'd stayed, I'd have... Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: (Hmm, is it possible...?

I don't want to... think about it anymore... Here... try one of these tomatoes... We all picked them together... as a family... And I added my own, special, flavoring... Phoenix: N-No thanks! (The person who caused the accident was riding a motorbike... Who could it be?) Leads back to: \"Hmm, is it possible...? Could the person who committed the hit and run have been...?\" Phoenix: It was this man, wasn't it? He was the cause of your accident. Viola: ... It wasn't Don Tigre! I refuse to believe it! 1 LOCK BROKEN Viola: We collided... The motorbike, and my car... But Don Tigre isn't injured at all... is he? Phoenix: (It was The Tiger who caused Viola to crash. I can feel it! Plus, one of her locks just broke, so she must suspect it was him, too...) I'm sorry, Ms. Cadaverini... But I have proof that The Tiger was involved in a traffic accident on his bike! Present Scooter Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's not exactly a motorbike, but...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: And this is my proof! Viola: Hard-boiled eggs...? Please, try one... Phoenix: E-Eggs? Viola: I raised the chickens and these eggs came from myself... I invented a special diet... so their chicks would be blue... Phoenix: N-No, thanks! Leads back to: \"It was The Tiger who caused Viola to crash. I can feel it!\" Phoenix: It's not exactly a motorbike, but... ...Mr. Tigre rides around in a scooter, doesn't he? And you'll notice that the front wheel guard is badly damaged. Viola: ... Phoenix: Ms. Cadaverini... You know the truth, don't you? Viola: ... Hee... Hee... Hee... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: This repair bill was paid by Furio Tigre. The Cadaverinis have known for ages who caused the accident, haven't they? Viola: ... It's possible... Perhaps... Somewhere inside me... I know that may be true... Phoenix: (I knew it...) Viola: But... Don Tigre still saved my life... The operation was very complicated... It was very, very expensive... Phoenix: How much are we talking? Viola: ... Very, very, very expensive... Phoenix: (She seems kind of hesitant about giving me an actual figure. I should back off...) Well, anyway, it was The Tiger who paid for it, right? Viola: After I recovered... Don Tigre told me... He said he paid for the operation because... he cared about me... I... believe him... Phoenix: Really? But do you honestly believe that to be true? Viola: ... Phoenix: Do you want to know what I think...? I think the reason he paid the operation wasn't because of you, but someone else...

Roasty-toasty, that's me! Viola: Don Tigre told me, you see... Leads back to: \"He said he paid for the operation because... he cared about me...\" Phoenix: Perhaps I shouldn't be saying this, but... ...your grandfather, Bruto Cadaverini, controls a lot of \"dubious\" cash, right? And you are his beloved pride and joy. Viola: ... Phoenix: Sure, I don't know exactly how much the operation cost, but... ...if you weren't the granddaughter of Mr. Cadaverini... ...do you think Mr. Tigre would have paid the money? Viola: ...

Only a whole lot more real... And a whole lot scarier, too.) Viola: I wanted to believe him... I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said... He said it had nothing to do with my grandfather being Bruto Cadaverini... I wanted to believe he helped me because he cared about me. Not about my grandfather... But I knew... That wasn't really true... Maya: Wow. I'm so sorry. Viola: What he did to get the money was... It was... evil! Phoenix: ...! Viola: He said it was all for me... So I... I helped him... Maya: You helped him? In what way? Viola: Here... Take these... Phoenix: (What are these? Medical papers?) Viola: I'm Bruto Cadaverini's granddaughter... He had to pay compensation... He was made an offer... He simply... couldn't... refuse. Viola's Medical Papers added to the Court Record. Maya: Wow, I feel so bad for Viola. Phoenix: It's inexcusable! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: (There are two things that I consider inexcusable. Poisoning, and betrayal! Only a coward would hurt people using either of these tactics.) Maya: Is everything alright, Nick? Phoenix: We should get going. Right after we finish our espresso. Maya: Yeah. Phoenix: (I wouldn't need to convince Viola of anything else, so I guess I can get rid of this.)

Witnesses aren't permitted to eat evidence. Not that they ever would! ... Well, there's was [sic] a case once, where a young lad ate-- Phoenix: A-Anyway! If you had never met the victim before, how do explain this note he left?Tigre: There was some lame guy with that name, though. Wanted to borrow cash from me.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That's very strange. According to the manager of the firm where the victim worked... ...December 3rd was the date he had to repay his loan. He wasn't due to discuss borrowing money, but repaying what he owed... Tigre: Oh. Yeah. Maybe youse right. Whatever it was, it was goin' down at the beginnin' of December. Phoenix: So you did meet Mr. Elg, then!? Tigre: Hey, Wright. Youse might wanna cool your jets a sec.Tigre: I set up a meetin' with the guy... at my office, Tender Lender.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So your meeting wasn't supposed to be at Trés Bien, then? Tigre: Why would I wanna go to a dump like dat? If I wanna talk with my clients, I got an office decked out for the job. I got the best punching bag youse ever saw in there. Phoenix: (Not exactly a professional office you've got there, you know...) So you were in your office on the day in question?Tigre: I waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He didn't show up? Godot: Ha...! What do you think, Trite? Let's see. How does a dead man get from a French restaurant to a loan shark's office? Phoenix: And you yourself didn't go to Trés Bien? Tigre: What are you' tryin' to pin on me here? Phoenix: Um... Tigre: Why don't youse come down to my office? We can chat about this thing my way, yeah? I got the best punching bag youse ever saw in there. Phoenix: No, no! No need! I'm good, thanks! Tigre: Listen up! I ain't got nothin' more to say, except this.Tigre: I ain't never been to that Trés Bien joint, youse hear?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Never? Not even once? Tigre: Not even once.

Is there something you'd like to tell the court about these matches?\"Maya: Do you think he really didn't meet Glen Elg?Phoenix: Not likely. Because I'm convinced this guy's behind the whole thing.Maya: So you mean... that whole testimony he just gave was a lie?Phoenix: Of course. So we can't afford to give him time to think of ways to plug the leaks in it. I've got to nail him while I still can!Phoenix: Mr. Tigre. Is there something you'd like to tell the court about these matches?Tigre: Matches? What youse talkin' about?Phoenix: We found them in your office at Tender Lender. They're from \"that\" restaurant.Tigre: Wh...!?Phoenix: If you've really never been to Trés Bien before... ...what was a book of the restaurant's matches doing on your desk!?Tigre: Youse been snoopin' around in my stuff now too, wiseguy!? What are you', my ball and chain!? Ain't no broad controlling me!Judge: Order! Order! Well, witness? I think it's time you started telling us the truth, don't you?Tigre: Grrraaaaargh!Judge: S-Sorry! I'm terribly sorry! Forgive me!Tigre: I ain't no pussy-cat! I don't go back on what I said! But, OK... I was at the joint that day.Phoenix: Wh-What!? (Changed from [Whaaat!?] in the original release)Tigre: But listen good, alright? I might've been there, but I still never met that kid.Godot: Well, well... Looks like an order just came in for another testimony.Phoenix: (I'm this close to proving it was him! He did meet Glen Elg that day. And he did put poison in his coffee! He must have!)Witness Testimony-- At Trés Bien --Tigre: I was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon. When I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene. The guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete. I figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split. I heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office.Judge: I see... You didn't actually meet with him in the end, then. Well, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, please.Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.Tigre: Hold it! If I wait around here any longer, I ain't even gonna make the normal express. No more stupid questions.Godot: Ha...! No problem. Any time Trite presses you on something irrelevant, I'll see he pays a penalty.Judge: M-Mr. Godot! That's my job!Godot: Your job is to slam that little hammer of yours and call a guilty verdict. So do it!Judge: Y-Yes, sir!Tigre: The special express ain't cheap, Wright!

Doesn't the rule of law mean anything around here!?)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- At Trés Bien --Tigre: I was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the meeting wasn't due to take place at Tender Lender at all then? Tigre: The kid was makin' a fuss about comin' into de office. It's always that way when I wanna talk about repayments. Even though I got the best punching bag you' ever seen if there are any \"issues\". Phoenix: (Maybe it's because of the punching bag that people are scared to come?) So that's why you decided to meet at Trés Bien? Godot: Godot: Ha...! You're going over old ground again, Trite. Phoenix: S-Sorry. Godot: You just earned yourself a penalty. Now suck it down! Judge: You will suck down the penalty, Mr. Wright. And you will like it! Phoenix: (Thank you, sir, may I have another!)Tigre: When I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: An \"ugly scene\"? What do you mean? Godot: Godot: The witness has already told us, Trite. Which makes that question... irrelevant! Phoenix: B-But...! Godot: I limit myself to 17 cups of coffee during a trial. That's the rule. You better limit the number of times you take a penalty, Trite. Or your guts will look like the inside of a chimney! Ashen! Judge: Don't make me burn you again, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (I guess I shouldn't have pressed him on that.) Tigre: Guess I'm gonna make that special express after all. Judge: So, to recap... This \"ugly scene\" you saw was...?Present Trés Bien Floor Plans Phoenix: Leads to: \"You're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?\"Tigre: The guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean you saw Glen Elg's dead body? Tigre: I guess I did. But I only saw him from behind. He was wearin' some raggy bit of cloth he called a hat. Phoenix: And what time was this? Tigre: I dunno. Phoenix: Huh? Tigre: You' know what winds me up more than anythin' else in the world? Watches! Round watches! I ain't gonna pollute my paws wid some tickin' henpecker! Judge: Out of interest, Mr. Tigre, what winds you up the second most? Tigre: Huh? Whad'youse think!? Square watches! Phoenix: (Is this guy for real!?) Tigre: Look, all I need to know was that somethin' bad was goin' down in that place.Present Trés Bien Floor Plans Phoenix: Leads to: \"You're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?\"Tigre: I figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you didn't actually set foot inside the restaurant, then? Tigre: The Tiger is a busy cat. I don't hang around for no one. I ain't got time to be caught up in no murder investigation. Phoenix: So, when exactly did you pick up the matches? Godot: There are matches just inside the front door. Our detective friend wound up in trouble with the chef after taking 5 books home. Phoenix: (Poor Gumshoe... It's almost enough to make a man cry...)Tigre: I heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You went straight back? Did a bout of guilt suddenly hit you for what you did? Tigre: What're youse trying to say!? You' tryin' to tell me youse ain't never been guilty of nothin'? Phoenix: Um... Godot: We all have our crosses to bear. We all have to swallow the dark secrets we hide... ...Like this! Phoenix: (The courtroom's not exactly the place to talk about dark secrets, is it?) Judge: It seems you've done it again, Mr. Wright. Another irrelevant line of questioning. I must impose a penalty accordingly! Phoenix: (How about a penalty for those two jokers and the garbage they keep coming up with!?)Maya: Well, Nick? What do you think?Phoenix: He's running out of ways to avoid the truth. I need to press him fast before he has time to think things through. I've got to come right back at him with a contradiction!Maya: Be careful what you press him on, though, or you'll get penalized, OK?\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

    "cot": "The contradiction lies between the evidence and testimony about the time and location of the victim at the time of the incident.\n\nEvidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows that there was no one sitting across from the victim at the table, indicating that the victim was alone at the table.\n\nTestimony 1 and 2 by Tigre says: \"When I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene.\" and \"The guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete.\" which supports the victim was found there alone.\n\nHowever, Byrde (not in the testimony list provided but in the text), claims there was another person at the victim's table who slipped the poison into the coffee.\n\nMoreover, the evidence 11 (Tres Bien Floor Plans) shows the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio, implying that other witnesses could have missed another person sitting at the victim's table.\n\nBut focusing only on the evidence and testimonies given, a clear contradiction is in the testimonies of Tigre himself:\n\nHe testifies that he was supposed to meet the victim \"wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon\" (Testimony 0) meaning he was expecting a meeting at the restaurant and then Testimony 4 says \"I heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office,\" and Testimony 3 says \"I figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split,\" implying he didn't meet the victim.\n\nTestimony 2 says \"The guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete.\"\n\nBut later Tigre claims he didn't meet the victim (Testimony 0), but presence is implied by evidence that the victim marked \"Meet with The Tiger\" on his calendar (Evidence 20), which suggests a planned meeting.\n\nThe contradiction is that Tigre claims never to have met the victim, but the calendar (Evidence 20) indicates a meeting was planned.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar - note about meeting The Tiger) and Tigre's testimony 0 (he claims he was supposed to meet, but never did).\n\nSo we can select:\n\nEvidence 20: Glen's Calendar - note saying \"Meet with The Tiger.\"\n\nTestimony 0: Tigre says \"I was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon.\" but denies meeting him.\n\nHence, the contradiction is between these.\n",

This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. I-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me! Judge: The evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee. No! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me? Payne: Well... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!? Judge: This court finds the defendant... Guilty Judge: The court is adjourned. January 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Ahh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world! Phoenix: I bet it does, Maya. Maya: So! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think? Phoenix: Sure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake. Maya: Never! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game. ???: HEY, PAL! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... Maya: Happy New Year, Detective! Gumshoe: Uh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA... Maya: Here's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation! Gumshoe: Um... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO... Maya: Have you got a holiday present for me, Detective? Gumshoe: A what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but... Maya: Yay! Thanks! Gumshoe: LOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT! Maya: Hey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you? Gumshoe: Ah... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose? Maya: Ha ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year? Gumshoe: Very funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this! Phoenix: What is it? A magazine? Maya: Hey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\" Phoenix: Tr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!? Gumshoe: It's a report, pal. About you! Maya: Listen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\" Gumshoe: WELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it! Phoenix: But I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway? Gumshoe: Umm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month. Maya: Which makes it old news, you mean. Phoenix: But I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December! Maya: Hmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick? Gumshoe: If it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility... Maya: No way. You don't mean... Phoenix: A pho... Maya: A phony Nick!? Phoenix: (This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...) Magazine Clipping added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: SO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!? Phoenix: What do you mean, what am I going to do about it? Maya: Well, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case! Phoenix: My fault!? How do you figure that? Maya: Because THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of... Gumshoe: Yeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves? Phoenix: (But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...) Gumshoe: You better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it? Maya: Sounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto! Phoenix: I don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned. Maya: ... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year. Gumshoe: So you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!? Phoenix: (I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least pretend to read them once in a while. Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's sort of a keepsake... something to remember Mia by. Sure, the office is a mess, but I never forget to water this little fella. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so it's still super neat and tidy from when Pearls cleaned it. Movie poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I have to check it out one of these days. Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they bought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called \"Gatewater Land\". ...I wonder if that bellboy is going to send me a greeting card this year, too? Talk What to do Maya: So, what's our first move? Phoenix: I guess we go down to the detention center and talk-- Maya: Wait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right? Phoenix: Hey, hey! Let's get one thing straight. It wasn't me, it was a fake me that did this! Maya: Hmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean. Phoenix: (I hope not. *shudder* ...And what kind of name for an evil double is Xin Eohp anyway!?) Maya: Ah! Nick! I've got it! Phoenix: If you're going to ask whether I've got a twin brother, the answer is no. Maya: ...Spoilsport. Any ideas Maya: Did you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me? Phoenix: What do you mean? Maya: I mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess he was acting kind of strange. Maya: Maybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick! Phoenix: ... Considering how we interact, I seriously doubt that, Maya... Maya: Well, if he wasn't nervous because of you... Phoenix: ...then maybe it's because of our new guilty client? Present Attorney's Badge Maya: So you've still got that badge, I see. Phoenix: Huh!? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I? Maya: Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job. Phoenix: (...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.) Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe you've got an impersonator. Phoenix: I can't either. *sigh* Maya: Aww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people impersonating them! Phoenix: This isn't funny, Maya. It's not just an impersonation. This guy stole my identity! And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result. Maya: ...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick? Phoenix: (...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day. Phoenix: ...That's called \"taking a shower\". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it's because Maya's at a loss these days...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia helped me out in court again last time. Maya: It's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that. Phoenix: Yeah... Maya: We mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis... Phoenix: ...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don't we just have Pearls call her? Maya: No... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her. Phoenix: (I guess Maya's got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.) Godot profile Maya: So you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh? Phoenix: I already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much. Maya: Well he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter. Phoenix: You're just making that up, Maya! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: Digging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it? Phoenix: No. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him. Maya: Yeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears! Phoenix: (Did you mean he \"gets paid dirt\" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?) Any other evidence Phoenix: Do you know anything about this, Maya? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) Any other profile Phoenix: Do you know anything about this person? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everyone, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this individual. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: It's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick? Phoenix: Looks like Gumshoe isn't around. Maya: He's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work! Phoenix: No, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case. Maya: Guess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh? Phoenix: After being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Don't die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!\" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that's the key. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Desks Phoenix: These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks. Poster Phoenix: A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT! Mask☆DeMasque turned up at the bank? What's he doing!? \"Hands up, you scalawags!\" \"You're under arrest!\" Hey! That's our job! Phoenix: (Looks like Ron DeLite's opted for a new career.) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\", right Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Umm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: This is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...? Phoenix: K-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me! ???: Aaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying. Phoenix: A-Aren't... you... ???: Yes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down! Maya: Aah! You're... Are you...? ??? Don't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Maggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt-- Byrde: Oh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!? Maya: You better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick. Byrde: O-Oh... I see... Phoenix: So that's where we stand right now. Maya: I'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder... Byrde: My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures. Phoenix: (I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...) Byrde: But I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir! Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. I bet they don't get too many waitresses in here. He looks like he's getting a bit restless. Talk Maggey Byrde Maya: So, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform. Byrde: Hmph. I was fired after that... incident last year. Maya: Oh. I'm sorry. Byrde: It's OK. I don't mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on. Maya: So, what do you do now? Byrde: In the second act of \"The Life of Maggey Byrde\", I'm playing the role of a waitress! Maya: A waitress!? Byrde: Yes. In a French restaurant. It's a small place, but it's quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir. Phoenix: And then you got into this mess straight away, right? Byrde: Yeah, you could put it that way... What happened Byrde: This whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Trés Bien. Maya: \"Treh Bee-an\"...? Byrde: Yes. It's a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included! Maya: Oh... Byrde: There were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim's cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out. Maya: Hey, hold on there, Maggey. Byrde: What? Maya: You keep calling the guy, \"the victim\". Didn't you know the guy who was killed? Byrde: Not at all! I'd never even seen the guy before! Maya: Oh... Phoenix: (So she wouldn't have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right? Byrde: Of course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele. Phoenix: So, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come? Byrde: ......... You tell me, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ack! (Guess the answer to my question is \"my phony\"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.) Guilty verdict (appears after \"What happened\") Maya: So, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted? Byrde: Because no one else saw. Maya: Saw what? Byrde: The other man. The one who put the poison in the victim's coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. \"The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time.\" Phoenix: But how's that possible? Byrde: I don't know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could've done a better job! Phoenix: Look! That wasn't me, OK? Byrde: And then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket. Maya: What? Byrde: A small bottle... of poison. Maya: WHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!? Byrde: Well, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must've slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious. Phoenix: And no one else saw this other guy? Byrde: No, sir. That's what everyone said. But I don't see how they could've missed him... The other guy (appears after \"Guilty verdict\") Byrde: I was the one who took the coffee to the two men. Phoenix: O-Oh...? And what was your impression of them? Byrde: Well... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry. Maya: In music? How come? Byrde: Well, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician's look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Maya: An earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all? Byrde: It had a band's name written on it. I think it was \"MC\"-something. They must've been preparing for their debut, I guess. Phoenix: So it was a band's CD. Maybe a promo disc? Maya: Maybe it was \"MC Screwdriver\"! Phoenix: Get serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that? Byrde: Nngh... What was the name of that group again...? \"MC Hacksaw...\"? No... \"MC...\" Maya: And what about the killer? What did he look like? Byrde: Well, I, um... I don't really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really. Present Attorney's Badge Byrde: That badge! Is it real? Phoenix: Of course it's real! Byrde: That's what they all say. But I've been duped before. Give it to me for a sec! Phoenix: Ah...! ...*chomp!* Maya: She... She bit into it... Byrde: And I left a few teeth marks, too! Phoenix: I can see that... Byrde: I just wish I could remember if that means it's real or a fake. Phoenix: *sigh* (I said it was real!) Magazine Clipping Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I need to ask you about this... Byrde: Hey! This article's about my case! Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me? Byrde: Yes, sir! It was the morning after I'd been arrested... I met you in the visitor's room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits. Phoenix: Me? Byrde: Yes, you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Argh... Maya: Hey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too? Byrde: No. I don't remember a phony you, Maya. Maya: Oh... *sigh* It would've been so cool... Byrde: Then you got really worked up and passionate. \"I'm gonna get you' cleared'a dis crime!\" you said. (Changed from ['I'm gonna get you cleared of this crime!' you said.] in the original release) Phoenix: OK, I get the picture. But you've met me in person before... So how come you didn't realize that guy wasn't the real me? Byrde: ... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange... Phoenix: Only a little? Byrde: Well, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And... Phoenix: So the guy was nothing like me, then!? Byrde: But he had your spiky hair and blue suit. Phoenix: (... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?) Maya: How about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter? Byrde: Everyone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir. Maya: This case just keeps getting weirder and weirder... Maya Fey profile Byrde: Thanks for your help last year! Maya: Aw, it was nothing. I'm glad we got you off the hook. Byrde: I hope you can help me out this year, too! Maya: Yeah, me too. It's be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned. Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Oh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force! Phoenix: Have you seen him recently? Byrde: No. He's never been to the restaurant. Maya: Guess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all. Byrde: Yeah, he prefers the simple things in life. Phoenix: (...Or he's just simply too poor to afford anything else.) Maggey Byrde profile Byrde: No matter what happens, I never let anything get me down! Maya: You're always so positive, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! The early Byrde catches the worm! A Byrde in the hand! Maya: Wow! All those phrases are named after you? Byrde: And I never turn my back on anything! Maya: You're always so strong, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! I'm a tough old Byrde! Maya: \"Tough old byrde\", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it? Phoenix: ...Yeah, I get it. Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be on the police force, sir. But I'm incarcerated, now. So I can't use my connections to help you. All I can tell you about now is info about ex-cons or the clientele of Trés Bien, sir... Maya: Aww, don't let it get you down, Maggey! After clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping: Byrde: Mr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial? Phoenix: Probably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial. Byrde: Um... Mr. Wright...? Phoenix: ? Byrde: Do you think we'll win next time? ...Sir? Phoenix: ...! Byrde: My life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck! Maya: Argh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this! Phoenix: Wh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!) Maya: We'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you! Byrde: Thank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then! Phoenix: Trés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place. Byrde: Yes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi! Maya: Sure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food! January 6Trés Bien Maya: Wow! Look at this place. Phoenix: \"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right? Maya: Actually, I'm not all that into it... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here. Phoenix: Don't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here! Maya: Perfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want! Phoenix: (Yeah, I suppose we can...) Examine Cash register Maya: Look, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money. Phoenix: You know, you're the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way! Trinkets Maya: Look at all the little trinkets tucked away in here. Phoenix: I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let's see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups! Maya: ... I never knew you were so... cultured. Phoenix: Come on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much! Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? It'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then. Phoenix: Hm? There's something stuffed in behind the rack. Maya: ...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. \"MC Bomber\", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe? Phoenix: I wonder what \"MC Bomber\" is supposed to be...? ! (This paper! It's from December 3rd...) This paper's from the day of the poisoning! Maya: WHAT!? Sports Paper added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...) Magazine rack (subsequent times) Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Looks like Mr. Armstrong doesn't get any newspapers. Maya: Well, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it? Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" like in these mags, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Phoenix: (We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I'd better try to find out everything I can about it...) Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: What do you think this flower is, Nick? Phoenix: Let's see... Well, it doesn't look like a tulip, and it's not a sunflower, I don't think... Maya: Duh. Even I could've told you that. Phoenix: Well, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I'm a lawyer, not a botanist! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got you! I was only kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Crime scene Phoenix: This must be the table where the murder occurred. Maya: I guess so, with all this police tape all around it. Phoenix: And that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don't go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya? Maya: Why would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know! Phoenix: (Then why can I picture you doing just that?) Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Sports Paper Maya: Hmm... \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: There's something about that name, \"MC Bomber\". Phoenix: Yeah, It's a pretty unusual name. Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: Everyone's worried about bombs these days, I guess. Phoenix: I'm not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...) Maya: Anyway, we should really look into this some more! Maggey Byrde profile Maya: This is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then. Maya: Wasn't she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We're gonna get her off the hook or I'll give up hamburgers! Detention Center Present Sports Paper Byrde: Oh! A sports paper. Let's see, let's see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title? Phoenix: Sorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It's from the day of the murder... Maya: And Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid. Byrde: Oh, no... Phoenix: I found this paper in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Byrde: Really? That's strange... Trés Bien doesn't get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he's not really fond of them. Maya: Then maybe one of the customers left it behind? Phoenix: Anyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here. Byrde: Ah-ha! That's it, sir! \"MC Bomber\"! That was the name that was written on the CD! Phoenix: (Just as I thought...) Maya: I guess it wasn't \"MC Screwdriver\" after all, huh... Byrde: So, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right? Maya: If someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! \"The Master of Kurain\" or \"The Spirit Song\" or even \"Maya's Theme\"! Phoenix: Um, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim's table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim! Maya: You're right! Phoenix: (So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...) Maya: I think we better step up the investigation, don't you Nick? After presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 6Trés Bien ???: Oh là là! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Trés Bien! Maya: Oh! Hel... lo... ... Phoenix: (What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...) ???: Bienvenue! Welcome to my petite restauranté! Maya: Huh? \"Bee Avenue\"? ???: Oh, non, my petite chulip! Maya: Huh? Me? ???: Look at z'is face! Like la kitten rejected by its own mother. You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil mélange of la néroli and la rose. My personal recommendation! Maya: You think I need what...? ???: Oui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voilá! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique! Maya: Really? ???: And for la monsieur! Phoenix: Who? Me? ???: Look at z'at face! Like la puppy rejected by life itself! You are fatigued, non? For you, monsieur, I recommend z'is! Oil of bergamot. And maybe a 'int of... Oui, oui! I will add la peppermint and la clary sage for a fragrance exceptionnel! Such an invigorating recipe will bring out your delicious beauty, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My beauty!? ???: Alors. If you will be seated, I will bring you la special menu of z'e day! Phoenix: Actually, we're not here to eat. We're lawyers. ???: Mais bien sûr! I know z'is already, monsieur. You are la Phoenix Wright, non? Phoenix: Um, yes... You know me? ???: Mais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court! Maya: I guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp... Phoenix: It looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already. Maya: I wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you? Armstrong: Allow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté! Talk Trés Bien Maya: So what does \"Trés Bien\" mean? I know \"trés\". That means \"three\", right? Armstrong: Non, non, non! \"Trés Bien\" is Français! In English, you would say, \"Very Good\". Maya: Oh. Very good... Armstrong: Oui, exactement! La atmosphere is trés bien, and la cuisine is trés bien! Phoenix: (If the food's good, why aren't there any customers in here?) Armstrong: My cuisine is not for all. Some people, z'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine. Phoenix: (I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...) Armstrong: Since I 'ave lost Maggey, I do not 'ave enough 'ands. Phoenix: So, you're running this place on your own now? Armstrong: Oui. For la moment. No one 'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi! Phoenix: (... Please don't eyeball me while you say that.) Armstrong: I am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist. Maya: A roaming what? Armstrong: A practitioner d'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z'e delicate floral aromas. Phoenix: (Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...) What happened Phoenix: So, could you tell me what you know about the incident? Armstrong: Bien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z'an a month 'as passed since it 'appened. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess it's been about a month since Maggey's sentencing...) Armstrong: So. It was z'e third of last month. Just after one in z'e afternoon. A man who was in 'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill. Phoenix: Because of the poison in his coffee? Armstrong: Z'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took 'is drink to 'im. I was in la kitchen. I 'eard z'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, 'e was already slumped in 'is chair. Maya: He was dead? Armstrong: Mon dieu! Oui! 'E was dead! Maggey 'ad passed out also. Phoenix: And this man who died... Was he alone? Armstrong: Oui, monsieur. All alone. I know z'at Maggey said z'ere was someone else, but... Maya: I see... Armstrong: La police, z'ey asked me many times. \"Are you sure z'ere was no one else at z'e table?\" z'ey asked. But I am not z'e only one. La old man said z'e same thing. Phoenix: Old man? What old man? Old man (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Um... So who is the old man that you mentioned? Armstrong: At z'e time of la murder, z'ere was another customer in 'ere. Maya: What!? Someone else saw it? Armstrong: Mais, oui! As usual, 'e came alone z'at day. At z'e time of la murder, 'e was 'ere. 'E saw it, too. But 'e said z'e same thing, z'at z'ere was no one else at la victim's table. Maya: But Maggey swears there were two people! Armstrong: Mais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, 'e could not prove z'is, non? Phoenix: About the lawyer. That was me, I suppose? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr! Phoenix: ... Wow! He's the first person who's said it wasn't me. Maya: Don't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!? Maggey's motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile) Phoenix: When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen? Armstrong: Ou... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so. Phoenix: So what happened? Armstrong: Non. It was, er... It was nothing. Maya: Look, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive! Armstrong: Oui. It is true. Phoenix: If there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant. Maya: So please! Tell us anything you know. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock!?] in the original release) Maya: No way! What are we going to do, Nick? Phoenix: We'll just have to remov... WHAT THE!? Maya: Wh-What's wrong? Phoenix: The Magatama... It's gone! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: I had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air! Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (But I could see the Psyche-Locks. (Changed from [But I could see the Psyche-Lock.] in the original release) Maybe that means the Magatama's nearby...?) Maggey's motive (subsequent times) Phoenix: Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim. 3 PSYCHE LOCKS Armstrong: N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qué será, será. Perhaps Maggey 'ad another reason. Phoenix: (What's Maggey's motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock [sic] must mean it's nearby.) Maya: I only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK? Phoenix: (...And here I thought it was mine to keep!) Present Attorney's Badge Armstrong: Please, monsieur. Z'ere is no need to show me z'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z'e worst defense lawyer in town. Phoenix: (I think I can imagine how he formed this completely wrong impression of me...) Um, the last time we met, did I show you this badge? Armstrong: Oui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant! Maya: Looks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick! Magazine Clipping Armstrong: I am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z'at day was a little, how you say, \"lacking\", per'aps? Phoenix: *sigh* Armstrong: Even a Frenchman who cannot speak any English could 'ave done a better job! You were very cool, though. Oh, oui, oui! So 'andsome. Maya: Wow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been... Armstrong: Every time you opened your mouth, z'e 'ole courthouse stirred. Phoenix: (Oh, man. That is something I don't want to imagine...) Sports Paper Phoenix: We found this sports paper in the magazine rack here. Armstrong: One of my customers must 'ave left it behind. Maya: Do you have any idea which customer it was? Armstrong: Z'e only ideas I 'ave, mademoiselle, I save for my kitchen! Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: If you want a job 'ere, it is yours, precious! Mia Fey profile Armstrong: Mon dieu! What beauty! Maya: That's my sister! Armstrong: Ah, oui? Another delight! But you 'ave a certain je ne sais quois z'at I do not sense from your sister. Maya: I do? Armstrong: So throw your head 'ead 'igh! Thrust out your feminine features! Do not lose 'eart, ma fille! You are a woman! A woman extraordinaire! Maya: Do I look like I need cheering up or something? Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Maggey was a policewoman once, n'est-ce pas? Phoenix: Yes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control. Armstrong: Oui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non? Maya: Oh... You know about that? Armstrong: Z'at is why I gave to 'er la perfume for la 'appiness. Phoenix: Happiness perfume? Armstrong: Oui. Blended from bergamot, like I 'ave given to you before. Phoenix: But she's been arrested again. And found guilty this time. Armstrong: Z'is is true. 'Er natural aroma of un'appiness must 'ave been very strong. Phoenix: (Just admit it! Your perfume doesn't work!) Armstrong: I am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z'at took place before my very eyes. Maya: Something like what? Phoenix: (What's this guy talking about!?) Maya: Does this mean... Maggey did have a motive? Phoenix: We've got to ask this guy for more info, stat! Jean Armstrong profile Armstrong: It is 'ard to imagine, I know, but I was an apprentice for five years in la gay Paris. Maya: Wow! In Paris!? Armstrong: It was something la chef z'ere said to me z'at made me decide to open my own restaurant. Phoenix: What was it? Armstrong: Z'at awful man said to me, \"You must train for another ten years!\" Oh! It was such a shock! So unexpected! But you would 'ave to be a fool to do z'is, non? Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Armstrong: Félicitations! Mais... qu'est-ce que c'est? Phoenix: Ack! Um... Je... Je no comprehend... Maya: Nick! Don't just make something up! After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there? Armstrong: ... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves. Maya: Huh? \"'Im\"? Armstrong: La old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc. Phoenix: La p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that? Armstrong: Behind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\". Maya: Thank you! Armstrong: Je vous en prie, my dear! Maya: Let's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick! January 6Vitamin Square Maya: So this is Vitamin Square. Phoenix: Yeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you. Maya: Hey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about? Phoenix: That grouchy-looking grandpa? Maya: He's throwing seeds out for the pigeons. Phoenix: Maya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them! Old Man: ... Phoenix: (Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...) Examine Sandbox Maya: I used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe! Phoenix: Really? You? Maya: Sure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do. Phoenix: Iron filings? Wow... That's too exciting for words. Maya: It was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then! Phoenix: So, did you manage to get all the iron? Maya: No, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them? Phoenix: No. Fruit attractions Maya: This place is so fruity! Phoenix: That's not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They're among my favorites. Maya: Then that apple slide is perfect for you! Phoenix: ... And what is so \"perfect\" about it? Maya: Oh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo! Phoenix: No way! I'd get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that. Maya: Yeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too. Pigeons Maya: Hey, look. Pigeons! Phoenix: Yeah. And heaps of them, too. Maya: Did you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace? Phoenix: That's a dove, not a pigeon. Maya: ... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony? Phoenix: You're over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya. Magazine on orange-themed seat Maya: Ooh, there's a magazine here. Phoenix: It's a magazine full of job listings. Old Man: You disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away! Phoenix: \"Threw away\"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job? Old Man: Kah! That's none of your business! Phoenix: Sorry! I guess I'll take the magazine with me then. Old Man: I don't want anyone else having it! Give it back! Phoenix: (Too bad. Now that you want it so bad, I don't want to give it up!) Job Listings added to the Court Record. Old Man: Hey! That's mine! Closer orange-themed seat (after examining magazine on orange-themed seat) Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: You don't have to tell me twice. Talk What you saw Phoenix: Um... Excuse me. Old Man: ... Phoenix: Would you mind if I had a word with you? Old Man: Yes! Phoenix: I just want to ask you a couple of questions... Old Man: What's the matter with you!? Can't you see I'm busy? So you don't like my seeds, eh, pigeons!? Phoenix: (He's really chucking those seeds at them! That's got to hurt!) Old Man: Go on! Eat this! Phoenix: (*sigh*) Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Maya: Yes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Kah! It's a disgrace, I tell you. An utter disgrace! Maya: A disgrace? Old Man: An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: Revealing!? You mean her uniform? Old Man: The youth of today! They don't have any shame! No shame, I tell you! Not one ounce! Whatever happened to the old bushido values of Japan, like honor and modesty? Maya: What about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing. Old Man: You!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace! Maya: Talk about hitting a girl where it hurts... Trés Bien Phoenix: Do you go to Trés Bien a lot? Old Man: Hmph! That miserable excuse for a restaurant? That garbage they serve in there's not food. Where's the sushi? The tempura? The rice!? Phoenix: Trés Bien is a French restaurant, sir... Old Man: Where do you think we are, boy? In Paris!? I want real food, not those snooty snacks! And what about those shameless girls!? Phoenix: You mean the waitresses? Old Man: You can see all the way up to their... their... Yes! The waitresses! They're practically naked! It's a disgrace, isn't it? Well, isn't it!? Phoenix: Listen, it's not my restaurant. Old Man: Kah! It's a miserable excuse for a restaurant, that place! Miserable! Phoenix: (He certainly knows the place. He must be a regular! But if he hates it so much, why does he keep going?) Trés Bien regular (appears after \"Trés Bien\") Maya: Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir? Old Man: ... Maya: It's just, if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Maya: He must be hiding something, right? Phoenix: If he is, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock... Oh, wait... I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... Maya: Remember, Nick. That Magatama is only on loan. You better find it or else! Phoenix: (If Pearls ever gets wind of this, I'm going to be in a world of pain...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, excuse me, sir. Could I just ask you about this... Old Man: ... Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: Here you go, boy! How does some pigeon feed sound to you!? Phoenix: (This wasn't exactly what I was hoping to get out of this guy...) Detention Center Present Job Listings Maya: Um, Maggey... Byrde: Oh, are you looking for some part-time work, Maya? Why don't you take a job at the restaurant? I bet Mr. Armstrong would hire you. Maya: Really? Me? Byrde: It's pretty cool being a waitress, you know. And in the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets! Maya: What secrets...? Byrde: You can't make it obvious, but just spy on him for a bit. You'll see. It's interesting. Maya: Wow! I can't wait to get my apron on now! Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Oh, so you met the owner, Mr. Armstrong! Phoenix: He's, um... Oh, how can I put this... pretty unique, huh? Byrde: He has a really intense aura. As a chef and as a person. Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Trés Bien Examine Cash register (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's really tight behind the cash register counter. Can Mr. Armstrong even get in there? And if he got in... could he get out again? Trinkets (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: There's a bunch of little trinkets on a shelf by the door. I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Magazine rack (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Ugh. All the clothes in these are absolutely atrocious! ...Some of them have been circled in red. ... I really hope Mr. Armstrong is not thinking of buying those. Table (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong must be a pretty big neat-freak. He already has this table ready to go. Now if only the food in this place was edible... Windows (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It looks pretty cold out there on the streets. Peaceful, though. It's nice that people can take it easy after the holiday rush. Crime scene (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: This must be the table where the poisoning occurred. The stain tells the story well. The whole area is still cordoned off with police tape. I guess it must still be under investigation. Present Job Listings Armstrong: Mademoiselle! Maya: Y-Yes? Armstrong: Are you looking for la job? Maya: What!? N-No, no. I was just... Armstrong: Let me see. Your style is un peu différent, but you 'ave a good face. Maya: ...Different? Armstrong: Félicitations! You 'ave passed! I will 'ire you! Bien! Come wiz me. I will teach you everyz'ing I know! Maya: N-Nick! HEEEEEELP! Phoenix: (I don't know whether to laugh or feel bad for Maya... Maybe I should do both...?) Vitamin Square Examine Sandbox Phoenix: When I think back to when I was young... ...I wonder what I found so great about playing in a sandbox. Maybe I'll come back here in the middle of the night one of these days to relive it. ... On second thought, being arrested by Gumshoe would be too embarrassing to bear. Fruit attractions Phoenix: You don't see many parks like this anymore. What a great place for kids to play. But that old man's the only one here, chucking his seeds at the pigeons. Pigeons Phoenix: The pigeons are so busy pecking at the seeds, they don't notice anything else. Seeing those birds eat with such intense focus... ...reminds me of Maya when she's scarfing down a burger. Closer orange-themed seat Phoenix: This is where I found that job listings magazine before. A guy like me carrying around a magazine like that kind of gives the wrong impression. I guess I better give it back to that old man once this investigation's over. Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Yes, you do. You know, the waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Hmph! If you ask me It's a disgrace! Th-That's what it is! An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: So, you didn't like that kind of thing, then? Old Man: ... Wh-What are you trying to say about me, boy!? Explain yourself! Phoenix: Um, nothing! I'm not saying anything about you... Old Man: I know your kind! You young ones with your spiky hair and your fancy suits! That heads of yours is over-flowing with filthy ideas! Phoenix: (...I know someone who needs to learn some stress management.) Old Man: Get out of here, you young brat! Trés Bien regular Phoenix: So, you are a regular at that restaurant, right, sir? Old Man: ... Phoenix: You're always complaining about the place, so why do you go there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Phoenix: (Something's not right about this guy... But If he's hiding something, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock.) Oh, wait... (I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... I need to find it before I can get anywhere with this old man.) After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Looks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later. Examine Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. There's nothing for him to do right now, so he's catching some vertical z's. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Poor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Trés Bien once things have cooled off. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Well, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!? Phoenix: Um, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation. Gumshoe: Well, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's really fired up about this...) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor... Phoenix: (Oh. ... Him.) Gumshoe: Now, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again... Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Gumshoe: Um... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!? Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Hitting the gas is like hitting the fast-forward button on your life.\" No. That's too obscure. You don't really get the \"you'll die before your time\" idea. I need something more direct. Something a bit more light-hearted. Something like, \"Hitting the gas is your passport to paradise!\" Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT!? Poisoned coffee waitress gets a retrial!? I knew it! I knew there was something funny about the taste of this coffee! OK! Who brought me this coffee today? Hands up! Phoenix: (Yeesh! Have a little faith in your subordinates!) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Phoenix: No matter what, whenever I come here, that mascot's there to greet me. Chief: You got that right. That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Phoenix: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're married. Phoenix: (So should I expect to see Baby Badger next time I'm here...?) Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: So the guilty party was Maggey Byrde, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah... Phoenix: Back when she was on the police force... ...you were her mentor when she was a rookie, right? Gumshoe: Yeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened. Phoenix: (Gumshoe sure is sweating up a storm over nothing... ...Ah, so that's it! Our big ol' Gumshoe has a little ol' crush on Maggey!) Gumshoe: I... I don't like her or anything! I... I was... Aaaargh! Phoenix: (Note to self: Gossip with Maya about this later!) Gumshoe: Look, pal! Don't tell anyone, OK!? You've gotta keep it a secret, got it!? Phoenix: S-Sure... And would you mind not guessing what I'm thinking all the time? Gumshoe: Hey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind. The victim Phoenix: So I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim? Gumshoe: Glen Elg, he was a computer programmer. Phoenix: I see. A programmer... Gumshoe: He was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal. Phoenix: (Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often? Gumshoe: Not according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy. Phoenix: (A programmer... and a first-time customer at that...) (Changed from [A programmer... and a first-time customer...] in the original release) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that? Gumshoe: That's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial. Phoenix: You're kidding! What was her supposed \"motive\"? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK? Phoenix: (What could this motive have been...?) The investigation Gumshoe: This isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself. Phoenix: O-Oh, that's right... Gumshoe: The judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony. Phoenix: Yeah... Doesn't sound very good for us, huh? Gumshoe: Look, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop. Phoenix: (That's not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony? Contradictions (appears after \"The investigation\") Gumshoe: The biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table. Phoenix: Yeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim. Gumshoe: Right. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD... Phoenix: (CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...) Byrde: And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Gumshoe: But our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD. Phoenix: What? Gumshoe: Not on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal. Phoenix: But didn't Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too? Gumshoe: Yeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie. Phoenix: A radio? He didn't have a CD player? Gumshoe: You got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all. Phoenix: (Come to think of it... The owner of Trés Bien didn't mention that CD either. I don't know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong's got something to hide...) The charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile) Phoenix: So what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Trés Bien? Gumshoe: It's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected with the case anyway... Phoenix: Hey, come on, Detective. Didn't you say you'd give me the dirt on anything? Gumshoe: Well, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stuff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK? Phoenix: Um... Don't suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Trés Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.) Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? (I've got to track this creep down!) Magazine Clipping Gumshoe: I wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was. Phoenix: And what did he say? Gumshoe: He started off by saying, \"I'm at a complete loss for words...\" But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour. Phoenix: But... Gumshoe: He said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty! Phoenix: (It looked like I was \"trying to get Maggey found guilty\"...?) Sports Paper Gumshoe: What's that? A sports paper? Phoenix: Yeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Gumshoe: It's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here. Phoenix: And take a look at this. See this writing here? Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... Hey! Phoenix: What is it? Gumshoe: I've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Gumshoe: Hey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble. Phoenix: (Handwriting, huh? It'd be good to know more about that, in any case...) Gumshoe: Thanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue! Sports Paper given to Detective Gumshoe. Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: Hey! So how come she's not with you today? Phoenix: She's working down at the restaurant right now. Gumshoe: Working, huh? Yeah, it's tough being broke. I would know. Phoenix: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: Next time I see her, I'll show her how to make the world's best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It's the only way! Phoenix: (Um... Why is he shaking my hand with such enthusiasm...?) Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Phoenix: What? Mia did? Gumshoe: Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Godot profile Gumshoe: That's the guy who's gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey's retrial tomorrow. Phoenix: O-Oh, really? Gumshoe: He was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal. Phoenix: (Why's that guy so determined to see me fail?) Gumshoe: You sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind. Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything. Phoenix: It's OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right. Gumshoe: ... You know what? You're not such a bad guy after all, pal. Maggey Byrde profile Phoenix: Have you gone to see Maggey? Gumshoe: Of course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words. Phoenix: Oh... Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to. Phoenix: (Did he go for her, or for himself...?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: The chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Phoenix: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day. Phoenix: Under orders? Old Man: Yeah. You know, there's something about the lady... I mean, guy. Phoenix: Huh!? You can't stop thinking about him!? Gumshoe: Not like that, pal! Gimme a break! He's not my type. I mean, I can't stop thinking that he's involved with this case somehow! Phoenix: (Sounds like he knows a little something more about our charming chef.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you make of this...? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant... Phoenix: (You don't have to explain... Really...) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.: January 6Trés Bien Phoenix: The scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...) ???: Ah! Welcome! Bee avenue! Phoenix: (Wow. What a cute voice.) Maya: Oh, it's just you, Nick. Phoenix: M-Maya! Maya: Well? How do I look? Phoenix: ... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium... Maya: Maybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer. Phoenix: (Then who was that woman I just saw?) Maya: Oh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat! Phoenix: ... I am kind of hungry, actually. Talk Waitress Phoenix: So, how do you like your new job, Maya? Maya: I never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people's orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that. Phoenix: Yeah, it's a nice-looking restaurant. It's a shame more people don't come. Maya: Don't forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my \"gimme a tip\" smile! Lunch special Maya: Hey, Nick! Why don't you order something? The chef's preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says. Phoenix: How much is it? Maya: It's the Twin-T set. So it's 20 dollars, of course. Phoenix: The Twin-T set? I believe I'll be taking a pass. It's kind of expensive. Maya: What!? But you can't! Come on, Nick! It's not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register! Phoenix: How about cleaning the toilets? That should keep you busy. Maya: Yeah, right! Maybe later. Present Anything Phoenix: About this... Maya: Sorry, Nick! I'm a waitress now. I've got a pile of work waiting for little ol' me. After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um... About the lunch... Maya: Oh! A fine choice, sir. Phoenix: No. I, um... Maya: KITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT! Phoenix: I don't need any of that! Maya: Just a moment, please, sir. Phoenix: (Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya! Maya: Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set! Phoenix: Whoa! Maya: A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit! Phoenix: Um, thanks...? Maya: Come on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already! Phoenix: (Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp! Maya: Well? Phoenix: Are you hungry, Maya? Maya: I'm starving! Phoenix: Here. It's yours. Maya: Really!? ... Urp! Phoenix: Remember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate! Maya: ... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets! Phoenix: Hey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!) Trés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record. Phoenix: How does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad? Maya: Hey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen? Phoenix: (The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.) Talk Kitchen Phoenix: Hmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? \"In the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!\" Maya: In the kitchen? Mmm. That sounds tasty! Phoenix: Hey, wait up! Maya! Maya: What is it? I'm pretty busy right now. Phoenix: Weren't you going to show me around? Maya: Tsk. There goes my plan to find some cool clue and show it off in your face... Phoenix: (I'd better conduct the search in the kitchen myself!) After clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Trés Bien: January 6Trés BienKitchen Maya: And here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually. Phoenix: ... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure. Maya: Mr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop! Examine Mirror Maya: Now THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty. Phoenix: There's a book on the dresser. \"Claurice Armstrong's Bedtime Literature\". Maya: Not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it? Phoenix: It looks like a collection of poems he's written. Maya: Poems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK? Phoenix: OK, um... Here's one. Ahem! It's called, \"Printemps\". \"Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must.\" Maya: Huh? That's it!? Phoenix: Yup. That's a poem for you. Oil bottles Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: There's one bottle that's different from all the others. Phoenix: Well what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either. Maya: And... *sniff* It doesn't smell. Phoenix: (So what's that liquid inside then, I wonder?) Maya: Hey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he? Small Bottle added to the Court Record. Oil bottles (subsequent times) Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Lace curtains Phoenix: What are these lace curtains for? Maya: I don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those. Phoenix: (How do you respond to something like that!?) Table Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter! Maya: My Magatama! What's it doing there!? Phoenix: (What indeed...) Magatama put into pocket. Table (subsequent times) Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Maya: And look at these knives. They look really sharp! Phoenix: I'd like to see how one of those slices through a cheesecake. Maya: A cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick. Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I just ate for lunch? Maya: Maybe... What you ate is the only French dish I know the name of. After examining oil bottles in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Hey, you're just in time! Phoenix: What is it, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: The lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me. Phoenix: (He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything? Gumshoe: They said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it. Phoenix: (I expected as much...) Gumshoe: The victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment. Sports Paper refiled into the Court Record. Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal? Phoenix: (Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...) Talk Armstrong's secret (appears after presenting Small Bottle) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes... Gumshoe: So, how was it? Phoenix: To put it nicely... it was inedible. Gumshoe: Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so... Phoenix: Yeah... I guess it's probably the food. Gumshoe: The real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt. Phoenix: Really? How much does he owe? Gumshoe: This is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red. Phoenix: H-Half a million? Are we talking dollars? Gumshoe: Yeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble! Phoenix: Sorry. That figure just took me by surprise. Gumshoe: Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch. Jean's Loan Contract added to the Court Record. Armstrong's secret (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes... Gumshoe: So, how was it? Phoenix: To put it nicely... it was inedible. Gumshoe: Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so... Phoenix: Yeah...

That figure just took me by surprise. Gumshoe: Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch. Present Sports Paper Gumshoe: So according to the boys down at the lab, the doodles were probably made by the victim. Phoenix: Probably? Gumshoe: Analyzing this kind of writing is difficult since it's done with a fiber-tipped pen. But don't worry! I'll vouch for it. Phoenix: (Why would Gumshoe have to vouch for it? Can't it stand on its own?) Small Bottle Gumshoe: You got one of those aroma bottles too, huh? Phoenix: Only this one doesn't smell. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get you... Phoenix: This was mixed in with all the other aromatherapy bottles, but it's not the same. It doesn't even look the same, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: A cologne bottle that doesn't smell, huh? Smells like a skunk to me, pal! Mind letting me borrow that bottle for a while? I wanna send it to the lab for analysis. Phoenix: (The victim was poisoned, so the contents of this bottle are pretty important...) Small Bottle given to Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: I had a lunch there was something funny about that chef. Phoenix: You suspect Jean Armstrong? Gumshoe: I've got that guy's number. I know what his secret is. Phoenix: (That must be the same secret Gumshoe was talking about before.) Gumshoe: I guess I'd better fill you in on the details. About this Armstrong guy's secret, I mean... Jean's Loan Contract Gumshoe: It's for half a million dollars, pal! That's... um... half a million dollar bills! Phoenix: (What was the \"um\" in there for!?) Is there really that much money tied up in this case? Gumshoe: I can't give you an answer on that, pal. Not without the case file in front of me. But I'll tell you this... That Armstrong guy would've done anything for cash. He was desperate, you know? Phoenix: No, I don't. But I think I sort of get the picture. After examining table in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Vitamin Square Phoenix: Hmm, the old guy's not here anymore. (Drat. And I still have some unanswered questions for him.) Examine Motor scooter Leads to: \"A scooter, huh?\" Phoenix: A scooter, huh? Who'd leave it right in the middle of the park like this? The wheel guard and the light are busted... I guess it must have been in an accident. It's totally wrecked. ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!

Surely that guy wasn't my phony... was he...? ... He wasn't anything like me!! (Guess I better make a note of the scooter...) Scooter added to the Court Record. ???: Kah! Pathetic! Phoenix: Oh, it's you. Old Man: A few threats from a little brat like that... ...and you look like a pigeon that's got seeds in its eyes. Phoenix: Have you been here the whole time then? Old Man: I was in that strawberry. I had some thinking to do. Phoenix: (More like you had some cowering to do!) Talk Trés Bien regular Phoenix: Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir? Old Man: ... Phoenix: It's just if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it... This old guy has got something to hide. But what could it be?) Trés Bien regular (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Why are you a regular at a restaurant that you clearly hate, sir? Old Man: Take that, pigeons! See how you like these seeds! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (It's no good. I'm gonna have to break his Psyche-Lock. I just can't figure out what he would be hiding. I mean, I'm only asking him why he goes to a particular restaurant.) Trés Bien regular (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Um... Sir... Old Man: Yes, it's true! I was there for the young girl. Fine, so I'm a dirty, wicked, sinful old devil! Phoenix: No, no... I didn't mean it like that... Old Man: I even get one of those lousy cups of javaccino every time. For 8 dollars! All because of the serving girl! Punish me! Lock me up! Phoenix: Really, that's not what I'm here for. Old Man: You'll be the same! Another 20 years and you'll understand what it's like! You'll know how painful it is to be an old man like me! Phoenix: No, really. Listen, sir... Old Man: Stop calling me that! I have a name you know, boy! So show some respect, hmm!? I'm Victor Kudo. Phoenix: S-Sorry... Mr. Kudo. Kudo: You young ones think you know it all, don't you? Well, I'm not saying another word! I won't tell you anything more! Phoenix: (This guy was in the restaurant at the time of the incident. Which means I have to hear his testimony, one way or another!) Kudo: Hmph! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... I even broke his Psyche-Locks and everything... (Changed from [I don't believe this... I even broke his Psyche-Lock and everything...] in the original release) I guess I'll have to try to get him when he's in a better mood.) Any option (after breaking Psyche-Locks, then clearing \"Trés Bien regular\" Talk option) Phoenix: Mr. Kudo! Please! This is really important. Kudo: Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Hmm, pi-pi-pigeon, hmm... Kah! Phoenix: (Ack. He's really giving me the cold shoulder now. But this guy's an important witness. I can't afford to lose his testimony. There must be a way to soften him up...) Present Magatama (after clearing \"Trés Bien regular\" Talk option) Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Trés Bien regular -- Phoenix: It's time you told me the truth. Why are you a regular at a restaurant that you dislike so much? Old Man: Isn't it obvious!? People only have one reason to go to restaurants. To eat! Phoenix: To eat? Is that the whole truth? Old Man: Wh-What do you mean!? Phoenix: I don't think you go to that restaurant for the food at all. Old Man: You insolent brat! How dare you accuse me! What proof have you got!? Phoenix: I can tell that not you nor anyone else in the world would go to that place for its food. Present Lunch Special Phoenix: Leads to: \"The proof is in the pudding. Or in this case, the lunch menu.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? Old Man: Take this! Phoenix: Argh! Old Man: You're a disgrace! An idiot! A clot! A fool! You're only worthy of this pigeon feed! Phoenix: Ow! (Looks like that evidence wasn't it!) L-Listen... Leads back to: \"I don't think you go to that restaurant for the food at all.\" Phoenix: The proof is in the pudding. Or in this case, the lunch menu. Old Man: That's the Twin-T set!

I haven't done a jot of work since I was born. Other than feeding the pigeons. Phoenix: (What a load of crock!) Old Man: The taste's another story, but the price... It's nothing to me. Phoenix: So, you're saying that you go there because you've got money to burn? Old Man: Exactly! I have so much cash, I go for a swim in my money vault every day!

Old Man: What's your problem? You think a poor man would be better off drinking dishwater, do you? Is that it!? Phoenix: N-No. I wasn't thinking that. I was wondering if the coffee there is really that great... Old Man: No, it's not. But... But anyway! Yes! That place has free newspapers to read every day. Phoenix: Newspapers? Old Man: Exactly.

Leads back to: \"Tell me, why are you so determined to hide the truth?\" Old Man: Wh-What are you asking me about that girl for? Phoenix: She was the waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Ah! Phoenix: Therefore, the answer to the mystery... ...of why an old man would drink expensive coffee at a terrible restaurant... ...is the waitress! Old Man: Argh! B-But I don't recognize that face! Phoenix: And you are probably telling the truth here. Because you weren't looking at the girl's face... But at her outfit! Old Man: *gulp* Phoenix: That's the truth, isn't it? You became a regular at the restaurant because of the waitress's uniform! That uniform is all you can think about, isn't it? Old Man: Uh... uh... I-I can't take it...

Aaah, bitter! Judge: Mr... Um... Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor? Judge: Aaaah! Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong!? Judge: Nothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating. Phoenix: No, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix. Judge: I see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he? Phoenix: (\"Our trusty\"...?) Judge: So, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please. Godot: Mr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today. Phoenix: But I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright! Godot: I wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out. Phoenix: (There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!) Judge: As everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial. Phoenix: (I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!) Judge: Now then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness. Godot: Let's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation? Gumshoe: ... Judge: Witness! State your name for the court! Gumshoe: Huh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe. Godot: Other way around, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir! Judge: Since yesterday? Gumshoe: Yeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now. Maya: I hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake. Judge: I see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case? Gumshoe: Y-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report. Judge: The court accepts this into evidence. Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Um... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress. Judge: The waitress being the accused? Gumshoe: Yeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo. Judge: Hmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me. Trés Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record. Godot: Come, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands. Judge: Now then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony. Gumshoe: Umm... Yes, sir... Witness Testimony -- The Incident -- Gumshoe: When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir. We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time. Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup. And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch! And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive. Judge: Hmm... Godot: Using the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady! Judge: The facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but... Phoenix: Yes? Judge: Please, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood? Phoenix: I already told you! That wasn't me! Cross Examination -- The Incident -- Gumshoe: When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Can I stop you for just a minute? Gumshoe: Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence? Phoenix: (He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's what she said. And I-- Godot: Godot: What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction? Phoenix: Hey! Godot: Sadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Well, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way. Godot: Ha...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Trés Bien, Trite! Phoenix: ...! Godot: I have here in my possession a ticket. Phoenix: A ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.) Godot: Yes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen. Judge: This is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct? Godot: I think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table? Phoenix: Urk! Judge: It certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Can I stop you for just a minute? Gumshoe: Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence? Phoenix: (He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's what she said. And I-- Godot: Godot: What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction? Phoenix: Hey! Godot: Sadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table. Judge: Hmm... Gumshoe: We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He was listening to his radio, you say? Gumshoe: Yeah. He had a portable radio in his chest pocket. Maya: Maggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\". Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: And what was it that the victim was listening to on the radio, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Huh? How should I know? Phoenix: (Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.) Maya: This isn't going very well, is it...? Judge: Hmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used? Leads back to cross-examination Gumshoe: Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else? Gumshoe: Not sure I get you, pal. Phoenix: Was the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder? Gumshoe: If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance. Phoenix: So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper... Godot: Godot: Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite? Gumshoe: The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: It seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee? Gumshoe: Huh!? What do you mean? Phoenix: According to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!? Gumshoe: Oh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think-- Godot: Godot: In case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there. Gumshoe: Huh? For me? Godot: \"Oh, hey! You're right!\"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence. Gumshoe: Th... THAT piece... sir? Godot: Yes. THAT piece. Gumshoe: ... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again? Godot: This! Phoenix: (Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?) Gumshoe: Oh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup. Godot: Yes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim. Judge: Oh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it. Godot: Conclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this! Phoenix: Uuuurgh! Gumshoe: For the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's. Coffee Cup added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Upon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance... Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else? Gumshoe: Not sure I get you, pal. Phoenix: Was the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder? Gumshoe: If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance. Phoenix: So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper... Godot: Godot: Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite? Gumshoe: The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: It seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee. Gumshoe: And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: (Potassium cyanide? I've heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: It's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history. Maya: How much is too much? Godot: A lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off. Maya: 0.2 grams? How much is that? Gumshoe: You know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much. Phoenix: (Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...) Judge: Hmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere. Gumshoe: And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Some kind of a motive\"? Gumshoe: Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion. Godot: Godot: You know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get it. Godot: I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out. Gumshoe: *gulp* Godot: So stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive? Phoenix: (Come on, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: She was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket. Phoenix: I knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.) Gumshoe: It disappeared from the scene of the crime. Godot: And it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million! Maya: Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one... Phoenix: (Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Wait a minute! The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client! Godot: Ha...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question! Judge: Th-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...? Gumshoe: One of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant. Phoenix: WH-WHAAAAAT!? Judge: Order! Order! Godot: Ha...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress. Judge: Y-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately! Phoenix: (Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...) Victim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record. Judge: The ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...? Godot: It's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor. Phoenix: (And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey's person...] in the original release) Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Victim's Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Some kind of a motive\"? Gumshoe: Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion. Godot: Godot: You know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get it. Godot: I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out. Gumshoe: *gulp* Godot: So stick to the facts, Detective.

Maya: Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one... Phoenix: (Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?) Maya: You really think there are any contradictions in this testimony? Phoenix: To be honest, I don't know. Maya: But Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line? Phoenix: (I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.) After selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements: Judge: That's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime. Godot: I like an old man who knows the score. Judge: There is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules! Godot: I don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money. Maya: Not good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast. Phoenix: Yeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already. Godot: I'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence. Phoenix: (He's got more evidence against Maggey!?) Godot: This is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time. Maya: Wow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen... Phoenix: Th-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?) Godot: Ha...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself. Phoenix: The coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye... Godot: Of course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more. Judge: Something else? I presume you mean... Godot: Of course. I'm referring to the pocket. Phoenix: The... pocket? Godot: A search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket! Phoenix: A bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket? Gumshoe: Yeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it. Phoenix: WHAAAT!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence. Apron added to the Court Record. Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record. Judge: There's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court? Godot: Bloodstain? What bloodstain would that be? Judge: Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron! Godot: That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain! Phoenix: (You don't need to be told! Just look at it!) Godot: Well, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!? Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir. Phoenix: Ketchup!? Gumshoe: She must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day. Judge: ... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe! Godot: Pull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness! Gumshoe: Unnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already. Judge: Hmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case. Phoenix: ...! Judge: The motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established. Godot: Well, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all. Phoenix: (Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!) Judge: Witness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there. Witness Testimony -- The Investigation -- Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir. Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her. The victim didn't have any identification on him. But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly. When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison. And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene. Judge: Hmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good. Godot: Last chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite! Phoenix: ...! Godot: Don't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin! Cross Examination -- The Investigation -- Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Scary old man\", Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: There's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened. Phoenix: (Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...) Gumshoe: Officers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. \"What took you so long!?\" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds... Judge: Hmm... Seeds... Godot: Ha...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth. Phoenix: (I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...) Godot: The old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime. Gumshoe: Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How long was the defendant unconscious for? Gumshoe: The officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself. Phoenix: (I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...) Gumshoe: I woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful. Phoenix: (You're a professional detective, Gumshoe. Not a professional bird watcher!) Godot: Save the romantics for your own time, Detective. All we need to know about is the investigation. Gumshoe: Oops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I? Gumshoe: The victim didn't have any identification on him. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then? Gumshoe: No, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet. Phoenix: Fifty-eight cents...? Gumshoe: Yeah. I can't believe I found someone with less in their wallet than me, pal! Judge: The victim sounds like he was a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... Why not give him a bit of an edge? Phoenix: (I think I'm on to something here...) Gumshoe: But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...) Gumshoe: There was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket. Godot: It seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Trés Bien. Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?) Leave it Phoenix: (I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the prescription bag Phoenix: So what sort of medicine was in the bag? Gumshoe: Well... Actually, the bag we found was empty. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Yeah. Completely empty. Phoenix: (It was completely empty...?) Victim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record. Godot: Ha...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence? Desperate, are you, Trite? Phoenix: ...! Godot: Now, what happened with the investigation after that, Detective? Leads back to cross-examination Ask about his health insurance Phoenix: So, the victim had no form of identification on him, correct? Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: And yet, before arriving at the restaurant, he went to see a doctor. Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him! Judge: Oh! That is very true! Phoenix: The fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen! Godot: Ha...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with! Phoenix: Huh? Judge: Hmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... A bit of an edge never hurt anyone. Maya: Looks like we're off course again, Nick. Judge: Witness. Please continue with your testimony. Explain for the court the events following the preliminary investigation. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Victim's Prescription Bag is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...)

Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court. Gumshoe: When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But the defendant had been passed out for a while, correct? In that case... Isn't it possible someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket!? Gumshoe: Hey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal! Judge: Hmm... Gumshoe: It happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes! Godot: Godot: Keep up this crazy testimony, Detective, and those shoes will end up down your throat! Gumshoe: Sorry... Godot: So, Trite. \"Someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket\"...? That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence? Phoenix: Um... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...) Judge: It appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness. Gumshoe: And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for. Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: Interesting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh? Phoenix: (And they're just going to let him get away with it...?) Judge: It was just one dollar, Detective. Maya: I guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe. Present Victim's Prescription Bag Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you.\" Phoenix: If I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict! Maya: Gumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something! Phoenix: Yeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious. Maya: Come on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony. Gumshoe: Oho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you? Phoenix: You testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later? Gumshoe: Um, no. They didn't. Phoenix: The victim was given a prescription right before going to Trés Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!? Gumshoe: Y-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!! Judge: I-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!? Gumshoe: I, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh? Phoenix: The victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself! Judge: O-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that? Godot: Ha...! That's all. Phoenix: What!? Godot: Read for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will. Phoenix: What's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological? Judge: Just what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot? Godot: Hardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say. Judge: A war wound? Godot: The day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum. Phoenix: He ruptured his eardrum!? Judge: Then what on earth was the prescription he was given? Godot: It was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested! Phoenix: What!? Godot: It's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear. Judge: Yes. Here it is. In very, very fine print. Godot: It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication. Phoenix: Uuurgh... Judge: It seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all. Phoenix: N-No... Maya: Nick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over! Phoenix: (She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?) Push the medication issue Leads to: \"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\" Leave it Phoenix: It does seem as it the medication isn't connected to the case. Godot: Ha...! Maybe the last Mr. Trite was the real one. At least he didn't waste time. Judge: Indeed... If you have nothing further to add to this medication issue... ...the facts of this case seem no different to those presented on the last trial. I would therefore have no choice but to hand down my verdict. Phoenix: Uh... Umm...! Maya: Nick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground! Judge: Now then... Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Your Honor! Actually, this prescription... is absolutely pivotal to the case! Judge: Mr. Wright! Did you not just say the exact opposite only moments ago!? Phoenix: (Gotta lose a few battles in order to win the war, I suppose.) Leads to: \"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\" Phoenix: Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!? Godot: ...! Judge: But the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal! Phoenix: Phoenix: That doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth! Godot: Godot: You know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide. Phoenix: Phoenix: It hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable! Godot: Aaargh! Judge: That's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call? Godot: ... Judge: Mr. Godot...? Godot: ... Gumshoe: Um... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder. Phoenix: (Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?) Judge: Very well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me. Maya: Yay! Good job, Nick! Judge: The court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness. Godot: Ha...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups. Judge: Court is adjourned for recess! January 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Maya: Phew! That was close! Phoenix: Tell me about it... I nearly died in there! Byrde: That's my line, sir! Maya: No! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit. Byrde: Looks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!? Maya: Huh? Byrde: He said he'd help me. But he totally set me up! Phoenix: I don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right? Byrde: It's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again! Phoenix: (Poor Gumshoe...) Maya: So the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right? Phoenix: Yeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds! Byrde: I bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know? Maya: Yeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds! January 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: Court will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please. Godot: The prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand. Godot: Name and occupation, if you don't mind. Kudo: The name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too. Phoenix: We don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation. Kudo: My occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!? Phoenix: Kimono embroidery? Kudo: That's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed! Maya: Wow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime. Kudo: Anyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile! Phoenix: (That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...) Judge: Now then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident? Kudo: Oh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino. Judge: Seeds? Kudo: What do you think these are, hmm!? Judge: I-I see... Godot: So you saw everything that happened, gramps? Kudo: Did I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all! Godot: Then please, tell the court. We're all ears. Kudo: Sure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail! Phoenix: (He's really getting into this...) Witness Testimony -- What I Witnessed -- Kudo: The young man was reading the sports paper. The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed. That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well! Judge: Mr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress. Kudo: Kah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!? Judge: N-Newfangled? Kudo: All this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you! Judge: E-Excuse me... Kudo: Listen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away! Judge: Well, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Cross Examination -- What I Witnessed -- Kudo: The young man was reading the sports paper. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you saw the victim, then? You saw Mr. Glen Elg? Kudo: I wanted to know if Gusten Brawn retained his championship or not. Phoenix: (So he was looking at the sports paper the victim was reading, huh...) And at the location in question... ...there are partitions between tables on the same side of the restaurant, right? Kudo: So what if there are? Phoenix: If you say that you could see the victim... ...that means you were sitting at a table on the other side of the restaurant, correct? Kudo: Kah! I go to that place to drink javaccino! I don't go to sit! I don't remember what table I was sitting at! Phoenix: (You mean you go there to eye the waitress!) Kudo: The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw? Kudo: Victor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i! Phoenix: I see... Kudo: My eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving. Phoenix: (...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.) Kudo: And I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well! Phoenix: (I bet I know what's coming up and something tells me I'm not going to like it...) Leave it Phoenix: (It'd be dangerous to press this too much. I'd better ignore it for now.) So, what happened next? Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Your Honor. We need more clarification on what was put into the victim's coffee. I'd like to ask that the witness add what he knows about this to his testimony. Judge: Hmm... I agree. Witness, will you enlighten us, please? Kudo: Sure, sure. Adds statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\" Press (after adding statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw? Kudo: Victor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i! Phoenix: I see... Kudo: My eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving. Phoenix: (...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.) Kudo: And I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well! Kudo: There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: D-Did she really put that into the coffee? Kudo: You doubt me, boy!? She too some out of a small, brown bottle and sprinkled it in. Phoenix: Couldn't she have been adding sugar? Kudo: Sugar!? In a small, brown bottle like that!? Judge: \"Like that\"? Witness, could you please describe the bottle in more concrete terms? Godot: Ha...! A bottle like this, perhaps? Kudo: Oh, there it is! That's the one! Judge: That's the bottle of potassium cyanide, I presume? Godot: So what did the accused put into the coffee? I think it's clear, don't you? Phoenix: Argh... Kudo: The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He took just one sip? Kudo: You young'uns! You waste everything! Those javaccinos cost 8 dollars! In the good old days, we would have drank every last drop, eaten the cup, and then died! Phoenix: (Congratulations. You have earned the title of Battiest Man To Grace A Courtroom.) Godot: So it was an immediate death? Well, with potassium cyanide, I suppose that is possible. Kudo: Oh, yes. He slumped over without so much as a twitch! I felt the javaccino I'd just drank turn sour in my stomach. Godot: Oh, yes. I know that feeling. Judge: And the waitress? I presume she is...? Kudo: That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by? Kudo: Particular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is! Phoenix: Sorry? Kudo: You can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform! Phoenix: Phoenix: So the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me! Judge: Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image. Maya: Don't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together! Phoenix: (I-I guess I got a bit carried away...) Kudo: Kah! There are other things I recognize about her, too. Phoenix: (He seems pretty sure of himself. What should I do?) Leave it Phoenix: (There's got to be a better line of attack than this. That's what I should be looking for now...) Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Sure, you saw a waitress take the coffee over to the victim. But what matters is whether that waitress was Maggey Byrde or not. Judge: Quite right. Mr. Kudo. These other \"features\" that you recognize about the defendant... I would ask you to add them to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Adds statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\" Press (after adding statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by? Kudo: Particular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is! Phoenix: Sorry? Kudo: You can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform! Phoenix: Phoenix: So the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me! Judge: Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image. Maya: Don't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together! Phoenix: (I-I guess I got a bit carried away...) Kudo: Kah! There are other things I recognize about her, too. Kudo: There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (There's no doubt he remembers the waitress pretty well. What should I do? I get the feeling there's something more to this somehow...) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I must be imagining it. I need to find another angle with this guy.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the straps Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. You seem especially interested in straps. Why is that? Kudo: Wh-What? Phoenix: The ribbon in her hair, the straps on her apron. What's the fascination? Kudo: F-Fascination? Godot: Godot: People have all kinds of fetishes, Trite. We don't need to embarrass the witness. Kudo: Listen, you young upstarts! I haven't got some sick strap fetish! Judge: Hmm... Is there any relevance to the witness's unusual love of straps, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I was just curious as to why he was so fixated on the waitress's straps... Kudo: I said I haven't got a strap fetish! How many times do I have to repeat myself!? Judge: Very well. Continue with your testimony, Mr. Kudo. And make it strapless. Kudo: *grumble grumble* Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the waitress's back Phoenix: The identifying \"features\" you described are all things you would see from the back. Kudo: So what? Phoenix: Is it possible that... ...you never saw the waitress from the front at all!? Godot: Godot: Ha...! He's got you there, gramps! Phoenix: People normally talk about facial features when they're asked to describe someone. But this witness's testimony is nothing but straps and ribbons! Kudo: Th-This is harassment! I tell you I'm not obsessed with straps or ribbons! I'm just telling you what I saw! Judge: Mr. Kudo, the court requests that you add details about any identifying features... Features you observed from the front, that is, to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Maya: The old man's testimony is getting longer and longer! Phoenix: And if I can't find a hole in it soon, it'll get even longer, I bet. Adds statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\" Press (after adding statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm... Kudo: There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't find anything to be distinct, but you did clearly see the witness's face, yes? Kudo: No question about it! I didn't come this far to back down now! Victor Kudo never backs down! Phoenix: (That's not the answer I was looking for, but OK...) Maya: This has turned into a matter of pride for Old Seedy now, I guess... I wonder if he really did see Maggey's face or not... Phoenix: (Like I thought, we need some concrete proof of this. Proof that the old guy didn't see the waitress clearly from the front.) Present Apron Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\" Maya: Do you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it? Phoenix: Well, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there. Maya: But he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress... Phoenix: I-I guess... (Hmm, she makes a good point though...) Maya: Hey! Did I just say something clever? Phoenix: I wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw really was Maggey... Maya: That's what we have to figure out, Nick! Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this. Kudo: Kah! That filthy thing would suit filth like you just perfectly. Actually, it reminds me of what my grandson looks like, just after he's done eating. Phoenix: Have you ever seen this before? Kudo: Of course I haven't! Do you think I'd forget something as dirty as that!? Hmm? Well? You half-witted clot!? Phoenix: ... Judge: ... ......... Kudo: Wh-What!? What is it!? Ever since I said, \"you half-witted clot\", there's been an eerie silence in here. Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. This apron... ...is the apron worn by the defendant on the day of the poisoning! Kudo: Uh? Phoenix: And as you just said yourself... ...you wouldn't forget something like this. Which means, is you had really seen this apron before... Kudo: Er... Phoenix: Yes, you know what I'm getting at! You couldn't have possibly seen the waitress from the front! Kudo: ... Oops! Judge: Witness! You can't just \"oops\" your way out of this! Godot: Ha...! Well, well... Looks like we finally have a genuine trial on our hands. Phoenix: ... Godot: Listen, Trite. Here are the facts. On the day of the incident, there was only one waitress in the restaurant. Judge: That being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde? Godot: Exactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching! Judge: Hmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing. Godot: Just tell the court exactly what you saw, gramps. Kudo: You can rely on me, Captain! My noggin's in perfect working order. I can't remember a single occasion when I forgot what burger a customer wanted! Maya: He can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out... Judge: Very well. Let's test just how good your memory and attention to detail is, Mr. Kudo. Tell us what you remember about the victim. Witness Testimony -- About the Victim -- Kudo: He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles. He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages! The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well. Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino. The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip. Judge: The testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail. Kudo: Oh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything! Maya: How are we going to handle this, Nick? Phoenix: We only need to do one thing. We just need to prove that the old man's memory is shot. Maya: Just trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel? Phoenix: (I suppose... But it's what I do best.) Cross Examination -- About the Victim -- Kudo: He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Spectacles? Kudo: Dark glasses to you! One of the lenses was green, but the other was broken. Newfangled rubbish! That's why I remember him so well. Phoenix: (He did have some kind of lens over his left eye... But I wouldn't have called it a pair of glasses.) Judge: Hmm... He seems to have been wearing some rather modern-looking shades. Perhaps I should take to wearing some, and rival Mr. Godot's sharp appearance. Maya: Ah! We better come up with something sharp, and quick! Phoenix: (Guess I'll wait and see if I should challenge him about the \"spectacles\"...) Kudo: He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The newspaper was a sports paper, was it? Kudo: That young hooligan! I nearly asked him, \"Can't you even read without fidgeting, hmm!?\" How was I supposed to be able to read the back page with all that rustling going on!? I needed to find out if Gusten Brawn retained his championship title! Phoenix: (It was his paper, not yours! If you wanted to know so bad, why didn't you buy your own!?) Kudo: What are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? How dare you judge me! Phoenix: Ow! Ooow! Maya: Gusten Brawn got beaten yesterday, by the way. Anyway... Kudo: The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The wireless? Kudo: The decadent young rascal! In my day, it was one or the other! Read the paper, or listen to the wireless! Phoenix: (...Oh boy.) Kudo: And using an earpiece! It's selfish, that's what it is! I was straining my ears, but I couldn't catch any of it. Phoenix: (Was he that desperate to listen to the radio...?) Kudo: What are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? 2 you feel sorry for me! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Kudo: Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean the waitress, who you only saw from behind, right? Kudo: You're one of those, are you? You never let anything go, isn't that right? Phoenix: ...Maybe. Kudo: What does it matter if I saw her from the front or from behind!? My eyes don't lie! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! (I better not push it until I've got some hard evidence.) Kudo: The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"His free hand\"? Kudo: Yes. Phoenix: Which hand was that? Kudo: Weren't you listening before, cloth-ears!? I said he was rustling the newspaper with his right hand, didn't I? If his free hand wasn't his right hand, then which hand was it, you moron! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Godot: Ha...! Perhaps the great Mr. Trite has three hands! Phoenix: (Yeesh! I was only asking! No need to gang up on me and treat me like a freak!) Present Coffee Cup Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony?\" Phoenix: (The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.) Maya: I guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh? Phoenix: (Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!) Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony? That this was a way of testing the credibility of your memory? Kudo: I know, I know! There's nothing wrong with my memory, I tell you! Nothing! If I got anything wrong, I'll eat these seeds and sing the pigeon song! Godot: Care to tell us where this is going, Trite? Phoenix: According to Mr. Kudo, the victim was holding the paper in his right hand... ...while drinking coffee with his free hand, which would make that his left. Kudo: Kah! What is this? Kindergarten? Phoenix: But I would like the court to please take a look at this. Judge: That's the cup victim used, correct? Phoenix: Yes, and on the rim, you'll notice the mark left by the victim's lips. Judge: Yes. There is a stain left by the coffee. Phoenix: If you consider where that stain is, you'll clearly see... ...that the victim was holding the cup in his right hand! Kudo: But how...? Phoenix: Well, Mr. Kudo. The court is waiting for your epic performance! You said you'd eat those seeds and sing the pigeon song! Kudo: Aaaargh! Judge: Mr. Kudo... I'm afraid this is simply not acceptable. I think the witness had better go back to the park where he came from. Kudo: WAAAAIT! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to you tell me I'm mad, you're wrong! I don't care about that dirty coffee cup! I know what I saw! Judge: Y-You still insist on your testimony? Kudo: That young brat was holding the cup in his left hand! Oh, yes. No question! I'm a good, law-abiding citizen, I am. It's that dead young hotbot and you, you spikey-haired yahoo, who are at fault! Phoenix: (Who, me!?) Judge: Th-Thank you, old man. We've heard quite enough from you already. Kudo: Don't call me \"old man\", old man! Been around for 68 years, I have. You can't ignore me! LISTEN TO WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAAAAY! Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but... Godot: Sure, why not hear a little more? Judge: M-Mr. Godot! Godot: But this is my 16th cup of coffee... So this is your final stand. Kudo: Thank you, Captain! You can rely on Victor! Witness Testimony -- Left Hand or Right Hand -- Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs. He kept fiddling with it all the time. He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too. And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand! Judge: We know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye. Godot: It wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers. Judge: A monitor? You mean, like a television screen!? Godot: The inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work. Kudo: HDTV, DVD, CD... All these newfangled letters drive me mad! But they don't matter. I know what I saw, and I'm telling the truth! Phoenix: (It's true... He doesn't seem to be lying.) Kudo: And those are the facts, in good old black and white! Cross Examination -- Left Hand or Right Hand -- Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the victim was wearing an HMD. Kudo: HDTV, CD, DVD... What does it matter!? Phoenix: (It was none of them actually, but anyway...) And you're sure that he was wearing the earpiece on the same side? Kudo: No question! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting. Phoenix: (Yeah. That's pretty obvious if you look at the floor plans. From the opposite table, he'd only have a view of the side of the victim's head.) Present Victim's Prescription Bag or Glen Elg profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but...\" Kudo: He kept fiddling with it all the time. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: It seems you kept an eye on Mr. Glen Elg. Kudo: He was getting on my nerves! Rustling that newspaper and fiddling with his earpiece all the time! And then he went and made all that fuss dying from one sip of javaccino! I wanted to say to him, \"Calm down, you young brat!\" Just looking at him made me suddenly speed up my seed eating! I could've chocked! Phoenix: (So I take it the victim was a walking ball of nervous energy...) Kudo: He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The earpiece you mentioned... Which hand did the victim touch it with? Kudo: ... You're one of those people! One of those people who uses his left hand to get things out of his right pocket. Or fastens his left cuff with his right hand? And when the tour guide says, \"On your right side, you'll see the famous blah-blah\"... ...you're the only one who deliberately looks left! Well? Aren't you? Phoenix: N-No! I didn't mean... Kudo: Obviously he used the hand on the same side of his body that the earpiece was in! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Ow! (So, if he had the HMD on his left side, then it was his left hand, I guess...) Kudo: And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You seem very sure of yourself, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: That's because I know what I saw, no matter what tricks you try to play on me! Phoenix: (It looks like he really did see the guy picking the cup up with his left hand. This is a dead end!) Maya: Well, Nick? What do you think? Phoenix: I think the guy's telling the truth. But even so... Something's not quite right. Maya: Then chuck evidence at him until he breaks! Phoenix: (But if he's not lying, there wouldn't be any contradictions in his testimony, right?) Phoenix: I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but... Mr. Kudo! There is something very strange about your observations of the victim. Kudo: What!? Phoenix: You say he was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the HMD. Kudo: No question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting. Phoenix: I don't think so. Kudo: Wh-What did you say!? Phoenix: You're no doubt unaware of this fact, Mr. Kudo. But the victim couldn't hear with his left ear! His eardrum was ruptured! Kudo: Eh? Phoenix: Traces of medication for his condition were found in his ear canal. That's right! It's impossible that the victim was wearing his earpiece in his left ear. Because he couldn't even hear in that ear! Kudo: ... Is that true, Captain? Godot: ...It is. Kudo: ...Pi... Pi-Pi-Pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Pretty pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Judge: Order! Order! Order! Phoenix: This witness's testimony is completely unreliable! He only saw the witness from behind. And he claims the victim was wearing an earpiece when we know his eardrum was ruptured! Well, Mr. Godot!? Godot: Aaaargh! A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup! The old man... ...is my drop of milk! Kudo: Captain! Are you calling me a drip!? Judge: This is the victim's coffee cup in which the potassium cyanide was found. The mark on the rim clearly shows that the victim picked it up with his right hand! Kudo: I'll never back down! I know I'm right! The lad drank his javaccino with his left hand! Godot: Let me put you out of your misery... Clearly, the victim used both hands. He took a sip with the cup held in his right hand, and then switched to his left... That's what the old man saw! Phoenix: Phoenix: Impossible! The witness has already testified on numerous occasions... ...that the victim died immediately after taking just one sip of the coffee. Godot: Godot: Which hand the victim used to pick up his cup is irrelevant, Your Honor. The facts still stand! With one hand or the other, Mr. Elg drank the poisoned coffee... ...Like this! Phoenix: Phoenix: Sadly, Mr. Godot, that doesn't wash! The point of this testimony was to establish whether the witness's memory was credible. And the results are clear! The testimony given by this witness is useless! Godot: Puuuurgh! Judge: I believe it is time to conclude today's proceedings. I am satisfied that the witness is not deceiving the court. But to be frank, his testimony is a farce! Kudo: D-Did you have to be so frank!? Take that, you pompous old fogey! Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo. You can't reach me from there. I'm ordering the defense and the prosecution to investigate this case further. That is all for now. This court is adjourned! ???: Kudo: WAAAAIT! If we stop now, where does that leave me? Judge: Leave you, Mr. Kudo? Kudo: Thanks to that blue-suited young upstart over there... ...I'm just a bumbling old man who can't even dot his t's or cross his i's now! Phoenix: (How is your bad memory my fault!?) Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but there's nothing I can do. Kudo: I've kept my mouth shut until now... ...but there's something else the court should know! Godot: What!? Phoenix: There's more? Kudo: To be perfectly honest, it might not be anything. But I want another chance! I want another crack at you, you young shark! Phoenix: M-Me? (He's looking at me like I'm some sort of evil Shogun...) Kudo: Well, everyone? What do you say to one final showdown? The final chapter in this eccentric old man's scrapbook! Godot: Sorry, gramps... I've already had my 17th cup of coffee. Kudo: What have you got to lose, Captain? I'll give you all the javaccino you want if you come to my house after the trial. (Changed from [I'll give you all the coffee you want if you come to my house after the trial.] in the original release) I may be 68 years old, but Victor Kudo is still a man! Judge: That's enough, witness. I believe it will be quicker for the court to just hear your testimony. Kudo: You bet! Much, much quicker! Maya: I can't believe this is happening... Kudo: Ha ha ha! You better get ready, youngster! Phoenix: I get the picture! Just quit throwing those seeds at me, would you!? (He's gotta be using some sort of infinite ammo code with that box of seeds...) Witness Testimony -- The Final Showdown -- Kudo: First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself. The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino... Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over. It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked! Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm? Judge: ... Um... Is that all? Kudo: Yes, that's all. I remember it perfectly. Eh!? You're doubting me again? You're doubting a poor, defenseless old man!? Judge: N-No. We are not doubting you, Mr. Kudo. Maya: Don't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick? Phoenix: Yeah. \"So what?\" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy! Kudo: You're a birdbrain, that's why that's all you can think of! Judge: Very well... Mr. Wright. Your final cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- The Final Showdown -- Kudo: First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Um... The court generally prefers if witnesses are sure of themselves, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Noisy brat! I'm warning you, I'm more savage than a macho man right now! You won't beat me with this testimony! This is the final battle! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! (He's chucking those seeds harder than ever! I better be careful...) Maya: Come on, Nick! Nail him! Kudo: The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The court has already heard that testimony, Mr. Kudo... Kudo: I know that! I was just setting the mood. How else am I supposed to build up the suspense, hmm!? Phoenix: The suspense? Kudo: Isn't it enough? Should I work the audience a bit more? Judge: No, no! Please continue, Mr. Kudo. As quickly as possible! Kudo: Alright. Now where was I...? ...Ah yes. The young boy slumped over the table, and... Kudo: Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A vase, you say? Kudo: Yes. There are vases on all the tables in that place. They're accidents waiting to happen! They're practically begging to be knocked over! Phoenix: (Well, he's right about there being vases. I do remember seeing them, too... There was a vase on the table when I ate munch there.) And you saw the moment when the victim actually knocked over the vase? Kudo: Well... it's hard to say... It's a bit unclear... How do you really define... Phoenix: OK, I get it. Kudo: I heard it break! And the sight of it is burned into my memory as clear as day! Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\" Kudo: It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Soaked in water, you mean? Kudo: Yes. It splashed me on the knee as well. Phoenix: You said you were sitting at a table across the room from the victim, correct? And yet, the water still managed to splash onto you? Kudo: ... It was cold! I clearly remember it splashing me! Phoenix: (Could the water really make it all the way across to the other side of the room...?) Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\" Kudo: Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean, the vase on the victim's table falling upside-down and breaking? Kudo: The vase turned upside-down, and my testimony's turning this case upside-down... It's a joke! I just wanted everyone to hear it! What do you think, Captain!? Godot: ...I'm impressed. By your ability to waste time. Phoenix: (Godot hasn't raised any objections for a while now...) Kudo: So, you young show-off! With that scrap of information, I'm throwing down the gauntlet! If I lose this one, I'll take it like a man and admit defeat! Phoenix: He's really giving you the evil eye, Maya. Maya: It's you he's looking at, Nick, not me! It's like he's saying, \"I triple dog dare you to find a contradiction, young'un!\" Phoenix: I guess I'll just have to rise to the challenge then... Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene. Kudo: Hmph! So what? Phoenix: Look carefully at the table. The vase is there... intact! Kudo: Huh? Phoenix: Lost your tongue, granddad? Kudo: ... I'm no granddad of yours, hop scotch! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Judge: Enough! If you throw any more seeds in this courtroom, the cleaners will be here all night. Kudo: Aaaaaah! Judge: ... What is it now? Kudo: I just remembered something! Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Go on... Kudo: The broken vase... Ha ha! It was on my table! Phoenix: Wha...? Kudo: Ah, well... You see... It startled me when that young lad collapsed. So I stood up. That must've been when it fell over. The vase on my table, I mean. Judge: The vase on your table? Kudo: Ah ha ha! Yes, it was on my table! And that's how my groin came to be completely soaked. ......... Judge: *sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today. Kudo: Er, I'd like to ask a question now. Have I, er... Have I been any use at all? Judge: Perhaps that's something you should reflect on yourself, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Aaaargh! WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else... Judge: Bailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom! Kudo: WAAAIT! LISTEN TO MEEEEEE! Judge: Well! We seem to have been considerably sidetracked. And I am still not in a position to deliver a verdict. Phoenix: ...! Judge: The defendant has not been positively identified as the waitress in question. Additionally, there are two disparities in the testimony we have heard thus far. Phoenix: The mark on the coffee cup that the victim supposedly drank from with his left hand. And the earpiece which was inserted into his left ear, out of which he couldn't hear. Maya: Wow, Nick! You did it! Judge: I therefore require both the defense and the prosecution to further investigate the facts. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Godot: ... Judge: There is one more thing before I call today's session to an end. Phoenix: O-One more thing, Your Honor? Judge: The witness we just heard from... He is most insistent that his testimony should be of use. So he's summarized it accordingly into this statement. Phoenix: Um... OK... Judge: You may each have a copy of it, if you wish. Godot: Whatever. The prosecution doesn't need props like that. Maya: Godot's really mad, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. I would be, too. Judge: Very well. Here you are then, Mr. Wright. There are 3 copies. My own, yours, and Mr. Godot's. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Victor's Testimony added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (\"I'm sorry\"? This isn't a piece of testimony! More like a five year old's apology...) Maya: What the heck are we supposed to do with 3 copies...? Judge: That is all. This court is adjourned! To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned! Recipe for Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 January 7, 12:52 PMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: So how do you think the trial went this morning? Phoenix: How do you think it went!? Maya: It got a bit crazy in there. I just wonder if that killed our chances. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess it did get out of hand. Mr. Kudo's testimony did nothing to help us. Plus, now we don't even know the identity of the waitress who laced the coffee. Maya: All we know is what old Mr. Kudo saw... The apron straps, and the ribbon. Phoenix: And that the victim was wearing an earpiece when his eardrum was ruptured. Maya: Talk about a terrifying case of contradictionitus. Phoenix: Time to play doctor and find ourselves a cure then, huh? Maya: Yeah, we've gotta find one for Maggey, or she's going to have a terminal case of guilty! Talk What to do Phoenix: Well? I'm officially at a loss as to where to start. Maya: Yeah, me too. Let's try some brainstorming. You go first. Phoenix: I guess we should try to put Mr. Kudo's testimony to some sort of use. Maya: Yeah, that's true. Phoenix: And we need to figure out the identity of the waitress and who the victim really was... Somehow, I think the key to this case has got to be at Trés Bien. Maya: Well then, let's go back there and check it out again. Oh! And we should drop in on Maggey and see how she's doing, too. Any ideas Phoenix: So... Anything on your mind? Maya: Actually, there is something... Phoenix: ...? Maya: I was wondering about Xin Eohp... You know, like what he's like and stuff. Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I almost forgot about that guy. ???: I atta beat you so hard, it'll feel like youse were smoochin' the express train! ???: Phoenix Wright? Youse sayin' YOU' Phoenix Wright? ???: Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only! Phoenix: Actually... I've learned a little something about my doppelganger. Maya: Huh? You did? What did you find out? Phoenix: (Oh, yeah, Maya was working at the restaurant when I ran into Don Foneeonay...) Let's just say he was such a terrible version of me that I wanted to sue for defamation! (What's that guy's story, anyway? What does he have to gain by impersonating me?) Present Attorney's Badge Maya: That badge is totally useless, Nick. Phoenix: Huh!? Maya: I mean, no one suspected that Xin Eohp wasn't a real lawyer. I bet he didn't have an attorney's badge! Phoenix: ...I guess you're right. Maya: Or maybe he did have one! And maybe he switched your real one for a \"fugazzi\"! Phoenix: My badge? A fake!? ... Ha ha ha... That's a good one, Maya... Maya: Why the nervous laughter? ...Aha! I knew it! Your badge really IS fake, isn't it Nick? Sports Paper Maya: This doodle here... It was drawn by the victim, right? Phoenix: This is a newspaper from the day of the incident, so, yeah, we've got to assume so. There must be a clue in there somewhere. Maya: I guess we should show it around and see if anyone can tell us more about it. Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe there's a fake Nick running around. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. What's the deal with that? Why's he impersonating me? Maya: Maybe he's got something against you. People do tend to have a distinct distaste for you, Nick. Phoenix: (True enough... The only thing prosecutors seem to like about me is pushing me around...) Maya: Or... maybe he's got something against Maggey. Phoenix: (So he pretended to be me to get Maggey convicted?) Scooter Maya: That thing must've been in an accident. It's a total wreck! Phoenix: That's what the guy I met at the park was riding. And I'm betting he's the fake me. ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only! Phoenix: His voice is still ringing in my ears. Maya: Introduce me next time, Nick! I want to meet Xin Eohp, too! Jean's Loan Contract Maya: A loan of half a million dollars! I wonder what Mr. Armstrong did to get into that much debt. Phoenix: I'm going to guess he spent money needlessly. You'd better watch your spending, too. Maya: Hey, I've got a great idea! What if Mr. Armstrong charged $20,000 for the Twin-T set? Phoenix: If you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back! Victor's Testimony Maya: A letter of apology from the old man? Aww, how sweet. Phoenix: Actually, it's his \"testimony\"... If you can call it that. Maya: So? What's it say? ...\"I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry.\"? Heh heh! I used to break things all the time when I was little, you know. And I used to have to write apologies all the time, too. Phoenix: (Well, Pearls and Adrian seem to have picked up where you left off...) Coffee Cup Maya: That's the cup the poison was in, isn't it? Phoenix: Yeah, and the stain on the rim shows that the victim used his right hand to pick it up. Maya: But the old man swore he saw the victim pick it up with his left hand... Phoenix: (If Mr. Kudo wasn't mistaken, then what could account for this contradiction...?) Victim's Lottery Ticket Maya: Maybe I should try the lottery sometime, too. Phoenix: Sure, why not? If you hit the jackpot, you could win half a million bucks. Maya: So, what are you waiting for, Nick? Buy one! Phoenix: No way! Don't you know the lottery is a tax on people who are bad at math! Maya: Blah. Fine then. At least I can add it to the newly renamed \"Paths to Wealth\"! I'll have to call Pearly later and have her add, \"Buy lottery tickets whenever possible.\" Apron Maya: It's almost surreal that this artsy apron is what got us this far. Phoenix: Well, as art goes, this piece definitely leaves an impression. Maya: I guess that means the old guy never saw the front of it, huh? Which means he didn't see the waitress's face, either... Potassium Cyanide Maya: I can't believe they found this in Maggey's pocket. Phoenix: Yeah, but she was passed out, right? So the killer could've easily planted it on her. Maya: Where do you even get a hold of something like this? It's not like you can go down to your local CostMo' and buy it in bulk for $5 a pound! Phoenix: (She has got a point... How the killer got a hold of this poison is pretty important.) Victim's Prescription Bag Maya: \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\". Hmm... I guess if your eardrum was ruptured, you couldn't listen to the radio, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. It'd be pretty pointless to wear an earpiece of any kind. Maya: The medication in the bag is missing too, right? Phoenix: (The mysterious vanishing medication... Much like our mysterious \"other person\"...) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since then. I think Mia said it's because Maya's \"at a loss these days\"...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia really bailed me out again yesterday. Maya: Argh! That seedy old man was so rude to me! He didn't realize just how awesome I am. If he had, I bet he would've treated me better. Phoenix: Since when did you become so awesome? Godot profile Maya: Godot got it good today, huh? He was even smoking at me end there! Phoenix: He'll have a new witness ready for tomorrow, though. You can count on it. (We need to figure out the facts before then, or we're doomed!) Maggey Byrde profile Maya: A lot of strange conflicting things kept popping up today in the trial, huh? Phoenix: Yeah, and they seemed to come out of nowhere. Maya: That's why we've gotta go talk with Maggey and get out this whole thing straightened out! Phoenix: (Maggey said that when she brought the victim his coffee... ...there was one more people sitting at the table. This single contradiction is probably the most important one we have to resolve...) Glen Elg profile Maya: Have you noticed the victims in our cases tend to be people we know nothing about, Nick? Take Glen Elg, for example. Phoenix: Now that you mention it... Maya: We don't know what kind of guy he was, or why he was killed. I say it's time to get out there and find some answers! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: I really felt sorry for Gumshoe today. He really wanted to help Maggey out, but he kept getting backed into a corner. Phoenix: Maggey took it pretty bad, didn't she? Do you think she feels betrayed? Maya: Maybe. We've got to cheer her up somehow. She's a friend, after all. Phoenix: (A friend? Hmm... Never really thought of it that way, but I guess she is.) Victor Kudo profile Maya: It's the seedy old man! What's his name again? Phoenix: Vermin Kudo, is it? I can't remember, either. I've never seen a witness mess up so badly in court before. Maya: Better stay away from him a while, huh? Phoenix: (Yeah. It might be more than seed that he chucks at me next time.) Jean Armstrong profile Maya: The chef's a witness too, right? Phoenix: I suppose so. He was in the kitchen at the time of the incident. Maya: Well, since Old Man Seeds's testimony is pretty much useless to us... ...I guess we should speak to Mr. Armstrong again, huh? January 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: Looks like Gumshoe's not here. Phoenix: Never mind that. What's going on? It feels different in here somehow... Maya: You think? Phoenix: Yeah. Everyone seems to be on edge. Detective: What are you doing!? Call in the officers for the briefing, quick! Can't you shut down the station's server? Chief! Quit playing on the Internet! Chief: But my e-mail pen pal, 1337aZnPrInceSz! Detective: Save it for later! I'm turning it off NOW! Chief: Noooo! 1337aZnPrInceeeeeSz!! Maya: Everyone's keeping busy in here, huh? Phoenix: Keeping busy? More like panicking, if you ask me. (Something's going on. Something big...) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Even pickpockets can have their pockets picked.\" That's a keeper! Better to go with something that doesn't sound too much like a slogan. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a crime prevention campaign... ...But I'm not sure even he knows what kind of crime he's trying to prevent. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut. Chief: Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to write her a real letter instead of an email. Phoenix: (Alternately, you could write up some reports... Just a suggestion.) Chief: \"Dear 1337aZnPrInceSz, How are you? I'm OK! How was the show last night...?\" Maya: Wow, what an awesome job! Maybe I should send in my resume and become chief! Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\"! Right, Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Um... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: I guess Maggey's still in questioning. Maya: But! But we've got questions to ask her, too! Magg-ey! Magg-ey! Phoenix: Keep it down, Maya! This isn't a playground, you know! January 7Trés Bien Maya: Empty, as usual. Phoenix: Yeah, and it's lunchtime, too. ???: That's it! Come on, come on, come on! Phoenix: Hey, that sounds like... Gumshoe: Now just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can! Maya: He's getting really worked up about something. Gumshoe: Noooooo! That's the wrong number! Argh! Look like an \"8\" would have only netted me five bucks anyway! What a rip off! Maya: What's the problem, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Huh!? Oh, it's you... I, uh... I was uh... Hah hah! I was just... Hah hah hah! I was just listening to the radio, pal. Phoenix: To the radio? Maya: Hey, Detective Gumshoe's having lunch here! Phoenix: (He is! And he's having the Twin-T set...) Gumshoe: Aha ha ha... What can I say...? Examine Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Maya: It could say \"Entrance\" or \"Exit\", too. Did you think of that? Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: Hey, Nick. Do you think Old Seedy was talking about a vase like this today in court? Phoenix: It does look like it's ready to fall over any second. Looks kind of fragile, too. Maya: I bet if Mr. Armstrong charged 10,000 dollars for every vase a customer broke... ...he'd be able to pay off his loan really quickly. Phoenix: If you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got ya! I was just kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Maya: Wow, you really can't see the table in front or behind you at all! It's the perfect setup for slipping poison into your enemy's coffee. Talk Today's trial Gumshoe: This is a nightmare! How am I supposed to look Maggey in the eye now, pal!? Maya: You really drove her into a corner, you know. Gumshoe: You always blow apart my testimony! Why, of all days, didn't you do it today!? Phoenix: S-Sorry... There just weren't any holes in it... for once! Maya: Yeah, what happened? Usually, your testimonies are like Swiss cheese! Gumshoe: S-Swiss cheese...? Phoenix: (Would he have preferred, \"crumbly like aged parmesan\"? Anyway, this case has already been ruled on. There shouldn't be any holes left to find.) Gumshoe: So... Did Maggey say anything to you? About me, I mean. Maya: Well, um... How did she put it again...? Byrde: I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again! Maya: Something like that. Gumshoe: Wah... Waaaaaaaaaah! Maya: P-Please! Detective Gumshoe! I didn't mean... Gumshoe: Why!? Why is this happening!? Maya: He's banging his head against the wall, Nick! Phoenix: (Oh, man... Poor Gumshoe...) Lunch special Phoenix: So, did you like the Twin-T set? Gumshoe: I've never paid that much money for lunch before. I was so nervous, my hands were shaking. Maya: So? How did it taste!? Gumshoe: Well... For 20 bucks, I guess... I dunno how to describe it, really. It was... delicate. Maya: Delicate? Phoenix: You mean you liked it!? It didn't taste bad to you? Gumshoe: ... Maya: What's the matter with him? Phoenix: Looks like he's thinking... Gumshoe: ... That's it! I've been trying to think of the right word to describe the taste. I just got it right now... \"Bad\"! That's it. It tasted bad! Phoenix: *sigh* Gumshoe: It's kinda hard to admit it to yourself when you pay 20 bucks though, pal. Phoenix: (Maybe he should've found out about the price AFTER he had finished eating...) Maya: Maybe that's why Glen Elg came here. Maybe he heard about the famous Twin-T set! Phoenix: (Glen Elg, the victim, huh... Which reminds me. We still hardly know anything about the guy.) Maya: Why don't we ask Gumshoe what he knows, seeing as he's here? The radio Maya: So what were you all excited about earlier? Gumshoe: Huh? Phoenix: That's right! You said you were listening to the radio or something. Gumshoe: Oh, that? That was nothing! I-I wasn't excited! Maya: Come on, Detective Gumshoe! You can tell little ol' me! What were you listening to? Gumshoe: N-Nothing, really. It was just the, um... \"Daily Exercise Show\"! 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (What the...!? A Psyche-Lock?) Gumshoe: Hah hah hah! Mmm... This lunch special's lobster is great! Maya: Then why are there tears in your eyes...? The radio (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Lock) Maya: Come on, Detective Gumshoe. You can tell us what you were listening to on the radio. Gumshoe: But I already told you. It was the, um... the... weather forecast, pal. Phoenix: (Didn't you say it was an exercise program earlier!?) 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Gumshoe: It was nothing, really. Hah hah hah! Phoenix: (Even if it's nothing, the fact that he's hiding it makes me really curious!) The radio (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Gumshoe: I'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try. Phoenix: What's with everyone and the lottery...? Maya: So? How did it go? Gumshoe: I won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad! Phoenix: (Yeah, I know the feeling.) Gumshoe: I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg, see. (Changed from [I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg.] in the original release) And they've got this special radio show where they announce the winning numbers. (Changed from [When they read those results out on the radio, it really gets your heart pumping!] in the original release) They even do the drawings live on the air! It's intense, pal! (Changed from [You know they broadcast it live when they're picking the numbers? It's intense, pal!] in the original release) Maya: I bet that's what Mr. Elg was listening to on the day he was killed. (Changed from [I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.] in the original release) Phoenix: Yeah. What time is it now? Gumshoe: Uh, it's... It's just after 1:30. Phoenix: And are the lottery results always broadcast at the same time? Gumshoe: Yeah. Look, I got this flyer when I bought the ticket. Millionaire Radio Flyer added to the Court Record. Maya: \"Millionaire Radio\"? That sounds cool! I want to try it, Nick! Phoenix: Then buy a ticket, Maya. With your own money! The radio (subsequent times) Gumshoe: I'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try. Phoenix: What's with everyone and the lottery...? Maya: So? How did it go? Gumshoe: I won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad! Phoenix: (Yeah, I know the feeling.) Gumshoe: I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg, see. (Changed from [I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg.] in the original release) And they've got this special radio show where they announce the winning numbers. (Changed from [When they read those results out on the radio, it really gets your heart pumping!] in the original release) They even do the drawings live on the air! It's intense, pal! (Changed from [You know they broadcast it live when they're picking the numbers? It's intense, pal!] in the original release) Maya: I bet that's what Mr. Elg was listening to on the day he was killed. (Changed from [I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.] in the original release) I want to try it, Nick! Phoenix: Then buy a ticket, Maya. With your own money! Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? Gumshoe: It tells me the guy is cruising for a bruising! Maya: You're really caring, aren't you, Detective Gumshoe? About Maggey, I mean. Magatama (after clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, before breaking Psyche-Lock) Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- The Radio -- Phoenix: Alright, Detective Gumshoe, tell me the truth. What were you listening to? Gumshoe: No way, pal. Now that you've made a big thing out of it, I'm not gonna tell you... Phoenix: We'll see about that, pal. Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening... ...it's pretty clear what kind of radio program it was. I'd say it was related to... Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm right, aren't I?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Detective Gumshoe!? Gumshoe: Yeah! That's it, pal! You got me. You sure are something! Phoenix: (Then how come I'm still seeing the lock? Guess I was wrong... Now, what was it he shouting when he was listening to the radio...?) Gumshoe: That's it! Come on, come on, come on! Gumshoe: Now just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can! Gumshoe: Noooooo! That's the wrong number! Phoenix: (It seems so obvious... I'd better ask him again.) Gumshoe: D-Don't tell me you're not through yet... Leads back to: \"Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening...\" Phoenix: I'm right, aren't I? You were listening to the lottery results, weren't you? You thought you'd try to win big, just like Glen Elg did! Gumshoe: I-It's... It's like you can see right through me! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (Huh? I've cracked him already...?) Gumshoe: That's why I said it was nothing! Unlock Successful Sports Paper Gumshoe: That's the sports paper the victim wrote something in, right? ... Maya: What is it? Gumshoe: I know I've heard that name somewhere before... \"MC Bomber\"... Yeah... I heard it real recently, too... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Lunch Special Gumshoe: I haven't got anything to say about that, pal. ... Just take it away already, please? Phoenix: (Spending 20 dollars on this has got to be killing him inside...) Scooter Gumshoe: Hey! Are you putting this up for sale, pal? Phoenix: N-No! Why, would you want a busted up scooter like this anyway? Maya: Yeah. Plus, the seat's all covered in pigeon poop! Gumshoe: Who cares? If it runs, that's all that matters to me. Phoenix: (My phony was riding this bike... Maybe if I head back to the park. it'll be there again.) Victim's Lottery Ticket Gumshoe: A one-way ticket to happiness, huh? Phoenix: Glen Elg died because of this ticket. Gumshoe: Yeah, but it's still a one-way ticket to happiness, pal. Phoenix: And Maggey was found guilty of murder because of it, too. Gumshoe: ... Maya: ...Looks like anything about Maggey is an instant conversation stopper. Phoenix: Yeah. He's got a real soft spot for her, and it obviously hurts when you hit it! Apron Gumshoe: That's the apron Maggey was wearing. Yeah, it still smells like her, too. Maya: Does this mean Maggey smells like ketchup? Victim's Prescription Bag Gumshoe: We never did find the contents of that bag. Maya: It was medicine for Mr. Elg's ruptured eardrum, right? Gumshoe: Yeah. We found traces of it in his left ear canal. He must've used it while he was at Trés Bien. We're sure of that much. Millionaire Radio Flyer Gumshoe: Apparently everyone's listening to this show now. Maya: That's because everyone wants money. Gumshoe: They say that the victim, Glen Elg, was really into gambling. Maya: Yep. You can't beat gambling! I love it, too! I won 500 dollars last night playing cards with Nick. Phoenix: Huh? We were playing for money!? Maya: Of course! So you'd better pay up! Gumshoe: You're a smart one! ...Waiting for a cop to be present before asking for the cash! Godot profile Gumshoe: Mr. Godot agreed to take this case just so he could face you, pal. He was working on a bunch of more important cases, but he cancelled them all... Maya: Huh? But then... ...why didn't Mr. Godot take this case... ...when Maggey's first trial came up? Phoenix: Yeah. that is kinda odd. I mean, everyone thought the defense was \"Phoenix Wright\". So why didn't he try to fight \"me\" then? Gumshoe: Well, according to Mr. Godot... ...he knew the guy was a phony right away, so he didn't want to bother with the trial. Phoenix: (He couldn't be bothered to tell the judge!?) Maggey Byrde profile Gumshoe: Maggey's probably crying all alone right now, huh... Maya: Yeah, thanks to you. Gumshoe: Aaaaaaargh! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! Phoenix: Maya! Don't torch poor Gumshoe feelings like they're are some sort of cheap crème brûlée! Maya: You're really crazy about Maggey, aren't you? Gumshoe: No! No, no! I'm just... I'm not... It's not that I... Phoenix: (You don't have to hide it, Gumshoe! It's pretty obvious.) Maya: Yeah, you're way too plain-looking for Maggey. Right? Gumshoe: I'd arrest you right now if you weren't so right... Glen Elg profile Gumshoe: This guy was a real programming genius. They called him \"the walking computer\" at the place where he worked. Maya: What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!? Phoenix: (*groan* He wasn't LITERALLY a computer, Maya!) (Changed from [*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!] in the original release) Gumshoe: Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim. Phoenix: Yeah. That's what we found out yesterday, too. Maya: Hey, Detective Gumshoe. Don't you have any information that's a bit more fun? Gumshoe: F-Fun? I, uh... Oh! I know! So, have you paid a visit to where Elg worked yet? You might as well. Maya: His workplace? Where's that? Gumshoe: A computer firm called \"Blue Screens, Inc.\" or something like that. Maya: Sounds like a real stable company. This could be fun, Nick. Let's go! Phoenix: Computers aren't really my thing, Maya. Maya: We'll be fine! I know all about that hi-tech stuff. Phoenix: (I wonder about that...) Gumshoe: It's just around the corner from this joint. You should take a look. Phoenix: (A computer firm called \"Blue Screens, Inc.\" huh...) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I know I look a little rough around the edges. But the truth is, I'm a lot more \"detective-like\" than I used to be. Maya: Really? Like what part? Gumshoe: ...Like the color of my coat. Maya: Ah! You're right! Phoenix: (Yeah, but what about what's inside the coat...?) Victor Kudo profile Gumshoe: You know, in all my years, I've never seen a witness who was that confused before. Phoenix: Yeah, you looked pretty confused by his testimony. Gumshoe: Nothing against old guys, I like them and all... But... He sounded like he was pretty sure about what he saw. Maya: Yeah, that's the impression I got, too! Phoenix: (Me, three... But then, why doesn't even a single part of his testimony corroborate any of the facts?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh lá lá! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Maya: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". But I'll tell you want. This stuff works like a charm. I slept like a rock last night. Phoenix: O-Oh, really... That's nice... Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal... I can't discuss anything connected to the case. Maya: Hey! I thought you said you were going to help us out! Gumshoe: I can't help you out if I don't have any info! Phoenix: Yeah, I suppose the retrial has only just begun... January 7Vitamin Square Maya: Hmm... I don't see any sign of Mr. Kudo. Do you? Phoenix: Maybe he went to buy another ton of bird seeds. I was kind of hoping he wouldn't be here, anyway. At least, not for now. (Besides, any more seeds today and I'm liable to turn into a real phoenix!) Examine Scooter Maya: Hey, check this out... Phoenix: I wouldn't get too close to that if I were you. Otherwise you might be in for a shock. My phony must be lurking someplace nearby... Just imagine! A Tiger, loose in the city! Maya: Meanwhile the real Phoenix is like an abandoned chick, lost in a vast urban jungle! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Don't worry. Someday, you'll grow up and become a ferocious tiger, too! Don't lose hope! Phoenix: (Why is she trying to pep-talk me into becoming my phony...?) Orange Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: Speaking of fun, if we get Maggey acquitted, may be can all get together sometime. Maya: OK! ...But what do we play with someone who's never even won a game of Tic-Tac-Toe? Phoenix: How about we change the rules a bit, then? We could play Old Maid, and... um... We could say the person who's left with the old maid at the end is the winner. How's that? Maya: Not bad... Not bad at all! We could even rename the game to \"Fair Maiden\"! January 7Trés BienKitchen Maya: Huh? Mr. Armstrong's talking to someone. ???: I'll be back next month. Armstrong: Oui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you! ???: If you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here. Armstrong: Non! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise! ???: I love fire, you know... I love the way it crackles... Hee... Hee... Hee... Armstrong: Non, non, non! Stop it! I beg you! ???: Then don't let me down... I'll be watching you... Armstrong: Mais, non! Z'is is not necessary! You can trust me, mademoiselle! ???: Talk to anyone... and I'll drive a knife... right through your heart. Armstrong: Oh, non! You do not 'ave to worry. You know, you worry far too much. Maybe z'is will 'elp you relax. It is la oil of sandalwood. ???: I do love... raw meat... from time to time... Hee... Hee... Hee... Armstrong: Aaaaah! ???: I'll be taking my leave... Goodbye... for now! Armstrong: Urgh! I 'ave la shivers! I must rub some of my oil all over my body before I become z'e nervous wreck! Z'ere. Oh, oui, oui! Z'at feels good! Phoenix: Urgh! Armstrong: Oh là là! Excusez-moi, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My eyes! My EYES! Armstrong: Your eyes? If you 'ave trouble wi'z your eyes, you need z'is. La oil of sandalwood! Phoenix: Isn't this just the leftovers of what you were just using!? Examine Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I ate yesterday for lunch? Maya: Yeah, I think it's been permanently burned into my brain now... ...as an example of what truly awful food tastes like. Phoenix: (I bet it'd taste really good if it was prepared well. ...Balsamy even!) Talk Trés Bien Phoenix: You don't exactly have many customers, do you, Mr. Armstrong? Armstrong: Non, you are right, monsieur. But per'aps z'at is la perfect time for you to visit me, non? Now I can give you my undivided attention, and cook for you la dish suprême! Phoenix: Putting on a brave face, huh? Maya: That's what girls do, Nick! Armstrong: But you are right. Business is very difficult z'ese days. Per'aps ze name is la problem. People do not understand it. Z'ey think it is \"tray\". I just wanted people to think z'at my restaurant was exclusive. Phoenix: But they think you just serve fast food on cheap, plastic trays? Maya: Nick! That's the kind of thing that can make a girl cry! Phoenix: Have you forgotten that Mr. Armstrong is a man, Maya? Armstrong: But z'is restaurant is my life! It is everything to me! I will defend it to la finale! No one will take it from me! The woman just now Phoenix: So who was that woman you were just talking to? Armstrong: Oh lá lá! You saw z'at? Phoenix: Ah, well... Yes. Sorry. Maya: So? Who was she!? She looked so polite and graceful. Armstrong: P-Polite!? G-Graceful!? Maya: And she likes raw meat and fires, right? ???: I'll be back next month. Armstrong: Oui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you! ???: If you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here. Armstrong: Non! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise! Phoenix: (Now that I think about it...) Hey, Maya... I think it's pretty clear what kind of conversation they were having. Maya: You think so? Well, then let's show him that piece of evidence and see what happens! The woman just now (appears after presenting Jean's Loan Contract) Phoenix: The woman who was here earlier... I take it that she's... um... Armstrong: Why 'as it come to z'is...? What a tragedy! Suddenly I find myself so deep in la debt. It is a sign of la bad, bad world we live in, uh? Phoenix: (No. I'd say it's more of a sign of la bad, bad culinary skills...) Armstrong: Z'e woman who was 'ere... Z'e scary woman... She is from la loan office. Phoenix: Loan office? Is that where you borrowed half a million dollars from? Armstrong: Oui. Tender Lender, it is called. Maya: Catchy name. Just hearing it makes me wanna borrow some money. Armstrong: Please! You must not borrow from z'em. If you must, no more z'an ten dollars! Phoenix: Ten dollars? Sounds like your whole monthly stipend, Maya... Maya: Hey! I get a bit more than that, thank you very much! Phoenix: So Tender Lender is the loan office you borrowed half a million from, huh? Maya: I wonder if they've got anything to do with this case... Tender Lender (appears after \"The woman just now\") Armstrong: I am a weak woman. When I am upset, I 'ave to buy something nice to cheer me up. Thanks to 'im loaning me la money, I 'ave to pay back 'alf a million dollars now! I am like 'is slave. I 'ave to do everything z'at 'e tells me. Maya: Um... Who's this he? Armstrong: La Tiger... Maya: The Tiger? Armstrong: Oui. 'E is la manager of z'e Tender Lender. A terrifying man! La big city mobster! When 'e shouts at me, my knees are trembling and 'is voice is ringing in my ears for 3 days! As soon as I 'ear la noise of z'at battered old scooter 'e rides, I start to cry! Phoenix: (A big city mobster who rides a battered old scooter...?) Um, does this guy resemble me by any chance? Armstrong: Oh, non, non, non! Z'is man 'as a presence! A most formidable personality! Although... Oui, 'e does 'ave la spikey 'air just like you. Oui, z'ere is a resemblance z'ere, I suppose. Phoenix: (Hmm... Sounds like this loan office is worth checking out after all...) Armstrong: If you want to visit z'e Tender Lender, it is just beyond Vitamin Square. Maya: Hey, Nick... If you need money, I can loan you some... As long as it's less than 3 dollars... Phoenix: Um... Thanks for the offer... (...Just beyond Vitamin Square, huh?) Present Magatama Armstrong: Oh, what a beautiful pendant! It would look stunning on me w'iz la earrings! Maya: Please don't steal it again, OK? It's one of a kind! Armstrong: I could just 'ave a sliver of it, non? Maya: I-It's not a block of cheese, you know! Sports Paper Phoenix: This is the paper the victim brought with him. Armstrong: \"MC Bomber\"...? Oui... Maya: Does that mean something to you? Armstrong: Non, I only speak French, mademoiselle. Maya: But we found it behind your magazine rack... Armstrong: Oh, 'ow naughty I am! I 'aven't cleaned for such a long time! Lunch Special Armstrong: Oh là là! So you 'ave eaten my lunch, oui? Tell me, monsieur. Did you enjoy la lunch I prepared for you? Phoenix: It was a... unique and... wild mixture of flavors. Maya: That was the first time I ever had lobster, you know! Armstrong: Lobster? Z'ere was no lobster in my lunch... Maya: Huh? But, it said, \"lobster\" right on the menu. Armstrong: Mademoiselle Maya. Please, you must read la menu more carefully. It says, \"A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with a balsamic vinaigrette. Maya: Oh. It's \"inspired\", is it? Armstrong: Oui. \"Inspired\" by z'ese ingredients, but not per'aps made from z'em, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Well, guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, Nick. Phoenix: (The way the lunch tasted, it's probably 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.) Scooter Armstrong: ... Maya: What is it? Armstrong: Is z'is your scooter? Phoenix: No, no! I saw it before in Vitamin Square, you see... Armstrong: Mon dieu! Non, non, non! Take it away! Do not show z'at to me! Phoenix: (Talk about an allergic reaction...) Jean's Loan Contract Armstrong: So long as z'at paper exists, I am but a delightful angel w'iz la broken wings! Maya: An angel, huh...? Doesn't bode well, when you think about it... Armstrong: Oui! Z'ey kept 'arassing me month after month. In z'e end, I 'ad to give in. I agreed to 'elp z'em. Maya: Help them? With what? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr, if I did not owe z'em la money, I would 'ave refused. But my 'ands were tied! Phoenix: Please! What did you agree to help them with? Armstrong: Non. I-I cannot say! If I tell you, z'at woman, she will slice me up... ...and eat me w'iz la salad garnish! Phoenix: (Eww! I hope he doesn't mean that he'll literally be sliced up and served with garnish...) I'm going to guess that woman has something to do with your loan contract. Am I right? Armstrong: Ah! Maya: Please, Mr. Armstrong, tell us about that woman! Victor's Testimony Armstrong: Ah, it is true. My vases are broken all z'e time. I bought a new one z'e next day after la incident. But z'ey wouldn't let me put it on la table because of la investigation. Victim's Lottery Ticket Armstrong: If only I 'ad taken z'e right lottery ticket... I would not 'ave any debts right now. I would be free! Maya: Look on the right side, Mr. Armstrong. You won a dollar, right? Phoenix: (A lack of remorse for having stolen something: Priceless.) Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: You 'ave la perfect face for a waitress, you know. Maya: Um, thanks. I guess if things don't work out someday, then maybe I'll be back. Phoenix: (What things? Is she talking about her being a spirit medium...?) Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Oh, 'ow it 'urts me to see z'at poor girl's face! Phoenix: Maggey's? Armstrong: I 'eard she was super'umanly un'appy. Maya: Superhumanly...? Armstrong: And if she 'adn't come to work for me, she wouldn't 'ave got into z'is mess. Phoenix: (Huh? I'm missing something here, aren't I?) Armstrong: Je suis désolé, Maggey! Forgive me! After presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien: January 7Blue Screens, Inc. Maya: Wow! This place is so hi-tech! You can almost smell the electricity in the air! Phoenix: It is a computer firm, Maya. They can't work without electricity, you know. ???: Who are you? Maya: Oh, umm... Hello... ???: I'm sorry. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only. This is a computer programming laboratory. There are far too many trade secrets that could be leaked. Maya: Wow! What secrets!? ???: Everything you see here is classified. No information can leave this building. Maya: Understood! Phoenix: (Who is this woman? She's like a robot from some kind of whacked edumacational show...) Basil: My name is Lisa Basil. I'm the company director. Phoenix: D-Director!? (Sh-She's human!? She seems more like a ghost in a shell. And that thing over her eye... Isn't that the same device as Glen Elg's?) Maya: That's an [sic] DMH, right? Phoenix: Nice try, but it's the other way around, Maya. It's an HMD. Basil: All of my programmers here at Blue Screens, Inc. are supplied with HMDs. Maya: Then do you write programs, too? Basil: No. I just enjoy wearing this. Maya: They ARE pretty cool! I wouldn't mind one! Examine Pillars Phoenix: Those pillars almost look like they're moving. It's kind of unsettling. Maya: Nah, they just look a bit twisted or warped or whatever word I'm looking for... Basil: This office was designed with a futuristic feel in mind. Maya: Futuristic? Basil: Yes. We tried to imagine what things might look like in the future when we designed it. It helps to soothe and calm the soul. Maya: ... On second thought, I agree with you, Nick. This place is really unsettling. Super computer Maya: Hey, look Nick! It's a super-computer! It looks like it's really smart and wise, doesn't it? Phoenix: Computers are only as smart as the humans who use them, Maya. Maya: That explains why we don't use the computer in our office! Phoenix: You work there too, Maya. Maya: Yeah, but at least I'm... Basil: Please. Don't argue about something that's so trivial. Otherwise the computer will laugh at you. Maya: She said she'd laugh at us, Nick. Phoenix: (She's a human, Maya, not a computer!) Programmers Phoenix: He's really pounding that keyboard, isn't he? Maya: Wow! I bet that's where the \"pro\" in \"programmer\" comes from, huh? I guess I shouldn't be resting on my laurels. Gotta expand my skill set and all that. Phoenix: Yeah, that's a good idea. Maya: Maybe I could become Old Seedy's apprentice. Phoenix: (Um... And what about your spirit medium training?) Tickets on floor Maya: Wow! Look at this mess! Phoenix: Looks like they're all betting tickets. Maya: What kind of betting tickets? Phoenix: For betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets. Maya: Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these... Phoenix: (Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.) Glen Elg's Losing Horse Racing Tickets gathered up. Maya: This many tickets would get you... what? A buck down at the recycling center? But I didn't know you were so hard up that you'd try to profit from the dead, Nick. (Changed from [You're hopeless, Nick. You know that?] in the original release) Phoenix: (I'm just taking them as evidence, Maya!) Tickets on floor (subsequent times) Maya: Wow! Look at this mess! Phoenix: Looks like they're all betting tickets. Maya: What kind of betting tickets? Phoenix: For betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets. Maya: Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these... Phoenix: (Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.) Horse calendar Maya: Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess! Phoenix: Looks pretty average to me. Maya: But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this. Phoenix: You think? Real whiz-kids can work under any condition, you know. Maya: ...! Phoenix: (She's trying to hint that I should tidy my desk more. I'll clean up my desk when Maya stops asking silly questions... No hurry then.) Maya: Hey! This calendar... Phoenix: What about it...? If this is another hint about tidying, you can forget it. Maya: Someone's marked December 3rd in red pen! Phoenix: December 3rd? That's the day Mr. Elg was murdered! Is there anything else? Maya: Yeah. Umm... It says, \"Meet with The Tiger.\" Phoenix: The T-Tiger? Glen's Calendar added to the Court Record. Horse calendar (subsequent times) Maya: Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess! Phoenix: Looks pretty average to me. Maya: But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this. Phoenix: You think? Real whiz-kids can work under any condition, you know. Maya: ...! Phoenix: (She's trying to hint that I should tidy my desk more. I'll clean up my desk when Maya stops asking silly questions... No hurry then.) Talk Blue Screens, Inc. Phoenix: So... What exactly is this firm's business? Basil: I will try to simplify it so that you can understand... We analyze the data management systems required by certain branches of industry... ...and deliver optimum operating system and source-level components. Maya: Huh? You lost me on the corner of Analyze and Management. Phoenix: It doesn't matter. They analyze stuff. You got that much, right? Basil: The software we produce is distributed on CDs. Maya: CDs...? Basil: Yes. Compact disc. Digital optical storage media. Phoenix: (Of course, CDs are used for software as well as music...) Basil: It is a small firm, but all of my employees are first-class programmers. Let's ask one of them what they are doing. Excuse me. What are you working on right now? Programmer: I'm researching the impact of time-slicing common areas in multi-threaded code on logical access to shared global variables. Obviously, program structure heavily influences response time and performance, so the co-independence of global variables and memory overheads is vitally important to the success of the execution. Basil: Well, you get the idea. This is the sort of thing we are involved in. Did you good people follow all of that? Maya: Y-Y-Yeah... Phoenix: (Your blank smile just said otherwise, Maya.) What happened Phoenix: You know about what happened, right, Ms. Basil? Basil: You mean about Glen being poisoned? Yes, I know. It's terrible. Maya: Can you tell us anything that might be helpful? Basil: I don't think so. A police officer was here earlier, too. But I couldn't tell him anything either, because... ...the waitress who committed the crime has nothing to do with Blue Screens, Inc. Maya: Oh... Phoenix: How about Mr. Elg's desk? Have you cleared it out already? Basil: No, not yet. It's the one, right in front of you. If there's anything that might be useful to you, you are welcome to take it. Phoenix: (I guess there might be a clue here somewhere...) Glen's troubles (appears after presenting Glen Elg profile) Phoenix: Um, about Mr. Elg... Was he in some kind of trouble? Basil: I'm sorry? Why would you think that? Phoenix: I thought you said something about it just now? You said he got himself into trouble because he was a bit of a \"loser\". Basil: ... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Three Psyche-Locks?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock?] in the original release) Maya: I guess Mr. Elg is like every other man with his pile of secrets. Glen's troubles (subsequent times) Phoenix: Please tell us more about the trouble that Mr. Elg was in. Basil: I'm sorry. I don't know anything about that. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Basil: I do not pry into other people's affairs. Maya: She just gave us the dreaded \"professional, business-like cold-shoulder\", huh? Phoenix: (I need to find out exactly what the victim was involved in. Looks like I've got to break her in a \"professional, business-like\" manner!) Present Glen Elg profile Phoenix: Um, about Mr. Elg... Basil: He was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. But he did suffer from one or two bugs in his personality. Maya: Oh? Like what? Basil: He was a bit of a \"loser\"... Perhaps that would be the best way to describe it. That's what got him into trouble... ... Maya: What's the matter? Basil: He was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. So he was really no trouble at all. A model employee. Phoenix: Hey, wait a minute! Just now you said something about him being in trouble! (We've got to find out what this trouble was exactly.) Anything else Maya: Umm, would you mind taking a look at this? Basil: I'm sorry. That data is SuPer-Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected. Maya: SuPer Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected!? What!? This is madness! Phoenix: No, Maya. That is SPARDA. She won't tell us unless we say the right code word. Maya: A code word? Hmm... ... Sesame! Basil: ... Maya: If it's not \"sesame\", then it must be her mother's maiden name. That's how it always is. Phoenix: There's no point in having a password if it's always the same thing, Maya. (I guess she just doesn't want to talk about this.) Maya: Maybe we should focus on asking about Glen Elg. What do you say? Trés Bien Present Lisa Basil profile Gumshoe: That lady is the boss of Blue Screens, Inc., pal. Yeah... I figure she's clean. She got nothing to hide. She seemed kinda like a doll to me. In a good way and a bad way. ... Kinda makes you think she might be hiding something. Trés Bien (after breaking Psyche-Lock, then clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien, and clearing \"Tender Lender\" Talk option in Trés Bien - Kitchen) Gumshoe: Well, I'm gonna head back to the precinct now. We've got a big meeting starting in a bit. Maya: About Maggey's case, you mean? Gumshoe: No, that's pretty much wrapped up now... There's another big case going down at the moment, so she's been pushed aside... Maya: OK. Well, see you later then. Gumshoe: Bye! Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... Phoenix: ......... Y-You better get going, Detective, or you'll be late. Gumshoe: Actually, I, um... I've kinda got a favor to ask. It's a big one! Phoenix: A favor? Gumshoe: Yeah... It's for, um... Maggey, actually. I was kinda hoping... you'd give this to her for me. Maya: What is it? Gumshoe: It's a lunchbox. I got up early so I could make it. I've been real worried about her. She looked like she'd lost a lot of weight. Maya: Detective Gumshoe... ... How many weenies are in here!? There's not a person on earth who could down this much meat. Gumshoe: You think? I love weenies. I can't get enough of their tender juiciness. So will you give to her? It took me ages to make, so please say you will, pal! Phoenix: (I can't exactly say no, can I?) Gumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya to carry. Maya: Maybe I'll eat it myself if I get hungry! Gumshoe: Don't forget, OK? I'm counting on you to give that to Maggey. Phoenix: (He's finally gone...) January 7Tender Lender Maya: ...This place gives off a really strange vibe, doesn't it? Phoenix: Looks like \"The Tiger\" isn't in his lair. (And that is, as they say, a very good thing.) ???: ...Welcome... Phoenix: *gulp* (Talk about a creepy voice! It makes your soul want to shrivel up and die!) ???: You're here... to discuss a loan...? Phoenix: Uh, no. Not exactly... ???: The manager is away at the moment... Wait quietly... please... Maya: She's gone! Just like that! Phoenix: I guess we'll just have to come back another time. Maya: But this is the perfect opportunity, Nick! This place reeks of suspicion! Come on, Nick! Let's take a look around, OK? Phoenix: Do you think it'd be OK...? Maya: Of course! No one will ever know... ???: ...Coffee...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll leave it here for you to enjoy... Quietly. Phoenix: Y-Yes! Thank you! ???: Do not touch the desk... Please... Maya: N-N-Nick! Let's g-get out of here! Phoenix: (NOW she wants to get out of here...) Examine Desk on rug Phoenix: That's one impressive desk on one impressive rug! Maya: It's solid gold, Nick! Gold! Just look at that shine! Only real gold shines like that. Phoenix: Would you really want such a shiny desk, though? Maya: I don't know, but let's see what it's like to sit at a solid gold desk... Wow! I'm completely dazzled! Phoenix: That's because it's completely dazzling! Maya: I can see up my nose in the reflection! That's gotta be really distracting! Phoenix: (So the desk isn't practical. No surprise there.) Punching bag Maya: What's this? Phoenix: It's a punching bag. Maya: What!? No way. You wouldn't catch me walking around with a bag like that! Phoenix: What do you mean, \"walking around\"? Maya: The design's gross to start with, and it's way too heavy to be practical. And why's it called a \"punching\"-bag? Don't people know messenger bags are in! I knew it. I was right before, back at Trés Bien. Paris fashion is more my thing. Phoenix: (I really, really hope she's pulling my chain on this one.) CD player Phoenix: There's a CD player on the desk. But the desk is so loud, it's a wonder you can hear it. Maya: The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into. ???: Have you finished... ...the coffee? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Y-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely. ???: ... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... *gulp* ???: ...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup... Phoenix: (Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!) Maya: Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast... Phoenix: I-I sure hope so... (We better take a look at that CD while we're still alive and have the chance...) What the...!? Maya: What!? It's not the Rocko soundtrack, is it? Claw of the Tiger? Phoenix: It's... It's a demo CD... The artist's name has been hand-written on the disc in pen. \"MC Bomber\"... Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (This must be the CD Maggey told us about!) Maya: Let's listen to it! I bet it's heavy metal! Phoenix: No way! That woman'll make us drink more coffee if we do! MC Bomber added to the Court Record. CD player (subsequent times) Phoenix: There's a CD player on the desk. But the desk is so loud, it's a wonder you can hear it. Maya: The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into. ???: Have you finished... ...the coffee? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Y-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely. ???: ... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... *gulp* ???: ...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup... Phoenix: (Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!) Maya: Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast... Phoenix: I-I sure hope so... Items on bookshelf Maya: Let's see... This round doll thing is called a \"daruma\"... I think. I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering. Phoenix: You mean you aren't making stuff up for a change? Maya: Heh. I bet you also didn't know that no matter what, he'll always right himself. Go on, Nick! Give him a good shove! Phoenix: Only if I feel like dying! Maya: Now, this yellow thing... This is a Japanese chess piece. I think it's a \"king\"? Not that I'm an expert or anything... I'm more of a Reversi person, you know. Phoenix: (Assuming she knows what she's talking about, these aren't exactly your typical... ...\"mobster wannabe\" items. They're not... \"trophies\", are they...? *gulp*) Maya: Hey... There's a piece of paper sticking out from under here. Phoenix: What is it? ...A repair bill? (Looks like he did some repair work on his car... Does he even have one...?) $15,000 to replace a bumper and a light!? That's insane! Maya: The car's registered to... the \"Cadaverinis\"? Phoenix: Huh? So it's not even The Tiger's car? (Why would someone else's repair bill be in The Tiger's office...?) Repair Bill added to the Court Record. Items on bookshelf (subsequent times) Maya: Let's see... This round doll thing is called a \"daruma\"... I think. I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering. Phoenix: You mean you aren't making stuff up for a change? Maya: Heh. I bet you also didn't know that no matter what, he'll always right himself. Go on, Nick! Give him a good shove! Phoenix: Only if I feel like dying! Maya: Now, this yellow thing... This is a Japanese chess piece. I think it's a \"king\"? Not that I'm an expert or anything... I'm more of a Reversi person, you know. Phoenix: (Assuming she knows what she's talking about, these aren't exactly your typical... ...\"mobster wannabe\" items. They're not... \"trophies\", are they...? *gulp*) Frame Phoenix: \"Win Through Compromise\"...? Maya: I wonder what that's supposed to mean... Phoenix: It must mean something if they took the trouble to frame it like that. Maya: Yeah well, it still doesn't make any sense to me... ???: ...That... Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: That's Tender Lender's guiding principle. Maya: Oh? ???: \"Compromise the customer to win.\" Maya: O-Oh, I see... How about you, Nick...? Phoenix: Yeah, umm... Well, as long as we don't have to compromise my hair, I'd say we're OK... (That's one slogan no business owner should ever explain to their customers... *shudder*) Spilled ashtray Maya: Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up. Phoenix: Yeah. It's all over the rug and everything. Maya: I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal. Phoenix: (How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?) Maya: Oh, hey! There's a book of matches here, too! Phoenix: Matches, huh? Places don't give those out much nowadays. ...Hey, wait a second! Maya: What is it? Phoenix: Look what's printed on its cover! It says, \"Trés Bien\"! (Changed from [Look what's printed on the back! It says, 'Trés Bien'!] in the original release) Trés Bien Matches added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (These matches could come in handy. We might be able to use them...) Maya: Yeah. The pilot light for the office boiler keeps going out. Phoenix: Swing and a miss, Maya. Swing and a miss. Spilled ashtray (subsequent times) Maya: Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up. Phoenix: Yeah. It's all over the rug and everything. Maya: I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal. Phoenix: (How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?) Hanging clothes Maya: Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic! Phoenix: (Looks more like a pimp coat to me... Guess I haven't got an eye for fashion.) Maya: Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick. Phoenix: Hmm... The same color as my suit...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Keep your voice down, Maya! Maya: N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this! ???: Some cake...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll just leave it here for you... Maya: Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks... ???: Just wait here quietly... Otherwise... Maya: S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said! Phoenix: Y-Yeah! Sure! ???: I have my eye on you... Only so I can \"take care of you\".... Understand...? Maya: Aah! I'm scared, Nick! Phoenix: ...So? What were you getting so excited about before? Maya: Look, on the lapel of this suit... Phoenix: That's...! That's an attorney's badge! Maya: Is The Tiger a lawyer!? Phoenix: No way! Look at this thing! It's made of paper! (Changed from [No way! Look at this badge! It's made of paper!] in the original release) Paper Badge added to the Court Record. Maya: For some reason, your badge suddenly looks really cheap to me, Nick. Phoenix: (Why doesn't anyone recognize an obviously fake badge when they see one...?) Hanging clothes (subsequent times) Maya: Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic! Phoenix: (Looks more like a pimp coat to me... Guess I haven't got an eye for fashion.) Maya: Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick. Phoenix: Hmm... The same color as my suit...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Keep your voice down, Maya! Maya: N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this! ???: Some cake...? Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: I'll just leave it here for you... Maya: Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks... ???: Just wait here quietly... Otherwise... Maya: S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said! Phoenix: Y-Yeah! Sure! ???: I have my eye on you... Only so I can \"take care of you\".... Understand...? Maya: Aah! I'm scared, Nick! After examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes: ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (Come out from under the desk, Maya!) The Tiger: Whad are youse two snoopin' around in my office for!? Phoenix: N-Nothing. W-We were just... The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! My precious carpet! Youse got ash on my rug! You' gonna wish your ugly feet never came through my door! Phoenix: I-It wasn't us! It was already like th-- The Tiger: Youse wanna argue with me!? Is that what you' doin'? You dink youse can take me on!? I'm gonna flatten youse two into pancakes and turn youse into my new rugs! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: ...Oh... Don Tigre... You're back... Phoenix: (Ack... That voice... It's like evil seeping into your head through your ears...) ???: ...I'm sorry... Don Tigre... I knocked over that ashtray before... and... Phoenix: (Eek! Has she got a death wish or what!?) The Tiger: ... Oh, right. Phoenix: Huh? The Tiger: F-Forget about it, Violetta. I-It's noddin'... Phoenix: (What, what, what!?) The Tiger: I ain't gonna get mad at you. You' too cute, you hear! Phoenix: (That's so unfair!) ???: Here... Have some cookies... I just baked them... And you'll need some strong espresso... while you're discussing your loan... The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: Y-Yes!? The Tiger: Youse either crazy or just plain stupid to chase after me! I worked so hard, but now youse gotta come and mess up my plan... Phoenix: (So it was him... He's my phony...) The Tiger: Heh, but I don't care. No one gets in my way! Phoenix: Wh-What? I mean, e-excuse me? The Tiger: Heh heh heh! Youse shoulda left de little girl at home, Wright. Phoenix: Um... I have a few things I want to ask-- The Tiger: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Maya: Aaaaaaaah! The Tiger: No questions! Dis is de last time we meet! Phoenix: Ack! Wait! P-Please! Maya: ...That was pretty weak, Nick. You waited until he was out of earshot before you shouted after him. Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk! I didn't hear you scream, \"Hold it!\" either!) ???: ...The espresso... Maya: Aaaaaaaah! ???: ...And cookies... Phoenix: (This woman is definitely not good for my heart. Now, what was it The Tiger called her...? \"Violetta\"?) Talk Tender Lender Phoenix: So... I'm kind of curious about your company, Tender Lender... Violetta: ...With the warm and friendly atmosphere you'd expect from a family-sized business... ...a conscientious rate of interest... and an attractive repayment policy... Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling this sentence is not going to end well...?) Violetta: ...we will tenderly lend you that little bit extra, here at Tender Lender. Maya: Hey, Nick. Things are a bit tight for Wright and Co. at the moment, aren't they? I mean there's that 500 dollars you owe me from our card game for starters. Why don't you take out a loan? Phoenix: (Would I like to take out a loan from a place like this? Not so much...) Violetta: Tender Lender is... on your side... Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: So, um, let's say I'm late with my repayment... What happens then? Violetta: ...We'd give you more coffee... ...Strong coffee... Phoenix: Um, right... I think I'd rather skip down! Maya: Hey! Just remember I can make strong coffee too, Nick! Strong tea, as well! What happened Phoenix: So, um, do you know about the incident we're investigating? Violetta: What incident...? Maya: Well, a man was poisoned in a restaurant just near here. That incident. Violetta: Let me see... I was here that day, with the manager... Phoenix: The manager being The Tiger...? Violetta: ...Furio Tigre... Maya: F-Furio... Phoenix: ...T-Tigre? (So that's where the \"Tiger\" thing comes from...) Maya: Xin Eohp's got a real name! Nick! Hurry up and find out more about him! Saved your life? (appears after presenting Furio Tigre profile) Violetta: I'm very... frail, you see... Just recently, I... died... Once... Hee... Hee... Maya: You d-died!? Violetta: About 4 months ago... The doctors said to... abandon all hope... Phoenix: (I guess they were expecting her to take a boat ride across the River Styx.) Violetta: But Don Tigre... He saved me. He gave up everything... Maya: Everything!? Violetta: When I found out what he had done for me, I... was happy... Maya: No offense, but I'm finding that a little hard to believe. Violetta: I decided I'd pay him back... with my life... by serving him coffee... and espresso... Phoenix: (I still wonder about what's in her coffee...) So... is that why you've got that bandage around your head? Violetta: Hee... Hee... Hee... This? The head bandage (appears after \"Saved your life?\") Phoenix: Um, so what's the story with the bandage? Violetta: ... They put it on after the operation... Maya: Operation? Violetta: It's just a little injury... A little, fatal, injury... Hee... Hee... Hee... Maya: A f-f-fatal injury!? Phoenix: (Maya just suffered one herself, by the sound of it...) So, that's the injury you were talking about before when you said you had died once? Violetta: ... 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: ...! Maya: Urgh! She really creeps me out, Nick! Phoenix: (Same here. But we've got to find out the truth!) The head bandage (subsequent times) Violetta: It was very complicated... The operation... They opened up my head... And performed surgery on my frontal lobe... Maya: Urgh! Just thinking about it sends shivers down my spine! Phoenix: So how did you get this \"fatal injury\" that left you needing an operation? 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS Violetta: I made a promise to Don Tigre... I said I would never tell... Cross my heart and hope to drink 100 cups of espresso... Phoenix: Oh. (That much caffeine would raise anyone from the dead!) Violetta: Besides... It's a very precious memory to me... Phoenix: A... A precious memory...? (I'll never find out what she means if I can't break her...) Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Can I ask you about The Tiger, I mean, Mr. Tigre? Violetta: ...Cookie...? Maya: S-Sure...? Violetta: How do you like my cookies? I baked them myself... Hee... Hee... Hee... Maya: Go ahead, Nick! The honor is all yours! Phoenix: No, no! Ladies first, Maya! Violetta: Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: (No matter how I look at this, I just don't get it... What are The Tiger and this scary girl doing working together?) Violetta: We... are lovers... Phoenix: (That's not exactly coming across in your tone of voice...) Violetta: And I owe Don Tigre my life... He's the one who saved me... Phoenix: The Tiger... saved you...!? Violetta: Please, address him properly as \"Don Tigre\". Otherwise, I'll have to... Phoenix: OK, OK! Don Tigre! Of course! I'm sorry. (He saved her life? I'd sure like to how that happened.) Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Violetta: More coffee...? You must have more... Phoenix: No! Um, thanks! I've had enough. Really! (I'm so thirsty!) Violetta: I don't leave the office... I can't tell you about anything... except Don Tigre. January 7Vitamin Square Maya: There he is! Old Seedy's back feeding the pigeons again! Kudo: There! Take this! And this! And get out of my park! Phoenix: Like I thought, he's really mad... Come on, Maya. Just keep your head down and let's sneak away while we still can... Maya: What? Why? Hellooo, old man! Phoenix: What are you doing, Maya!? Kudo: Huh!? ...Kah! Maya: Hey, he just turned his back on us! Phoenix: I'm not surprised. I bet I really hurt his pride in court this morning. Maya: Hey, Mr. Kudo! Kudo: Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Hmm, pi-pi-pigeon, hmm... Kah! Maya: Look, we really need to talk to you, alright? Kudo: Out with the demons! In with good fortune! Maya: Ow! Ow! Ow! Seeds... Shell splinters... Painful... Phoenix: I always knew you were a demon, Maya! Talk Today's trial Phoenix: Um... I'm sorry about what happened in court earlier today. Kudo: Kah! Everyone'll be talking about me behind my back now! A dirty old man who was so busy looking at the serving girl's backside... ...that he can't remember her face! A filthy, depraved animal! Phoenix: N-Not at all! Kudo: Are you listening to me, boy!? I don't care what you say, I saw that waitress put it in! She put some white powder into the young lad's javaccino! Maya: We hear you... Kudo: And another thing! The young layabout was wearing an earpiece! On the same side as the lens of his broken spectacles! Maya: W-We're really sorry... Kudo: So I made a little mistake about the vase. So what!? I know what I saw! I tell you, I tell you, I tell you! Phoenix: OK, OK! Take it easy, please, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Don't tell me to take it easy, you spikey-haired brat! Take this! Embroiderer Maya: Um... You said you were a craftsman, right? Kudo: Kah! The modern world casts honest craftsmen like me aside in droves! Maya: S-Surely it's not that... Kudo: I come from a long line of craftsmen. Right back to the time of the shoguns! Do you hear me!? I didn't become an embroiderer, I was BORN one! Maya: Actually... I'm kind of in the same situation myself. Kudo: I... I... I wanted to stick my fingers up that dribbling old judge's nose... ...and scream right down his earhole... \"Objection!\" Maya: Oh... So, did you want to become a lawyer when you were young...? Phoenix: I don't think that's quite it, Maya. I think he's just in a bad mood, that's all... Kudo: I've got a tsunami of frustration inside and it's ready to burst out! Phoenix: (If we let him start rambling now, we might never shut him up! What should I do?) Cut in Phoenix: Um, actually, we've got places to go, things to check and stuff... Maybe another time? Kudo: Fine! Whatever! Just don't forget! I've got a tsunami's worth of grumbling to do. Phoenix: Yes, yes. This girl right here is really looking forward to hearing it all. Honest! Maya: What!? I never said that! Kudo: Come to the place where I work, then. Here. Bring this along with you. Phoenix: (What is this? It's covered in seeds... A discount coupon for a burger!?) Maya: He really wants someone to grumble at, huh? ...Although, it IS a burger joint... Leads back to Talk options Suck it up Phoenix: (Guess I better let him talk...) So, there's not much call for craftsmen these days, then? Kudo: Of course not, you idiot! All I'm good for nowadays is running errands! Maya: Errands? Kudo: Everyone takes advantage of the elderly! \"Buy some bread, gramps!\" \"Take the dog for a walk, granddad!\" \"Feed the pigeons, old man!\" What am I? Some sort of two-bit community handyman!? Maya: Um, well... Kudo: \"Buy some bread\", now that I can understand. But what's the point of feeding some seedy pigeons!? Why don't people say what they mean!? \"Get lost!\" That's what they're trying to say! Oh, yes! I'm just an inconvenience, you see! At home... At that restaurant... I just get in the way, don't I!? Phoenix: I-I'm sure you don't. (Wait a minute! What did he just say? At home and... at that restaurant?) Hold up... By \"restaurant\", are you talking about Trés Bien? Did you get asked to run an errand there, too? Kudo: Yes, I did! The very day that young brat was poisoned. Phoenix: WH-WHAT!? Leads back to Talk options The \"errand\" (appears after selecting \"Suck it up\" upon selecting \"Embroiderer\" Talk option) Phoenix: So on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do? Kudo: Glad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me. Armstrong: \"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!\" Kudo: \"Call them yourself!\" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time. Maya: So, did you end up calling the police? Kudo: Like I said, I was in a bit of a daze. Phoenix: Did you call them on your cell phone? Kudo: Kah! Do I look like I'd have one of those new-fangled thingamajigs? I went out looking for a pay phone, of course! Maya: You went looking for one...? Kudo: I couldn't find one right away, you know. Wandered around for 5 minutes or so. Maya: F-Five minutes...? Phoenix: So for five minutes after the incident happened... Kudo: Yessiree, the owner was at Trés Bien on his own. Phoenix: Why didn't you mention this in court this morning? Kudo: Well, I would have if you'd given me the chance! But you all bullied me out of the courtroom! Judge: *sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today. Kudo: WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else... Judge: Bailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom! Kudo: It's not my fault! You're the ones to blame! Phoenix: You could have at least told us before we got to court. Maya: Is it really that important that Mr. Kudo was the one who called the police...? Phoenix: (What's important is the unaccounted time before the police arrived. The victim was dead, and Maggey was unconscious. Which leaves that woman... I mean, that man, alone in the restaurant!) Mr. Kudo might have been chased out of the place on purpose. Maya: What do you mean? Phoenix: Maybe a certain someone didn't want him in the restaurant. Maya: Ah! Kudo: Oh, sure! You go ahead and say I was in the way as usual! I suppose I should've been getting myself covered in pigeon poop instead, hmm? Phoenix: (We need to get more details about what exactly happened... ...from Maggey... and from Mr. Armstrong!) The \"errand\" (subsequent times) Phoenix: So on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do? Kudo: Glad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me. Armstrong: \"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!\" Kudo: \"Call them yourself!\" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time. Maya: So, did you end up calling the police? Kudo: Like I said, I was in a bit of a daze. Phoenix: Did you call them on your cell phone? Kudo: Kah! Do I look like I'd have one of those new-fangled thingamajigs? I went out looking for a pay phone, of course! Maya: You went looking for one...? Kudo: I couldn't find one right away, you know. Wandered around for 5 minutes or so. Maya: F-Five minutes...? Phoenix: So for five minutes after the incident happened... Kudo: Yessiree, the owner was at Trés Bien on his own. Present Anything Phoenix: Um, would you mind taking a look at this? Kudo: ... Kah! Phoenix: Excuse me... Kudo: You let me get a million of my grumbles off my chest, and I'll take one quick look. I've got an earthquake of frustration inside and it's ready to rumble! Phoenix: ...On second thought, forget it. A million grumbles for one quick look doesn't sound like a good deal... for me. After clearing \"The \"errand\"\" Talk option in Vitamin Square: January 7Trés BienKitchen Maya: Looks like Mr. Armstrong's out again. Phoenix: But the place is open for business... You can't have an open restaurant without a chef! Maya: Hey! It's not my fault, Nick! Don't take it out on me! Phoenix: (Only a couple of minutes after the incident happened... Mr. Kudo left the scene, leaving Mr. Armstrong here alone.) Maya: Argh... Missing when we need to talk to him the most. Phoenix: (Maybe he's trying to avoid us on purpose?) After breaking Psyche-Lock, clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien: January 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room Byrde: Oh, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Hello, Maggey. So they finished questioning you? Byrde: Wasn't it just unbelievable in court today, sir!? I'm going to stay up all night and blog about everything that happened! Maya: Weren't you scared? It was pretty touch and go in there. Byrde: Yeah, but you totally nailed that old man! Phoenix: Well, he was all over the place with his testimony. Byrde: He's not the only one! Maya: Huh? What do you mean? Byrde: Everyone else's testimonies don't match up either. Not with what I remember of the incident, anyway... Phoenix: (Is it possible she is the one misremembering things...?) Talk Contradictions Maya: Maggey... You know how you said that everyone else... ...provided testimony that didn't match up with what you remembered? Byrde: Yup. There are just so many things that don't seem to add up. The biggest contradiction is the other guy I saw at the victim's table. HE was the one who slipped something into the victim's coffee. I'm sure it was him! Phoenix: (But didn't Mr. Kudo testify earlier today... ...that it was the waitress who put some white powder into the coffee cup...?) Maya: So you really think it was this \"disappearing man\" that did it...? Byrde: Well, he's not the only thing that disappeared. The CD vanished as well. You know, the CD with the writing on it. Maya: Oh, yeah. The \"MC Screwdriver\" album, right? Phoenix: It was \"MC Bomber\", Maya. That name was scrawled on the sports paper as well. Byrde: They never did find that CD at the crime scene, sir. Phoenix: (Or the victim's medication. That's gone missing, too.) Maya: Ouch, my head... This is getting way too complicated for me! After the incident Phoenix: You said that you passed out when the victim, Glen Elg, collapsed, right? Byrde: Yes. It's so embarrassing. I mean, I used to be a cop! When I came to, the restaurant was buzzing with police. And before I knew what was going on, they arrested me, sir. Phoenix: So between the time the victim collapsed and the time the police arrived on the scene... ...you have no idea what went on at Trés Bien. Byrde: No. No idea at all. Why? Is it important, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The other witness, the old man from the park, was pretty much chased out of the picture. Byrde: \"Chased out of the picture\"? What do you mean? Maya: Old Seedy wasn't inside the restaurant because he was told to go call the police. Phoenix: Exactly. And you, Maggey, were unconscious. That means Mr. Armstrong was alone in the restaurant for a brief period of time. Byrde: No... Y-You don't think Mr. Armstrong... set me up... do you? Phoenix: When you consider the facts... ...it's hard to imagine that Mr. Armstrong isn't involved in this at all. Byrde: Grr! It's like the master biting the paw of the dog that it feeds! Are you sure about this, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Well, the old man said as much when we spoke with him earlier. Byrde: I don't know. The things that man says don't add up for some reason, sir... Phoenix: (Maggey looks like she's trying to figure something out...) Maya: We'd better find outexactly what happened to the old man on that day. Victor's testimony (appears after presenting Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile) Phoenix: Is there anything about Mr. Kudo's testimony that stood out as odd to you? Byrde: Actually... Yes. The fact that he was even testifying to begin with doesn't quite... Maya: ...? \"Doesn't quite\" what? Byrde: Well, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant. Phoenix: (Yeah, we know that already. It was Victor Kudo.) Byrde: But I can't really say it was an old man. Maya: OK, then how about calling him a really old middle-aged man! Byrde: No, age isn't the issue. The other customer was a woman. Phoenix: A woman!? Maya: Are you sure, Maggey!? Byrde: Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I think so. Maya: So? What did this woman look like? Byrde: Umm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh. Phoenix: \"Creepy\"? Maya: \"Cackling\"? Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling I've come across a woman like that recently?) Present Sports Paper Byrde: That's the paper the victim had with him, isn't it? Maya: That's what we think, madam. Byrde: I kind of remember him having a paper, actually. And I remember something about this \"MC Bomber\", too. Maya: It was written on the CD that disappeared as well, wasn't it? Byrde: I don't suppose it makes any difference if there was one CD or two, right? Magazine Clipping Byrde: Just thinking about the trial that day gives me the creeps. Maya: Was it that bad? Phoenix: D-Don't forget that was my phony, not me! Byrde: He was supposed to say, \"Surely the defendant isn't the real criminal!\" But instead he shouted out, \"Surely the defendant is the real criminal!\" ...By mistake. Maya: Oh, ouch. Phoenix: L-Like I said, that was my phony, not me! Byrde: I...! I don't want to think about it anymore... Phoenix: (Trust me, neither do I...) Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile Byrde: Ah, I feel much better after the trial this morning. I've been a bit of a courtroom proceedings addict for years now. It feels like forever since I was a witness as slippery as that old man. Maya: He's not really that bad of an old man though. Byrde: Still, I feel a bit uneasy. Maya: Huh? I thought you just said you felt much better... Phoenix: Maggey. If there's something on your mind, you've got to tell us. Especially if it has anything to do with Mr. Kudo or his testimony. Byrde: Roger! I'll spill it all and see what you make of it! Coffee Cup Byrde: That's the cup I took over to the table, sir. But! I didn't put anything in it... I just... I could never do something like that! Maya: That's right! You could never do anything like that! Byrde: I'm not good at carrying those large trays, you know. Trying to balance a tray with one hand to put something in the coffee with the other... That'd just be asking for trouble. I'd drop something, for sure! Maya: Th-That's right! Phoenix: (...I-Is she expecting me to claim that she's too clumsy to have committed the crime...?) Apron Byrde: Oh, yeah. That's from when I was carrying a customer's breakfast over to them. Phoenix: The ketchup splotch, you mean? Byrde: My whole face was fire-engine red, thanks to that stuff. Maya: But you spilled the ketchup in your apron, didn't you? I don't see how... Byrde: The ketchup-covered omelet went flying and hit the customer in the face. Maya: Oh, talk about a tomato-red face! Makes me wish I could've seen it myself. Byrde: Yeah, I guess... It was kind of a sight to behold. Potassium Cyanide Byrde: Potassium cyanide? I've never heard of that poison before in my life, sir! Phoenix: ... Byrde: OK, maybe I have. But I've never seen it before. That's the truth. I wouldn't even know where the nearest potassium cyanide dealer is in the first place. Maya: Potassium cyanide dealers? Sounds like another group of drug pushers to avoid... Phoenix: In any case, this definitely isn't something you can pick up just anywhere. Byrde: Ooh!! Curse my rotten luck! The criminal must've stuck the bottle in my apron while I was unconscious! Gumshoe's Lunchbox Phoenix: Oh, yeah! I've got something you're going to love! Byrde: Really? What is it!? Phoenix: A lunchbox, just for you. Here! Byrde: Wow! A lunchbox! Weenies, too! I can't believe it! Thank you, sir! Did you make this just for me, Mr. Wright? Maya: Nah, it was Detective Gumshoe! Who else would make such a nice lunchbox for you? Byrde: Detective Gumshoe? Maya: He's really worried about you. Looks like he put a lot of effort into making this, too! Byrde: ... I can't accept it. Detention Center rules. No gifts allowed, sir. Phoenix: Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't be like that. Byrde: The rules are the rules! They'll lock you up if you break them. Phoenix: (Somehow, when an ex-cop turned waitress says that, it seems a whole lot scarier.) Byrde: And anyway... I hate weenies! Maya: O-Oh... really? Byrde: It's all yours, Maya! You can enjoy it with Mr. Wright! Maya: B-But... Phoenix: ... She's right... It's better than letting it go to waste. Maya: But! ...I guess so. Gumshoe's Lunchbox eaten with Maya. Byrde: ... Well? How was it? Phoenix: That hit the spot! I love weenies. Byrde: Oh, good! I'm glad I gave it to you, then, sir! Paper Badge Byrde: Ah! Is that... your attorney's badge? Phoenix: Actually, it's a fake. Byrde: Hoooly smokes! That's it!! Maya: Huh? Byrde: That's the badge your phony had, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: You got duped by this...!? Maya: But it's a completely different color! Phoenix: And what about the fact that it's made of paper!? Byrde: He said the badge got a tan as well, while he was in Hawaii on business. Phoenix: (I'm beginning to see how my phony was able to gain her trust...) Glen Elg profile Byrde: Ah! That's the victim, isn't it? Phoenix: That day was the first time you'd ever seen this man, right? Byrde: Yes. I'd never met or seen him before then. I just happened to be the waitress who served him his coffee, sir. That's all! Phoenix: It seems he was a computer programmer. Byrde: Really? I'm useless with computers. Completely hopeless. I don't know any computer programs. Phoenix: (Did she mean \"programmers\"?) Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Back when I was an officer, Detective Gumshoe always looked out for me. But today! Today I was the one who had to look out for him; trying to incriminate me the whole time! Phoenix: You've got to remember, Maggey. Gumshoe's a detective. He's got a job to do. Byrde: My old boss... I thought at least he'd be on my side. Maya: He is on your side! He'd do anything to help y-- Byrde: You can't fool me! I saw him in court today! I felt like a poor little baby woodpecker being pecked on the head by its own mother! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's testimony was pretty solid... No wonder it hurt her so much.) Byrde: I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again! Phoenix: (Ouch. I think I just saw Gumshoe's chances go down in flames like the Hindenburg...) Maya: I don't think it's getting through to her that he really was trying to help... Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Mr. Armstrong was very good to me after I was fired from the force. I can't believe someone as nice as him could have anything to do with this... Phoenix: (Well, in the time between the victim being poisoned and the police being called... ...the only person who was on the scene and had a chance to do anything... ...was Mr. Armstrong. There was no one else there.) Byrde: M-Mr. Armstrong wouldn't... He wouldn't set me up... would he!? Furio Tigre profile Byrde: Hoooly smokes! That's him!! Maya: Huh? Byrde: That's your phony, Mr. Wright! Just look at that ridiculous suntan! Phoenix: Um... For the record, I'm not sunburned like an over-dried tomato so I don't know... Byrde: He told me he'd been on a business trip to Hawaii and that's where he got the tan. Phoenix: (I'm not hearing this...) Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be in the police force. But I'm incarcerated, now. I don't pick up much information in here. All I can help you out with now is the menu at Trés Bien. Maya: Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't let your spirits fall! After examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes in Tender Lender, and clearing \"Victor's testimony\" Talk option and presenting Gumshoe's Lunchbox in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Detective: The main server just went up in smoke! Why the heck isn't the press conference set up yet!? The Superintendent's here already! Chief: Yeah. And there's a problem with the Internet, too. Detective: I already told you to stop using your computer, Chief! Chief: But I'm watching videos online! I'm catching up on my Asian soap operas! Detective: It's gonna have to wait, Chief. I'm throwing the switch! Chief: Nooo! Just when Sum Yung-Gai was about to confess to his son's hot-to-trot girlfriend! Maya: Wow! This place is really buzzing. Phoenix: Something must be going down. Something really big. Gumshoe: Huh!? What are you doing here, pal? Maya: Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: You can't be here right now. You'll be roped into the briefing if you stay. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: We've got big problems here today. Maya: Why? What's going on? Gumshoe: It's a virus! A virus!! Phoenix: (A virus?) Gumshoe: There's a virus ripping through the precinct's computer system. Phoenix: (But I really need to ask you some questions...) Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Your batteries won't last forever. Remember that when you're having fun... in bed.\" We have a winner! A little joke to make people think about their smoke alarms. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a fire safety campaign... ...I guess? ...Does he even know what he's trying to get across anymore? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut. Chief: Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to read the paper now. Phoenix: (Alternately, you could read some reports... Just a suggestion.) Chief: What the heck is this!? This paper's more than a month old! And someone's written all over it! Who's the clown that put this on my desk? Well? Speak up! Maya: He just wadded it up and chucked it in the trash! Phoenix: But that's an important piece of evidence! Talk Tender Lender Gumshoe: OK, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up! Maya: Y-Yes! Gumshoe: No matter how poor you get, never borrow money from a place like this, you hear? Maya: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: If you got money trouble, just go on a diet of instant noodles and hang in there! Phoenix: Ah, we're not thinking about borrowing money, Detective! We want information. Gumshoe: Oh... Is that all? Well, let's see... Tender Lender is considered to be even fishier than the average illegal loan shark. And it seems it ran into trouble just recently. Those guys have been pretty heavy-handed, calling in all their debts. Maya: Really? Gumshoe: Don't go poking your nose around in their business, pal. You'll really regret it if you upset that lady. Phoenix: Alright, I get the picture. (Hey, wait a minute! What did he just say!? \"That lady\"?) Maya: Who's this lady he's talking about, Nick? Phoenix: (We better find out what the story is with this \"lady\"...) Computer viruses Maya: So what exactly is a computer virus, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: I dunno. Maya: What? Gumshoe: Look, I just go with the flow, alright, pal? Phoenix: (And here I thought detectives were supposed to be somewhat knowledgeable...) Gumshoe: What's with that face, pal? You think you know what a virus is? Maya: Well, Nick? Do you? Phoenix: A computer virus? Sure. I mean, only in simple terms, of course. Maya: Really? Wow, you know everything. Professor Nick! Gumshoe: Yeah. I'm gonna call you Dr. Wright from now on! Maya: Hey, that sounds pretty cool! Don't you agree, Dr. Wright? Phoenix: (Why do I get the feeling they're making fun of me?) OK, fine. I'm no expert, but I can at least explain the basics to the two of you. What's a virus? (appears after \"Computer viruses\") Phoenix: A virus is a program that gets inside a computer and causes damage. Gumshoe: Damage? You mean it makes the machine go \"boom\" and explode? Phoenix: No. The damage is, um... Well, it's all internal. Maya: So the inside goes \"boom\", right? Phoenix: Imagine all the case data you've got stored on your PCs here in the station... A virus could wipe out all that. That's the kind of damage I'm talking about. Maya: Whoa! That's scary. Phoenix: Yeah. And what's even more scary is that viruses are infectious. Maya: Infectious? Phoenix: Most computers are connected together on a network, right? A virus can move on machine to another over the network. So the virus just keeps spreading faster and faster. Gumshoe: Hmph. Just like a real virus, huh. Maya: But, Nick! Why would anyone want to make a program like that? Gumshoe: Yeah. It takes ages to type in all that data. Why would you wanna destroy it, pal? Phoenix: No. People don't infect their own machines. They send the virus to someone else's. Maya: What!? That's horrible! Gumshoe: Oh, I get it... It's like you sneezing on Godot so he catches a cold. Maya: Right! Then he wouldn't be able to turn up in court because he'd be too sick. You really shouldn't do stuff like that, Nick. It's wrong. Phoenix: Who? What? Where? When and why did the conversation jump to talking about me!? Anyway, that's what a computer virus is. A bad program that causes damage. Gumshoe: And all the different viruses have names, right? I kinda feel like I've heard the name of the virus we caught somewhere before. Phoenix: (The name of the virus, huh? I feel like I've heard of it before, too...) MC Bomber (appears after presenting Sports Paper or MC Bomber) Gumshoe: We already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met. Maya: Who are they? Gumshoe: I dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess. Phoenix: And now the virus has been released, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival! Maya: All this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie! Gumshoe: Apparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market. Phoenix: You mean someone put this virus up for sale? Gumshoe: Yeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal. Phoenix: (In the millions!? A virus can be worth that much!?) MC Bomber updated in the Court Record. MC Bomber (subsequent times) Gumshoe: We already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met. Maya: Who are they? Gumshoe: I dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess. Phoenix: And now the virus has been released, huh... Gumshoe: Yeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival! Maya: All this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie! Gumshoe: Apparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market. Phoenix: You mean someone put this virus up for sale? Gumshoe: Yeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal. Phoenix: (In the millions!? A virus can be worth that much!?) The Cadaverinis (appears after presenting Violetta profile) Phoenix: I'm not sure if I really want to get involved in this, but who are the Cadaverinis? Gumshoe: Who are they? A scary bunch of people, that's who! Phoenix: (You're a cop, and you're scared? What's that about?) Gumshoe: Trust me, it doesn't matter if you're kid or a cop, these guys are scary. They've got some serious clout in the criminal underworld. We can't touch them. They've got too much moola. Phoenix: Moola...? As in? Gumshoe: They pretty much control all the cash on the city's black market. Phoenix: The black market, huh? And that includes Tender Lender, I take it? Gumshoe: Sure. No one stands up to Bruto Cadaverini. And I mean, no one! Phoenix: (Interesting...) Maya: So Viola's the granddaughter of some mafia boss then? Gumshoe: Yeah. And everyone know how much Bruto loves his little girl. She means everything to him. Phoenix: So... How did she end up at Tender Lender? Gumshoe: I dunno, pal. But I heard she and the boss of the Tender Lender are pretty tight. Maya: Tight? Gumshoe: That's what it said in a file I read related to Maggey's case. Phoenix: (Sounds like a pretty important clue.) Present Sports Paper or MC Bomber Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, umm... about this... Gumshoe: What!? I'm trying to concentrate on Maggey and this virus right now, so I... Aaaaaaaaaaah!! This is it! This stupid name! I remember now! Phoenix: (I thought so. Here it comes...) Maya: Don't just nod to yourself and keep me in the dark, Nick! What's going on!? Phoenix: It's OK, Maya! You don't have to cry about it! Gumshoe: The name scribbled on that sports paper and written on that CD... That's the name of the virus! \"MC Bomber\"! Maya: WHAT!? Gumshoe: Yeah! The virus that's just infected every computer in the station, pal. It's MC Bomber! Phoenix: Can you give us any more details? Please? Glen Elg profile Gumshoe: This guy was a real programming genius. They called him \"the walking computer\" at the place where he worked. Maya: What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!? Phoenix: (*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!) Gumshoe: Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim. Violetta profile Gumshoe: That's the girl who works over at Tender Lender. You wanna stay away from her, OK? I mean it. Maya: She does look kind of unforgiving, doesn't she? Gumshoe: That should be the least of your worries, pal. Phoenix: (What's that supposed to mean? What could be worse...?) Gumshoe: Her name's Viola Cadaverini. She's the only granddaughter of Bruto Cadaverini. Maya: Bruto Cadaverini? Do you know who that is, Nick? Phoenix: Never heard of him. Gumshoe: Bruto Cadaverini's the boss of the Cadaverini family. Phoenix: The Cadaverinis? (That's one scary-sounding name!) Gumshoe: We can't touch them. They're way too powerful for the police. But you're thinking of taking them on, aren't you? Phoenix: N-No! I don't remember ever saying I was going to! (I better get some more info out of Gumshoe about this \"family\"...) Furio Tigre profile Gumshoe: Oh, this guy... The Tiger... Maya: Is he famous? Gumshoe: Yeah. This guy's not a loan shark, you know. Nope. He's a big loan cat! Phoenix: Hence the name? Gumshoe: Don't pay him back, and you'd better say your prayers, because he'll eat you alive. Maya: You're shaking, Detective. Phoenix: Like a leaf... Gumshoe: I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean. Bruto Cadaverini profile Gumshoe: I wouldn't go flashing that photo around if I were you, pal. Maya: Why not? Gumshoe: That guy rules the criminal underworld. You could get yourselves in serious trouble. I'm talking say-your-prayers trouble. Maya: You're shaking, Detective. Phoenix: Like a leaf... Gumshoe: I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean. After clearing \"MC Bomber\" and \"The Cadaverinis\" Talk options: Gumshoe: Aaaaargh! I can't believe it! I almost forgot the most important thing! Phoenix: A-And that is...? Gumshoe: You know, the lunchbox! How did everything go!? Phoenix: L-Lunchbox? Maya: You remember. The weenies...? Byrde: I hate weenies! Phoenix: (Oh, yeah... Those weenies.) Gumshoe: So? How did my weenies taste when they went down the hatch? Maya: Huh? Um... Well... It was... delicious! Gumshoe: Yeah? That's what she said? Really!? Maya: Umm... Well... Not exactly... Gumshoe: Don't worry about it, pal. I figured something would happen, so I came prepared. Phoenix: Prepared? What do you mean...? Gumshoe: I made a jumbo lunchbox! Maya: Oh... Gumshoe: Do me a favor again, huh, pal, and deliver this? Phoenix: (This sure is a heavy burden... In more ways than one...) Gumshoe: I can just imagine Maggey's little eyes sparkling with joy when you bring her that! Maya: ...Weenies, again, Nick? Tell me we don't have to eat all these too... Gumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya. Again. Maya: I really can't eat any more... Present Gumshoe's Lunchbox Gumshoe: Don't forget to give that to Maggey, OK? Maya: But they don't allow presents for the prisoners in the detention center, right...? Gumshoe: Hey, you're right... ... Well it doesn't matter. I'm counting on you to get it to her somehow. Phoenix: (I'm a lawyer, not a delivery boy, Gumshoe...) Blue Screens, Inc. Talk Glen's troubles (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Basil: Glen's head had more processing power than any computer. But it had been infected with a \"gambling\" virus. Glen was... in too deep. Phoenix: You mean he was in debt? Basil: Yes. 100,000 dollars in debt. Not an easy amount to repay. So... He said he was taking on some extra work. Something a bit risky. Phoenix: \"Risky\"? How? Maya: Maybe he was going to become a waitress at Trés Bien!? Phoenix: (Where do you come up with these ideas!?) Risky extra work (appears after \"Glen's troubles\") Phoenix: So it's safe to say Mr. Elg was the creator of this virus, huh? Basil: The \"MC Bomber\" virus? Yes. It was a work of genius. In a bad sort of way, of course. But still genius. Something like that would probably fetch several million dollars on the black market. Phoenix: (Inconceivable! Gumshoe was right for a change!) This date, December 3rd, that is marked on his calendar... That was his deadline for repaying his debts. MC Bomber updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: (I guess we won't be needing these horse racing tickets any more.) Glen Elg's Losing Horse Racing Tickets thrown back on the floor. Maya: Use the trash can, Nick! Risky extra work (subsequent times) Phoenix: So it's safe to say Mr. Elg was the creator of this virus, huh? Basil: The \"MC Bomber\" virus? Yes. It was a work of genius. In a bad sort of way, of course. But still genius. Something like that would probably fetch several million dollars on the black market. Phoenix: (Inconceivable! Gumshoe was right for a change!) This date, December 3rd, that is marked on his calendar... That was his deadline for repaying his debts. Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Glen's Trouble -- Phoenix: So, how about you tell me what kind of trouble Mr. Elg was in? Basil: I'm sorry, sir, but we don't deal with trouble-shooting here. Perhaps you'd like to speak to someone in customer service? Phoenix: (What's she talking about!? I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...) Ms. Basil. Let me ask you something. Did Mr. Elg's troubles have something to do with this? Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Basil: What is that? Phoenix: A lottery ticket. There were a ton of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime. (Changed from [There were hundreds of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime.] in the original release) Basil: And what is the relevance of that? Phoenix: The victim, Mr. Glen Elg... ...had a gambling habit, didn't he? Basil: I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone dreams of being rich. Even I listen to Millionaire Radio. Phoenix: (She's right. That is a bit weak on its own.) But Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to the lottery, was it? Present Losing Horse Racing Tickets Phoenix: Leads to: \"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: Everyone likes to gamble from time to time. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: But be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc. Phoenix: (Looks like I got that one wrong.) Leads back to: \"I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts.\" Present Losing Horse Racing Tickets Phoenix: Basil: What is that? Phoenix: A bunch of horse racing tickets. All losing ones. Basil: With that many tickets, you could get 1 dollar at the recycling center. You good people are very, very bad. Cashing in on others' misfortunes is immoral. Phoenix: (...Is that a whiff of hypocrisy I smell?) (Changed from [...Why did I get a whiff of hypocrisy just now?] in the original release) Basil: But what is the relevance of these tickets? Phoenix: The victim, Mr. Glen Elg... He had a gambling habit, didn't he? Basil: I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone likes to go to the races from time to time. Phoenix: (Yeah, but not everyone buys this many tickets!) Basil: Anyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own. Phoenix: You're right. But I'm not through yet. Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to horse races, was it? Present Victim's Lottery Ticket Phoenix: Leads to: \"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: Everyone likes to gamble from time to time. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: But be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc. Phoenix: (Looks like I got that one wrong.) Leads back to: \"Anyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!? Basil: I'm not sure. Let's ask one of the programmers... Excuse me. Can you answer this man's query, please? Programmer: The data queue that manages system tasks for trouble-shooting requires that the multi-tasking simulation for local variables be put into sleep mode so that data transmission on active nodes can be bundled correctly according to the source code. ...Obviously. Basil: So I'm afraid that is the situation, you see. Did you good people follow all that? Phoenix: Not even slightly! What was all that mumbo-jumbo? Basil: It is exactly as my programmer explained. Phoenix: (I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.) Basil: Would you like to input another question? Leads back to: \"I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...\" Phoenix: The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times. That's got to have hurt his wallet pretty bad, don't you think? Maybe bad enough to be the cause of some pretty serious trouble perhaps!? Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Basil: You are right. Glen did have a gambling habit. You good people must not follow his example, do you understand? Phoenix: Trust me. Even if I wanted to, I don't exactly have the money to buy any. Basil: But... if you win, there's no problem, is there? And Glen had a winning ticket, didn't he? For half a million dollars? Phoenix: Yeah, but... Basil: It's hard to imagine how he could have been in trouble then, isn't it? Phoenix: It's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end. But that was his first stroke of good luck. He was in deep trouble before that. Basil: Deep trouble? What do you mean? Phoenix: Mr. Elg's real problem was with someone or something more terrifying and ferocious! Present Glen's Calendar Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Elg met with someone on the day he was killed. He even made a note on this calendar about the meeting: \"Meet with The Tiger.\" Basil: What is the relevance of that? Are you trying to suggest Glen was meeting him to discuss his debt? Phoenix: Y-Yeah. That's what I was thinking. Basil: But I have never heard anything about this \"Tiger\" before. Maybe he's not even human. Maybe he really is a tiger! Phoenix: (I'm no programmer, but does she really expect me to buy such messed up logic?) In that case, I think it's time to introduce you to The Tiger. Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\".\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!? Basil: I'm not sure. Let's ask one of the programmers... Excuse me. Can you answer this man's query, please? Programmer: The data queue that manages system tasks for trouble-shooting requires that the multi-tasking simulation for local variables be put into sleep mode so that data transmission on active nodes can be bundled correctly according to the source code. ...Obviously. Basil: So I'm afraid that is the situation, you see. Did you good people follow all that? Phoenix: Not even slightly! What was all that mumbo-jumbo? Basil: It is exactly as my programmer explained. Phoenix: (I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.) Basil: Glen had a lot of friends, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"But I have never heard anything about this \"Tiger\" before.\" Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Phoenix: Furio Tigre... The boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\". Basil: \"Tender Lender\"!? People with businesses should think harder before naming their offices. Phoenix: (Like you're one to talk!) Well? What do you think? Basil: Our firm is doing very well at the moment. I don't think we need to borrow money. Phoenix: No, no, no! I mean about Mr. Elg! Basil: You think Glen had something to do with this Furio Tigre? Phoenix: Yes... Basil: I'm sorry. I don't know of any connection between the two of them. Phoenix: (Really? Because I've got proof that Mr. Elg and The Tiger knew each other.) Present Glen's Calendar Phoenix: Leads to: \"Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\".\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? What do you think!?

Phoenix: (I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.) Basil: Glen had a lot of friends, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"You think Glen had something to do with this Furio Tigre?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: All good people get into trouble sometimes. Phoenix: Huh? Basil: Let's ask one of my programmers what they think... Excuse me? What do you think? Programmer: I'm taking a break. Basil: Yes. Perhaps I should take a break, too. Phoenix: (I wish I could take a break from my troubles, but the rest stop was about a mile back.) Leads back to: \"It's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end.\" Phoenix: Furio Tigre, aka \"The Tiger\", is the boss of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\". This is who Mr. Elg met with on the day of his murder. And the only thing a loan shark would talk with him about would be his debt! Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Basil: It's true that Glen had racked up quite a bit of debt from his gambling habit. About 100,000 dollars, I think. Phoenix: (100,000 dollars? Ouch!) Basil: But I heard he won the lottery, so he should have been in the clear. Phoenix: (Shame Maggey couldn't get a bit of that good luck.) OK... ...So the guy got lucky and won the lottery. But what if he hadn't won? What was his plan then? Basil: Well... This isn't easy to say, but... He said he would use his talents to repay the money. Phoenix: His \"talents\"? Basil: I suspect he was talking about programming. Phoenix: Wh-What computer program is worth 100,000 dollars!? Basil: ... Perhaps you good people should leave so I can get back to my work. Phoenix: (I'm so close to cracking her!) The program in question... Was it by any chance... this!? Present MC Bomber (after clearing \"MC Bomber\" Talk option in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Well? This is it, isn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Basil: This is a very delicate matter. Without the necessary data, there's really no way I can access the information. Phoenix: (I know Mr. Elg created some sort of program! She can't deny it if I show her the program itself as evidence!) Leads back to: \"I'm so close to cracking her!\" Phoenix: Well? This is it, isn't it? This is the virus that's infecting computers world-wide as we speak... \"MC Bomber\"! Basil: Noooooooo! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Tender Lender Talk The head bandage (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Viola: Four months ago... I was in a traffic accident... That's why I needed the operation... When I woke up... they told me it was nothing serious... A simple procedure... Maya: Oh! Really? Phoenix: (Well, I guess if she recovered in 4 months, it couldn't have been too big...) Viola: They said the operation... cost one million dollars... Maya: A... A... A million bucks!? Viola: My grandfather ordered Don Tigre to pay... One million dollars... In \"compensation\"... Maya: \"Compensation\", huh...? Phoenix: It's underworld lingo for paying money to settle a score. Basically, pay or get into some serious trouble! (But a million bucks!? This has to be related to our poisoning case somehow...) Compensation (appears after \"The head bandage\") Leads to: \"I wanted to believe him... I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said...\" Present Magatama Phoenix: 4 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Head Bandage -- Phoenix: You said that bandage around your head was from an operation? Viola: ... Phoenix: You also said you suffered a \"fatal injury\" to the head, correct? Viola: Yes... The operation was very... difficult, apparently... Phoenix: Now, by \"fatal injury\", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right? Viola: ... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: Did the injury in question have something to do with this? Present Repair Bill Phoenix: Leads to: \"I have here a car repair bill.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well!? Viola: Donuts...? Phoenix: Huh? Viola: I baked them myself... Home-made donuts... Have one... Phoenix: Umm, what's inside? Viola: Jam, and... ... Phoenix: I'm sorry, but I didn't quite catch that... Viola: Hee... Hee... Phoenix: Um... Thanks, but no thanks... I think I'll pass. (I guess that was a flop. What happened to this woman for her to have such a huge bandage around her head? There must be some piece of evidence that'll prompt her to tell me what happened...) Leads back to: \"Now, by \"fatal injury\", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right?\" Phoenix: I have here a car repair bill. From this, it seems pretty obvious that this car was involved in an accident. Viola: Let me see that... ... This bill is made out to the \"Cadaverinis\"...? Phoenix: Y-Yes, it is. Viola: I don't think... I ever introduced myself... Tell me... what do the \"Cadaverinis\"... have to do with me...? Phoenix: (Something tells me she's not about to say hi and introduce herself... Alright, then...) Your relationship with the Cadaverinis is very strong... And this is why. Present Viola Cadaverini or Bruto Cadaverini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I know exactly who you are, Viola Cadaverini!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: So!? What do have to say for herself now!? Viola: Pretzels... For you... Phoenix: Huh? Viola: Don't worry about the little white specks on the surface... I just sprinkled a small quantity of... ... Phoenix: ...N-No thanks! (My evidence must still be half-baked...) Viola: I really don't know... the \"Cadaverinis\"... Further... Leads back to: \"I don't think... I ever introduced myself...\" Phoenix: I know exactly who you are, Viola Cadaverini! You sustained that injury in a traffic accident, didn't you? Viola: ... 1 LOCK BROKEN Viola: It happened about 4 months ago... I was driving in one of our family's cars... when someone pulled out in front of me... It was a motorbike... or something like that... I don't remember it much... Anyway, I swerved to try to avoid it, but... ...I took a blow... to the head... A bad one. Phoenix: (Yeah, I can imagine...) So what happened to the person on the bike? I'm guessing they didn't get away with injuring THE Viola Cadaverini, right? Viola: I... don't know... what happened to them... They ran away... Or so I heard... Phoenix: Ran away? Viola: If they'd stayed, I'd have... Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: (Hmm, is it possible...? Could the person who committed the hit and run have been...?) Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"It was this man, wasn't it? He was the cause of your accident.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: The person who caused the accident that gave you that injury was-- Viola: No more.. I don't want to... think about it anymore... Here... try one of these tomatoes... We all picked them together... as a family... And I added my own, special, flavoring... Phoenix: N-No thanks! (The person who caused the accident was riding a motorbike... Who could it be?) Leads back to: \"Hmm, is it possible...? Could the person who committed the hit and run have been...?\" Phoenix: It was this man, wasn't it? He was the cause of your accident. Viola: ... It wasn't Don Tigre! I refuse to believe it! 1 LOCK BROKEN Viola: We collided... The motorbike, and my car... But Don Tigre isn't injured at all... is he? Phoenix: (It was The Tiger who caused Viola to crash. I can feel it! Plus, one of her locks just broke, so she must suspect it was him, too...) I'm sorry, Ms. Cadaverini... But I have proof that The Tiger was involved in a traffic accident on his bike! Present Scooter Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's not exactly a motorbike, but...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: And this is my proof! Viola: Hard-boiled eggs...? Please, try one... Phoenix: E-Eggs? Viola: I raised the chickens and these eggs came from myself... I invented a special diet... so their chicks would be blue... Phoenix: N-No, thanks! Leads back to: \"It was The Tiger who caused Viola to crash. I can feel it!\" Phoenix: It's not exactly a motorbike, but... ...Mr. Tigre rides around in a scooter, doesn't he? And you'll notice that the front wheel guard is badly damaged. Viola: ... Phoenix: Ms. Cadaverini... You know the truth, don't you? Viola: ... Hee... Hee... Hee... 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: This repair bill was paid by Furio Tigre. The Cadaverinis have known for ages who caused the accident, haven't they? Viola: ... It's possible... Perhaps... Somewhere inside me... I know that may be true... Phoenix: (I knew it...) Viola: But... Don Tigre still saved my life... The operation was very complicated... It was very, very expensive... Phoenix: How much are we talking? Viola: ... Very, very, very expensive... Phoenix: (She seems kind of hesitant about giving me an actual figure. I should back off...) Well, anyway, it was The Tiger who paid for it, right? Viola: After I recovered... Don Tigre told me... He said he paid for the operation because... he cared about me... I... believe him... Phoenix: Really? But do you honestly believe that to be true? Viola: ... Phoenix: Do you want to know what I think...? I think the reason he paid the operation wasn't because of you, but someone else... Present Bruto Cadaverini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Perhaps I shouldn't be saying this, but...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: I know this must be quite a shock for you, but... Viola: Overcoat...? Phoenix: S-Sorry? Viola: I made it myself... It's been so... cold lately... Phoenix: (Yeah, just hearing your voice sends shivers down my spine!) Viola: Please, try it on... ... ...Oops! Phoenix: ... What was the \"oops\" for? Viola: I'm missing a few pins... I must have left them in the coat... Phoenix: O-On second thought, I'm fine, thanks! Roasty-toasty, that's me! Viola: Don Tigre told me, you see... Leads back to: \"He said he paid for the operation because... he cared about me...\" Phoenix: Perhaps I shouldn't be saying this, but... ...your grandfather, Bruto Cadaverini, controls a lot of \"dubious\" cash, right? And you are his beloved pride and joy. Viola: ... Phoenix: Sure, I don't know exactly how much the operation cost, but... ...if you weren't the granddaughter of Mr. Cadaverini... ...do you think Mr. Tigre would have paid the money? Viola: ... One million dollars... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Bruto Cadaverini profile Phoenix: This man is your grandfather, right? Viola: Carrying a picture like that around with you... You should watch your back... Phoenix: Th-Thanks for the advice... Viola: The family is always watching me... from the shadows... Phoenix: (The \"family\"?) Maya: I thought I saw something suspicious under the corner of that rug! Viola: One wrong move and... you might disappear forever... Hee... Hee... Hee... Phoenix: (This feels like Halloween... Only a whole lot more real... And a whole lot scarier, too.) Viola: I wanted to believe him... I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said... He said it had nothing to do with my grandfather being Bruto Cadaverini... I wanted to believe he helped me because he cared about me. Not about my grandfather... But I knew... That wasn't really true... Maya: Wow. I'm so sorry. Viola: What he did to get the money was... It was... evil! Phoenix: ...! Viola: He said it was all for me... So I... I helped him... Maya: You helped him? In what way? Viola: Here... Take these... Phoenix: (What are these? Medical papers?) Viola: I'm Bruto Cadaverini's granddaughter... He had to pay compensation... He was made an offer... He simply... couldn't... refuse. Viola's Medical Papers added to the Court Record. Maya: Wow, I feel so bad for Viola. Phoenix: It's inexcusable! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: (There are two things that I consider inexcusable. Poisoning, and betrayal! Only a coward would hurt people using either of these tactics.) Maya: Is everything alright, Nick? Phoenix: We should get going. Right after we finish our espresso. Maya: Yeah. Phoenix: (I wouldn't need to convince Viola of anything else, so I guess I can get rid of this.) Repair Bill thrown into the trash. After clearing \"Risky extra work\" Talk option in Blue Screens, Inc. and clearing \"Compensation\" Talk option in Tender Lender: January 7Trés Bien Armstrong: Eh, bonjour! I 'ave been waiting for you to return. Maya: Mr. Armstrong... Phoenix: Ah, good timing. I was hoping to find you here. We'd like to ask you a few questions... ???: Well, he hasn't got anythin' to say to youse fellas! Maya: Ah! It's Xin Eohp... Tigre: Who you callin' \"Zinnee Ooooope\"!? Maya: Aaaaah! Phoenix: (Come out from under the table already, Maya!) Tigre: OK. Hand it over! Phoenix: Wh-What? Tigre: Youse wanna play games wid me? I don't recommend dat! The medical papers! Now! Phoenix: (Uh, oh... I think he wants Viola Cadaverini's papers back...) Y-You mean... this? The million dollar medical papers? Tigre: ... Phoenix: Ms. Cadaverini trusted you. That's why she said that she helped you. Tigre: Forget about it! That girl's dumber dan an eggplant. Youse wanna know what's sad? I'll tell youse what's sad. And it ain't only her face. She thinks she's got power cuz she's Bruto's little girl... Now THAT's sad... Phoenix: I can't let you have these papers. Tomorrow in court... ...I'm going to expose what you did to get the one million you used to pay this off! Tigre: ... Are you crazy or somethin'!? I don't care if you wanna give it to me or not! There's two of us here. You got dat? Two. Armstrong: Err... oui! Oui, oui! Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong!? Armstrong: Forgive me! Désolé! I cannot argue wiz 'im! Phoenix: U-Urgh! (...That... really hurt!) Tigre: Is dat all youse got? I'll be takin' dose papers now. Armstrong! Get that lighter! Phoenix: W-Wait...! Tigre: Don't take it too hard... ...Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (That was so stupid... I shouldn't... have let my guard down. Those medical papers were... vital... evi...dence...) Hold it, pal! Phoenix: D-Detective Gumshoe!? Tigre: D-Detective!? Youse think you gonna stop me, copper!? Beat it! Gwaaaaaaaaaaar! Gumshoe: Whoa! C-Come on, Gumshoe! Keep it together! You guys! Get outta here! Leave this guy to me. Phoenix: B-But... Gumshoe: Go, pal! And take this! If you get hurt, who'd look after Maggey, huh!? Phoenix: ...! A-Alright! Thanks, Gumshoe! Maya: Wait, Nick! Don't leave me behind! Phoenix: (I'll get even with that guy tomorrow... in court! Tender Lender is going down!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- At Trés Bien --Tigre: I was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the meeting wasn't due to take place at Tender Lender at all then? Tigre: The kid was makin' a fuss about comin' into de office. It's always that way when I wanna talk about repayments. Even though I got the best punching bag you' ever seen if there are any \"issues\". Phoenix: (Maybe it's because of the punching bag that people are scared to come?) So that's why you decided to meet at Trés Bien? Godot: Godot: Ha...! You're going over old ground again, Trite. Phoenix: S-Sorry. Godot: You just earned yourself a penalty. Now suck it down! Judge: You will suck down the penalty, Mr. Wright. And you will like it! Phoenix: (Thank you, sir, may I have another!)Tigre: When I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: An \"ugly scene\"? What do you mean? Godot: Godot: The witness has already told us, Trite. Which makes that question... irrelevant! Phoenix: B-But...! Godot: I limit myself to 17 cups of coffee during a trial. That's the rule. You better limit the number of times you take a penalty, Trite. Or your guts will look like the inside of a chimney! Ashen! Judge: Don't make me burn you again, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (I guess I shouldn't have pressed him on that.) Tigre: Guess I'm gonna make that special express after all. Judge: So, to recap... This \"ugly scene\" you saw was...?Present Trés Bien Floor Plans Phoenix: Leads to: \"You're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?\"Tigre: The guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean you saw Glen Elg's dead body? Tigre: I guess I did. But I only saw him from behind. He was wearin' some raggy bit of cloth he called a hat. Phoenix: And what time was this? Tigre: I dunno. Phoenix: Huh? Tigre: You' know what winds me up more than anythin' else in the world? Watches! Round watches! I ain't gonna pollute my paws wid some tickin' henpecker! Judge: Out of interest, Mr. Tigre, what winds you up the second most? Tigre: Huh? Whad'youse think!? Square watches! Phoenix: (Is this guy for real!?) Tigre: Look, all I need to know was that somethin' bad was goin' down in that place.Present Trés Bien Floor Plans Phoenix: Leads to: \"You're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?\"Tigre: I figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you didn't actually set foot inside the restaurant, then? Tigre: The Tiger is a busy cat. I don't hang around for no one. I ain't got time to be caught up in no murder investigation. Phoenix: So, when exactly did you pick up the matches? Godot: There are matches just inside the front door. Our detective friend wound up in trouble with the chef after taking 5 books home. Phoenix: (Poor Gumshoe... It's almost enough to make a man cry...)Tigre: I heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You went straight back? Did a bout of guilt suddenly hit you for what you did? Tigre: What're youse trying to say!? You' tryin' to tell me youse ain't never been guilty of nothin'? Phoenix: Um... Godot: We all have our crosses to bear. We all have to swallow the dark secrets we hide... ...Like this! Phoenix: (The courtroom's not exactly the place to talk about dark secrets, is it?) Judge: It seems you've done it again, Mr. Wright. Another irrelevant line of questioning. I must impose a penalty accordingly! Phoenix: (How about a penalty for those two jokers and the garbage they keep coming up with!?)Maya: Well, Nick? What do you think?Phoenix: He's running out of ways to avoid the truth. I need to press him fast before he has time to think things through. I've got to come right back at him with a contradiction!Maya: Be careful what you press him on, though, or you'll get penalized, OK?Phoenix: You're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?Tigre: No one escapes The Tiger's clutches!Phoenix: Well I'm something of a lie detecting pro.Tigre: ...Phoenix: And no one escapes The Phoenix's clutches! I think it's time we got something straight.Godot: What's this, Trite? A new line of irrelevant questioning?Phoenix: These are the floor plans of the crime scene. You say you were standing at the entrance, Mr. Tigre? From there, your field of vision would have covered an area something like... this.Judge: Indeed. The witness would have had a clear view of the victim's seat.Tigre: Isn't that what I just said? I saw the back of the kid's head.Phoenix: Unfortunately for you, that is not possible. If the court would think back, you'll remember that between each of the tables... ...is a tall partition!Judge: Why...! That's true!Phoenix: Now look at the plans again! The truth is painfully obvious! From the entrance, the field of vision of any customer walking in... ...ends here!Tigre: ...Phoenix: So, from the entrance of Trés Bien, you couldn't have seen the victim's seat. But you did see the victim that day... because you met with him!Godot:Godot: Wrong! Have you forgotten the old man's testimony yesterday? The victim was alone at his table.Phoenix:Phoenix: But the defense just proved that point to be moot! The \"victim\" witnessed by Mr. Kudo was not Glen Elg, but a fake!Godot: What!?Phoenix: In order to have Mr. Kudo falsely testify... ...the real killer posed as the victim he had just killed and acted out a charade!Judge: That will do! This trial has gone on long enough without the obvious question being answered. Who exactly was this \"real killer\" who impersonated the victim?Phoenix: ...!Judge: You say the killer murdered Glen Elg... ...and then impersonated his victim in a performance for Victor Kudo? In that case, Mr. Wright, reveal the identity of this \"criminal\" to the court!Present Furio Tigre profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Obviously...\"Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Obviously, it's the person you least expect! Um... What's the matter, Your Honor? Judge: Oh, nothing! I just dropped my pen again. Don't mind me. Carry on with the proceedings as normal. Maya: Better think again while he's down there, Nick. Phoenix: (I guess I should've picked the obvious choice...) Judge: Very good. I've found my pen now. So, allow me to pose the question again, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"You say the killer murdered Glen Elg...\"Phoenix: Obviously... ...the killer is Furio Tigre! No one else could have done it.Judge: Wh-What!? Well, witness?Tigre: ... Grrrah ha hah! Now that's cute! Youse think you can pin this on The Tiger!? Maybe youse don't understand. The Tiger is king of the jungle! So I dares you' to say it again! Come on! You' got the guts!?Judge: Y-Y-You can't threaten m-me, Mr. Tigre! I-It's the defense! Go ahead and tell the witness, Mr. Wright! Mr. Wriiight!Tigre: Sounds to me like it must be you', old man. Youse got guts, I'll give you that.Judge: M-M-Mr. Wright! Do not leave me to handle this alone!Godot: ...Ha...! Perhaps I can end this embarrassment.Judge: M-Mr. Godot!Godot: Let's just go back over Mr. Kudo's testimony one more time. The old man didn't see just the victim! Oh, no, no, no.Kudo: The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there!Godot: Was the victim he saw the real victim or not? That doesn't matter. The fact remains, he saw the accused put the poison into the coffee!Judge: ...! Yes, it was the waitress who poisoned the coffee--Phoenix:Phoenix: V-Very impressive, Mr. Godot. ...Waiting for my absence to launch your attack!Godot: Ha...! Found your pen at last, Trite?Phoenix: It was in my pocket. *ahem* But anyway... Mr. Kudo witnessed two people that day. He saw the victim, the \"supposed\" Mr. Glen Elg, and the \"waitress\"... from behind.Judge: Yes... Your point, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: I think the conclusion is obvious. If this \"Glen Elg\" was really the killer in disguise... ...then surely it's possible the \"waitress\" was also part of the show.Judge: What!? You mean, the waitress was an imposter as well!?Phoenix: The defendant, Ms. Byrde, fell unconscious immediately after the incident. And someone used her fainting to hatch an elaborate plan to pin the murder on her!Judge: Who on earth was it!? Who was this \"waitress\" that Mr. Kudo witnessed?Present Viola Cadaverini profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"W-Who is this woman?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Obviously, it's the person you least expect! Um... What's the matter, Your Honor? Judge: Oh, nothing! I just dropped my pen again. Don't mind me. Carry on with the proceedings as normal. Maya: Better think again while he's down there, Nick. Phoenix: (I guess I should've picked the obvious choice...) Judge: Very good. I've found my pen now. So, allow me to pose the question again, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"Who on earth was it!?\"Judge: W-Who is this woman?Phoenix: Her name is Viola Cadaverini. She's an employee of Tender Lender.Tigre: Youse makin' a big mistake... D'you know who Violetta's grandfather is? You' betta be goin' home in an armored truck tonight, if you' know what I mean...Phoenix: ...Maya: Stop shaking, Nick!Phoenix: Wh-Where was I? Yes, the defendant, Ms. Byrde, has stated the following...Byrde: Well, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant.Byrde: Umm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh.Tigre: ...Phoenix: There are just too many contradictions in this case. The \"second man\" at the victim's table who nobody but Ms. Byrde seems to have seen. The earpiece worn by the victim in his left ear when that eardrum was ruptured! And the radio show he was supposedly listening to half an hour after it was over. There is only one logical explanation that clears up all of these contradictions! The whole incident took place twice! Once for real, and once for show! And, Mr. Furio Tigre, the only person who could have committed the crime... ...was you!Tigre: ... ......Judge: W-Witness? What have you got to say?Tigre: ... That's cute!Judge: S-Sorry?Tigre: Youse alright. I could do with a guy like you' around.Phoenix: Wh-What do you mean?Tigre: OK, I'm in on this game! I'm gonna have to charter a jet to get me to my meetin' now, but... ...I'm gonna give youse one more thing to think about before I go.Phoenix: Something to think about?Tigre: Youse got it all wrapped up nice, huh, Wright? But youse missed out one real important thing!Phoenix: But that can't be!Tigre: I was in the joint that day. And I met that kid, too.Phoenix: ...!Tigre: But I couldn't have poisoned him, youse hear?Judge: What!? Do you really expect us to believe you now, Mr. Tigre?Godot: Ha...! What a troublemaker.Phoenix: T-Troublemaker...?Godot: Looks like we're going to need another one for the road. One more steaming cup of hot testimony!Judge: Indeed. Witness, you will explain yourself to the court. I will give you one more chance to testify. What happened that day at Trés Bien between yourself and the victim?Witness Testimony-- Ties to the Victim --Tigre: Yeah, I loaned Elg cash. About 100,000 dollars. That day, we was due to have a little chat. The kid had hit his payback date, see? So anyway, he tells me he's got no way to pay up. I'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'. \"Yesss! I won! Half a million bucks!\" He got lucky, you' know. Real lucky. If that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.Judge: Now, I see that the principal amount you loaned to Mr. Elg was 50,000 dollars...Tigre: Yeah, well. Youse got the vig to take into account. Interest builds up fast, you' know.Phoenix: (That's faster than fast! 100,000 dollars is twice his principal!)Judge: And the repayment deadline was December 3rd, the day of the incident in question.Tigre: Yeah. He was one lucky kid! He got that half a million just in time. So I ain't have no reason to kill the kid. And if I ain't got no motive, you ain't got no case!Phoenix: (His motive? Hmm... He has to have one, but what is it?)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Ties to the Victim --Tigre: Yeah, I loaned Elg cash. About 100,000 dollars.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did he have any way of paying the loan back? Tigre: The fool was a gambler. He said he couldn't give it up 'til he landed a big win. So I agreed to help him. Judge: Help him? You? Tigre: I kept hittin' him with ideas for ways he could getta big win. But the guy kept losin'. Phoenix: So you were helping him for his sake? Or yours? Tigre: \"Win Through Compromise\"! Youse help me, I help youse! What's the difference, huh? Phoenix: (...I don't believe this!) Maya: Nick, would anyone really ever loan money to someone they thought was unreliable? Like, for example, if it were you, I'd only loan you five bucks, max. Phoenix: (Thanks a lot, Maya.)Tigre: That day, we was due to have a little chat. The kid had hit his payback date, see?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So how much were you expecting him to pay you back on that day? Tigre: What d'youse think!? The whole package! $100,000, including interest. Maya: That's a real heavyweight punch! Tigre: Once a client misses a repayment, you' call the whole loan in. You' wanna make it in my world, that's all youse gotta know. Judge: And how many times had Mr. Elg been late with his repayments? Tigre: Once. Phoenix: And how much was he supposed to pay back every month? Tigre: 50 bucks. Maya: Sounds like Mr. Elg was in a real sticky spot. Phoenix: (Yeah, at 50 dollars a month, he'd never pay that huge loan off!)Tigre: So anyway, he tells me he's got no way to pay up.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How much did he have left on his debt? Tigre: You want it in round figures? About 100,000 bucks. Phoenix: (That's the whole amount!) Godot: We're talking about a guy who had 58 cents in his wallet. Tigre: What!? Youse tellin' me he wasn't even gonna pay for the coffee!? Judge: He certainly seems to have been a brave man, this Mr. Elg. Tigre: That guy was smooth, I tell youse. Real smooth! \"You'll have your money in less than 5 minutes!\" That's what he says to me. The guy then calls me the \"Tender Tiger\". He was skatin' on thin ice with me!Tigre: I'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was that because he...? Tigre: The guy won the lottery. Was his last chance at a big win. Judge: And you confirm that this is the ticket in question? Tigre: ...That's it. Judge: The \"Millionaire Radio\" show starts at 1:30 PM and runs for 10 minutes... That fixes the time you two met with some accuracy. Phoenix: (And the whole scene was acted out again 30 minutes later. All so that Mr. Kudo would see it!) Tigre: I can still see the kid's face now. I ain't never gonna forget it.Tigre: \"Yesss! I won! Half a million bucks!\" He got lucky, you' know. Real lucky.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was there anyone else in the restaurant at the time? Tigre: I don't remember. Phoenix: (If there was no one there, I'll wear that ridiculous tiger shirt for a month! Mr. Armstrong, Maggey and if I'm right, Viola Cadaverini, were all there at that time.) Judge: So, the victim had intended to repay you from his lottery winnings from the beginning? Tigre: Seems dat way to me. Judge: B-But you wouldn't normally expect to win the lottery, would you!? Godot: Ha...! The undying belief that your next roll will end the worst losing streak you ever had... That's what defines a true gambler. Phoenix: (He makes it sound so cool...) Maya: Don't be tempted, Nick! You haven't got the will-power for it! Tigre: All I know is, the kid took a shot and he got lucky in the end.Tigre: If that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The waitress. You mean...? Tigre: The girl with the glasses in the defendant's chair! Who else could I mean!? If she hadn't got in the way, things woulda been, bada-bing, bada-boom, over and done with! Phoenix: (Maybe I should push a little on this...) Ask about what Maggey did Phoenix: What exactly are you implying the defendant did? Tigre: How about you go ask four-eyes about that half a million dollar ticket! She wanted it so bad... ...she poisoned Elg's coffee. Phoenix: Phoenix: A likely theory! Your word hasn't held water lately, Mr. Tigre. Godot: Godot: Let's not forget this witness was actually at the scene, Trite. Tigre: The law don't exactly agree with some of the deals I send down. I couldn't be there when de cops showed up, so I split. Judge: I-I see... Godot: Your Honor! The witness's last few statements are worth a good two cups of coffee. Judge: I concur, Mr. Godot! You will amend your testimony accordingly, witness! Tigre: Ha ha ha! So that's what youse after, Phoenix Wright! Changes statement from \"If that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.\" to \"Thanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!\" Ask how things would've been Phoenix: What do you mean things would have been over and done with? Tigre: Are youse all there or what!? I'm talkin' about the cash! I was there to get my 100,000 bucks back. That's all. I'm a business man. It was all comin' together before that waitress got in the way. Judge: Hmm... As far as I can tell from the witness's testimony... ...other than recouping his loan, Mr. Tigre had no motive for killing the victim. Witness! You will amend your testimony to reflect what you just said. Phoenix: (The Tiger's motive, huh...) Changes statement from \"If that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.\" to \"I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\"Tigre: Thanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: (The Tiger's trying to pin the crime on Maggey. If I ask him about what he saw, it's only going to damage our case.) What do you mean things would have been over and done with? Tigre: Are youse all there or what!? I'm talkin' about the cash! I was there to get my 100,000 bucks back. That's all. I'm a business man. It was all comin' together before that waitress got in the way. Judge: Hmm... As far as I can tell from the witness's testimony... ...other than recouping his loan, Mr. Tigre had no motive for killing the victim. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you happy with the testimony, or would you like it amended? Leave it Phoenix: (I better leave it at that and try to figure something out...) Thank you, Your Honor, but there is no need to amend the testimony. Judge: Very well. Continue with your cross-examination, then. Leads back to cross-examination Have it amended Phoenix: (I'm not going to get anywhere with the testimony as it stands...) Your Honor, the defense would like the testimony amended. Judge: Very well. Witness! You will amend your testimony to reflect your recent statements, please. Changes statement from \"Thanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!\" to \"I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\"Tigre: I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you saying you had no other motives that day? Tigre: Yeah, so what? Godot: Then why didn't you take the lottery ticket when you left? Tigre: Why d'youse think!? Because of four-eyes over there! Phoenix: (Because of Maggey!?) Tigre: How about you go ask four-eyes about that half a million dollar ticket! She wanted it so bad... ...she poisoned Elg's coffee. Phoenix: Phoenix: A likely theory! Your word hasn't held water lately, Mr. Tigre. Godot: Godot: Let's not forget this witness was actually at the scene, Trite. Tigre: The law don't exactly agree with some of the deals I send down. I couldn't be there when de cops showed up, so I split. Judge: I-I see... Godot: Your Honor! The witness's last few statements are worth a good two cups of coffee. Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Are you happy with the testimony, or would you like it amended? Leave it Phoenix: (I better leave it at that and try to figure something out...) Thank you, Your Honor, but there is no need to amend the testimony. Judge: Very well. Continue with your cross-examination, then. Leads back to cross-examination Have it amended Phoenix: (I'm not going to get anywhere with the testimony as it stands...) Your Honor, the defense would like the testimony amended. Judge: Very well. Witness! You will amend your testimony to reflect your recent statements, please. Changes statement from \"I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\" to \"Thanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!\"Present Sports Paper or MC Bomber Phoenix: Phoenix: So you just intended to get back the 100,000 dollars Mr. Elg owed you, correct? Tigre: I loaned the guy the cash, so that's my right. Phoenix: Unfortunately for Mr. Elg... I don't believe the 100,000 dollars is what you were after. Godot: Godot: What are you getting at, Trite? What else would a moneylender be after other than money!? Phoenix: Oh, the moneylender was after money. But money in a totally different league. The kind of money that a single disc like this would fetch! Tigre: ...! Judge: What is that? Phoenix: A computer virus, Your Honor. A virus called \"MC Bomber\"! Judge: A \"computer virus\"? What does one of those do? Phoenix: A computer virus is a program that wreaks havoc on the insides of a computer. Judge: A \"computer\"? What does one of those do? Phoenix: (I guess the beard isn't the only part of His Honor that is from the stone age!) I'll explain it to you later, Your Honor. Right now, this is the important point... A virus like \"MC Bomber\" would be worth several million dollars on the black market. Judge: S-Several million dollars!? Phoenix: Lending money with no hope of ever seeing repayment would normally be bad for business. But in this case, the very fact that Glen Elg had no way to repay the money is crucial. Judge: What!? Phoenix: Glen Elg was a programmer. A highly skilled programmer. That skill was the collateral Mr. Elg put up in order to borrow the money. Tigre: ... Godot: Godot: You're trying to suggest the witness's motive was to get hold of that program? Phoenix: Exactly. Godot: The witness may be poor fashion sense, but he is by no means an idiot, Trite. A man like him could get his hands on one million dollars without resorting to murder. Phoenix: Of course he could... Provided that he had time. But what if he had needed the money right then? When the pressure's on, the luxury of choice tends to disappear. Judge: It seems you have a logical conclusion for this theory, Mr. Wright. Would you care to share it with us? Why did Mr. Tigre need money to the tune of one million dollars? Present Viola's Medical Papers Phoenix: Leads to: \"In December of last year, you found yourself in need of a huge amount of money.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!? Godot: It's evidence... that Trite has no idea what he's doing. Phoenix: What!? What do you mean? Godot: You're way off track, Trite. That evidence is irrelevant! Phoenix: (Since when did he have the right to dish out penalties?) Maya: A-Are you alright, Nick? Phoenix: 100,000 dollars wasn't enough for Mr. Tigre. He needed much more money than that. And in a hurry! Leads back to: \"It seems you have a logical conclusion for this theory, Mr. Wright.\" Phoenix: In December of last year, you found yourself in need of a huge amount of money. Tigre: ...! Phoenix: About 6 months ago, you were involved in a traffic accident, weren't you? An accident involving a car and a scooter, in which a young woman was injured. She was taken to the hospital, where she underwent surgery. Tigre: H-How muccha dis... do youse know...!? (Changed from [Wh-Where did youse get all this info...?] in the original release) Phoenix: These medical papers document the treatment of the young woman in question. According to these, her operation cost... one million dollars! And yet, when the payment was due last month, you somehow managed to pay it in full! (Changed from [Payment for these expenses was due in December of last year, and was paid in full!] in the original release) Judge: O-One million dollars!? A preposterous sum! Someone should sue these HMOs! Godot: Ha...! No one would pay a bill like that. If the medical association got wind of it, the hospital would end up as dead as a morgue. Phoenix: But Mr. Tigre had no choice but to pay! Because his very life depended on it! Tigre: Grrraaaaaaaargh! Judge: O-Order! Order! Order! You say his very life depended on it, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Indeed it did. Simply because the injured woman was none other than Viola Cadaverini. Godot: ...! Did you say, \"Cadaverini\"? Phoenix: Bruto Cadaverini, Mob boss in charge of all underworld activities in the city, and... ...doting grandfather to his precious \"Violetta\", also known as Viola Cadaverini. Godot: Bwooooar! Phoenix: Your life was in danger unless you paid \"compensation\" to the boss, correct? It makes sense! You were desperate to acquire the one million dollars Cadaverini demanded of you! So desperate, in fact, that you decided to sacrifice Glen Elg's life to pay your debt! Leads to: \"On the day of the murder, Mr. Tigre's sole intention was to get his hands on this CD!\"Present Viola's Medical Papers Phoenix: Phoenix: So you just intended to get back the 100,000 dollars Mr. Elg owed you, correct? Tigre: I loaned the guy the cash, so that's my right. Phoenix: Unfortunately for Mr. Elg... ...100,000 dollars wasn't enough to cover it, wasn't it? Tigre: Huh? Phoenix: About 6 months ago, you were involved in a traffic accident, weren't you? An accident involving a car and a scooter, in which a young woman was injured. She was taken to the hospital, where she underwent surgery. Tigre: H-How muccha dis... do youse know...!?

So desperate, in fact, that you decided to sacrifice Glen Elg's life to pay your debt! Judge: Order! Order! Order! What do you say to that, witness? Tigre: ...Grrr... urgh... Godot: Godot: It's a nice little fairy tale, Trite. But even if the witness did need a million dollars... ...that doesn't tie him to Mr. Elg's murder. Mr. Elg only owed him 100,000 dollars, and had no hope of repaying it anyway! Tigre: Yeah. That guy wasn't worth my spit! Phoenix: Phoenix: I don't think so. In fact, the opposite is true. Godot: The opposite? Phoenix: Lending money with no hope of ever seeing repayment would normally be bad for business. But... In this case, the very fact that Glen Elg had no way to repay the money is crucial. Judge: What!? Maya: Do you know where you're going with this, Nick? Phoenix: You've got to think outside the box, Maya. Maya: Outside the box? Phoenix: It's very straightforward. Mr. Tigre wasn't after the 100,000 dollars at all. Judge: It seems you have a logical conclusion for this theory, Mr. Wright. Would you care to share it with us? What exactly was Mr. Tigre \"after\"? Present Sports Paper or MC Bomber Phoenix: Leads to: \"Glen was a programmer. A highly skilled programmer.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!? Godot: It's evidence... that Trite has no idea what he's doing. Phoenix: What!? What do you mean? Godot: You're way off track, Trite. That evidence is irrelevant! Phoenix: (Since when did he have the right to dish out penalties?) Maya: A-Are you alright, Nick? Phoenix: Mr. Tigre needed one million dollars. Recovering a loan 100,000 dollars wasn't enough. (Besides, Elg had the means to make that kind of money if he wanted to.) Leads back to: \"It seems you have a logical conclusion for this theory, Mr. Wright.\" Phoenix: Glen was a programmer. A highly skilled programmer. That skill was the collateral Mr. Elg put up in order to borrow the money. Godot: Care to explain how skill can be used as collateral to secure a loan, Trite? Phoenix: He had the skill to create a computer virus, and so he did. A virus known as \"MC Bomber\"! Judge: A \"computer virus\"? What does one of those do? Phoenix: A computer virus is a program that wreaks havoc on the insides of a computer. Judge: A \"computer\"? What does one of those do? Phoenix: (I guess the beard isn't the only part of His Honor that is from the stone age!) I'll explain it to you later, Your Honor. Right now, this is the important point... A virus like \"MC Bomber\" would be worth several million dollars on the black market. Mr. Tigre! You couldn't have cared less about the 100,000 dollars! Isn't that right? All you cared about was one thing! The virus! Tigre: Grrr... Grrraaaaaaaaaaaargh! Leads to: \"On the day of the murder, Mr. Tigre's sole intention was to get his hands on this CD!\"Maya: So The Tiger was meeting Glen Elg to get his money back. If Mr. Elg had just given him the lottery ticket, that would have been the end of it.Phoenix: Yeah, so what's The Tiger's motive? (This is the big one. If I don't manage to undermine this testimony, it's all over for us.) Why would he have to poison Mr. Elg? And why did he loan him the money in the first place, when he knew he couldn't repay him?\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Evidence 15 (Apron) and Evidence 16 (Potassium Cyanide) both show that Maggey Byrde’s fingerprints were found on the apron and the poison bottle found in the apron pocket, which supports the prosecution case that Maggey was involved.\n\nTestimony 5 \"If that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.\" by Tigre implies Maggey poisoned Glen Elg’s coffee.\n\nTestimony 6 \"Thanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!\" is a softened or amended version but still implies Maggey’s involvement.\n\nTestimony 7 \"I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\" attempt to absolve Tigre of the murder, saying he had no motive to kill.\n\nThe conflict arises between Tigre’s statements that Maggey poisoned the victim (Testimony 5 and 6) and the evidence that the potassium cyanide was found in Maggey’s apron pocket and on the coffee cup with her fingerprints, but she passed out at the time, so the poison could have been planted.\n\nHowever, we need to pick one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other strictly.\n\nLooking at Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup): The coffee contained potassium cyanide, with the victim’s and Maggey’s fingerprints.\n\nTestimony 7 says Tigre: \"I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\"\n\nBut the evidence is that Maggey's fingerprints are on the coffee cup with the poison.\n\nHence the evidence and Tigre's testimony about having no other reason to kill are in conflict.\n\nAlternatively, the conflict between Evidence 11 (Tres Bien Floor Plans) and Testimony 5 (Tigre's claim that if the waitress hadn't done what she did, everything would be over) can be examined regarding visibility and existence of the waitress.\n\nBut between the direct evidence and testimony contrasting the motive and actual proof of involvement, the strongest contradiction is Claim 7 (Tigre saying no motive to kill) vs Evidence 16 (Potassium cyanide with Maggey's fingerprints).\n\nHence, I choose:\n",

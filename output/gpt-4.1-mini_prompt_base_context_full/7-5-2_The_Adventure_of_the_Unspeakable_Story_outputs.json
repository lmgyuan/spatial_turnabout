Sholmes' cry pierced through the thick wall of fog around us. Wisps of vapour flowed over the pistol as I cocked it, and I waited breathlessly in the stillness. The silence lasted for what seemed an eternity until, at last, it appeared. From the shadows of the cloud, an enormous beast sprang out upon us. A hound it was, but not such a hound as any mortal has ever seen. Its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, the whole of its ox-sized body was outlined in white-hot flames. Its rumbling pant and hideous howl... So terrified was I that I began to tremble with fear. 'Look well, Wilson!' Sholmes declared, gazing upon the mystical beast. 'For this! This is the diabolical Hound of the Baskervilles!' Our first two months in London passed by in a flash. In that disconcerting courtroom experience we were first thrown into on the day we arrived in the country... ...and in Soseki-san's terrible ordeal that had followed closely behind, we had emerged victorious. However... ...there then came an abrupt end to our opportunities to appear in court. Which was hardly surprising, of course... ...since I was nothing more than an amateur, an unknown student of law from a faraway land. So life in our little office was very quiet. That is... ...until it was shattered one day, by that fateful telegram... 15th April, 9:13 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy *Knock knock knock* That morning... ...I was woken by the unreserved knocking on the door by the telegram boy. But after he'd gone... ...Susato-san's behaviour became very obviously strange. Ryunosuke: Um...Susato-san? Susato: Yes! Is it time to leave for court already? Let me see... What case is it today? Ryunosuke: I...don't think I'm scheduled to defend anyone at the moment, am I? Susato: Oh! No, of course not. How silly of me. Ryunosuke: But I think Iris said she would make us breakfast this morning. So shall we go down to Mr Sholmes's suite? Susato: Yes! Iris makes the most delicious breakfast food. Ryunosuke: She does, doesn't she? Susato: And once our bellies are full, we can leave for court in fighting fit form! Let me see... What case is it today? Ryunosuke: (Here we go again...) 15th April Sholmes's Suite Iris: Morning, Runo! Morning, Susie! Susato: Good morning, Iris! Ryunosuke: Um...Iris... Iris: What is it, Runo? Ryunosuke: What is that terrible noise? It sounds like a cat being strangled. Iris: Ah, yes... You noticed that, did you? Hurley isn't in the best form this morning, it seems. Sholmes: Hello... Susato: Hello...Mr Sholmes. Ryunosuke: G-Good morning. Sholmes: ......... A good morning to die perhaps... Ryunosuke: ...Has something happened, Mr Sholmes? You look miserable, and...the way you were playing the violin before... Sholmes: Hmph. My analytical mind is dead. Music is dead. The world...is dead. Damn this blanched existence! ...That's all it is, my dear fellow. Nothing of consequence. Susato: I'm afraid I don't understand. Sholmes: Well, Iris? Isn't it time we ate? Some dry toast and insipid coffee for me...if it's not too much trouble. ???: Miaow... Ryunosuke: Oh look, it's Wagahai. Susato: Good morning, boy. Wagahai: Miaow. Ryunosuke: ......... (That must be some sort of tiny door for cats to use. But how did it get there?) Iris: Well then, everyone, time for breakfast! Susato: Oh, wonderful! Let me help you, Iris. Sholmes: Ugh...it would indeed be a fine day to die... Ryunosuke: (Ah, I knew something looked different... Something's missing from Mr Sholmes's desk.) After clearing all Converse options with Herlock Sholmes and Iris Wilson: MIIIAAOWWW! Susato: Oh! What was that? Ryunosuke: Wagahai? *Clatter clatter* *Screeeeeech...* Susato: ......... Sholmes: What was that? Iris: Oh no! Wagahai's tangled up in your violin! Susato: I think he thinks it's a toy! Ryunosuke: No! (What's he doing to it?!) Susato: Oh dear... Mr Sholmes's precious violin... Sholes: ...Why should I care? Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: I shouldn't be surprised... ...if the cat is a more accomplished musician than I now. Susato: ...Mr Sholmes really is in poor spirits, isn't he? Iris: Well anyway, I'll put it back where it lives, shall I, Hurley? Ryunosuke: Out of the cat's reach, if possible. (Maybe we should assess the damage...) After examining \"violin\" and clearing all Converse options with Iris Wilson: Sholmes: Come, Mr Naruhodo! Dilly-dallying will get you nowhere! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: Crunching your toast with that vacant aspect... Fressing your coffee so obtusely... Are you not a little embarrassed by your own conduct, considering the urgency with which we are faced? Susato: We must visit Mr Windibank's brokery at once! That's right, isn't it, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Precisely, Miss Susato. Without a moment's delay! Ryunosuke: But, but I haven't finished my bacon and eggs... Sholmes: My dear fellow! Surely you do not still intend... ...to crunch your bacon with an increasingly vacant aspect? To fress your egg ever more obtusely? Ryunosuke: Alright, alright, say no more! Let's go then. Iris: Don't worry, Runo, I'd be happy to heat it up for you again later. Ryunosuke: Oh, thank you, Iris. (As it happens, I am rather curious to see what a British pawnbroker's looks like.) Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Baker Street 15th April Windibank's Pawnbrokery Ryunosuke: So this...is a British pawnbrokery... Susato: Oh my! There are all sorts of tools and contraptions in here that I've never laid eyes on before! Ryunosuke: (Ah, Susato-san...and that spark of wonder in your eyes. You can't wait to scour the shelves, can you?) I get the impression you enjoy places like this? Susato: Oh yes! I don't know why, but seeing such a lot of things I don't understand is a real thrill for me! Sholmes: My dear fellows...let us not forget why we are here. Susato: Oh! Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: We are calling on matters of business, not pleasure. Ryunosuke: (And clearly Mr Sholmes means business, too, judging from the spark of fury in HIS eyes.) Windibank: Ah, Mr Sholmes, sir! Welcome back! Sholmes: ...Did you hear that brazen welcome? Ryunosuke: Well, yes. We are potential customers, after all. Sholmes: We are disgruntled customers, Mr Naruhodo. And it's time to inform Mr Windibank of our ire. Come! The fight is afoot! After clearing all Converse options: Windibank: Now then, Mr Sholmes, allow me to return your precious violin. Sholmes: Ah, the very thing! Thank you, Mr Windibank. Windibank: Perhaps this might mark the end of the peculiar items you try to pop, hm? Because if anything were to happen to one of them... ...this would be the only answer! Ryunosuke: Um, I really think you ought to stop waving that gun around. Someone could get hurt. Windibank: Fear not! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Windibank: I've only loaded a single bullet, so no one but myself could possibly be harmed! Ryunosuke: (That's...not really what I meant.) Sholmes: Good day to you then, Mr Windibank. Windibank: It's been a pleasure as always, Mr Sholmes! Susato: So, Mr Naruhodo! Now we can explore at last! After examining brown machine on left, shelves, brown machine on right, machine in foreground, and calendar: ???: Wot?! Only tuppence for it? That ain't fair, and you know it! ???: That article is barely worth a penny, miss. I cannot offer more. Ryunosuke: (Sounds like there's an argument brewing over by the counter.) ???: Come on, that can't be right! 'Ave you even 'ad a proper butcher's at it? ???: I've seen all I need to see, young girl! Ryunosuke: Wait, don't we know...? (I'm sure I recognise her.) Susato: Oh! Yes! It's the young lady...from Mr McGilded's trial two months ago! McGilded: Her name is Gina Lestrade, My Lord. She's a chancer. Earns her crust among large crowds, relievin' people of their purses. What's commonly called a pickpocket. Gina: ......... Gordon Bennett! You lot! Susato: Hello, Miss Lestrade. I hope you've been well. Gina: Eh?! Wot, you remember me then, do ya? Ryunosuke: Well, I remember being completely surrounded by smoke, that's for sure. Gina: So...wot are you doin' in 'ere? Down and out, like the rest of us? Nuffin' to eat? Come to pop that black weasel - sorry, 'coat' - 'ave ya? Ryunosuke: (...What is it about this black uniform that makes everyone comment on it?) Sholmes: Ah, good day. Unless I'm much mistaken... ...you would be the young pickpocket who stole our experimental smoke grenade launcher. Gina: Agh! Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: So...you have something of value to pawn, do you? Allow me to see the article, and I shall negotiate with Mr Windibank on your behalf. Gina: Pull the other one! I don't need no 'elp from some stuck-up dee! Get outta my business! Go on, or I'll make trouble for ya! Sholmes: As you wish, Miss Lestrade. I will happily remove myself from your presence. Ryunosuke: (He's really done it. He's gone.) Windibank: I'm sorry, but as I said, there really is no room for negotiation here. Ryunosuke: (What is that thing he has in his hand? Some kind of metal disk?) Gina: And you! Go on! Leave me alone! Susato: Oh, Miss Lestrade, just pretend we aren't here. We shan't be offended in the slightest. Gina: ......... Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: (Susato-san can really stand her ground when she wants to.) Gina: Wotever... After clearing \"Gina Lestrade\" and \"New article to pawn\" Converse options with Pop Windibank: ???: Out of my way, please! Ryunosuke: (Who's this picture-postcard English gentleman?) ???: Good day to you, ladies. Gentlemen. Gina: Wot's your problem, eh? ???: There is no problem, as long as you remove yourself. I've a matter to discuss with the proprietor. Gina: ...! ???: And if you intend to make a problem of it, I shall see you outside, little girl, for the hiding you deserve. Gina: Look, ain't it obvious? I ain't done talkin' wiv 'im yet. If you think yer such a gent, you should know 'ow to wait in line. ???: ......... Well, you are an impudent little brat, aren't you? ...As well as a pickpocket. Gina: Eh? Who, who are you? 'Ow d'you know who I am? ???: The question is, how do YOU not know who I am? You haven't the courtesy even to remember the faces of your victims, it seems. Gina: ...! Wot?! You mean I...? From you...? ???: Broker! Windibank: Um, yes, sir? ???: I believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemd an article from you, no? Windibank: Yes, yes, erm... ???: The article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once. Susato: Oh my! Gina: Now that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull? ???: Give me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box disks, too. Gina: No! You, you can't 'ave it! You just can't! It's me old man's! Or it was! ...Now it's mine! Susato: Goodness, Mr Naruhodo... ...this is a very awkward situation. Ryunosuke: Yes... I think perhaps we should hear both sides of the story in a little more detail. After clearing all Converse options with Gina Lestrade and \"Eggert Benedict\": Windibank: So, let that be an end to the matter. And thank you for your custom, Mr Eggert Benedict, sir. Benedict: With such reasonable rates of interest...I may even decide to come back. Gina: ......... Tsk! This is why I 'ate grown-ups! Just cos I'm a diver, everyone thinks that makes me a liar. Benedict: And the contents of the coat pockets, if you please, broker. Windibank: But of course, sir. Here is the disk for you. Benedict: ......... Just this one? Windibank: Pardon, sir? Benedict: I was expecting another. Er, that is...I deposited another. Ryunosuke: (Another disk?) Windibank: Oh, um... Oh dear. I regret to inform you, sir, that what was deposited with me was merely the overcoat. The disk happened to be in one of the pockets, but I was completely unaware of it until now. Benedict: So, gutterling... You're hiding more of what's rightfully mine, are you? Gina: Says who, eh? I don't know nuffin' about it! Benedict: ......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style. Gina: Wait a minute! That disk... ...is mine! Benedict: Argh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal! Susato: Oh my! Yes! There's blood on the disk! Ryunosuke: (It's because of all those sharp little bumps! The man must have scratched his finger on them.) Gina: I found it first, alright! I mean! It belonged to me old man! So yer not 'avin' it! ...Oi, you! You take it! Ryunosuke: Me? Gina: If I 'ang onto it, they'll 'ave it off me again. So you keep 'old of it. Ryunosuke: Miss Lestrade, I... (Why is this disk so important to her?) The music box disc has been entered into the Court Record. Benedict: You there! In the black livery! Hand that disk to me at once, please. Gina: No! Don't! He's lyin'! Grown-ups are all liars! Ryunosuke: (Ugh... What do I do now? How am I going to resolve this?) Ryunosuke: Erm...Mr Sholmes... ...what are you examining with such keen interest there? As you enjoy a bar of caramel, I see. Sholmes: ......... So... ...you've found me at last...Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: After that young pickpocket sent me on my way, I was forced to lurk in the shadows. Cruelly ostracised, as the rest of you partook in the jovial atmosphere of fellowship. I had nothing to occupy my mind, but was too ashamed to let society see what my downfall had done to me. So feigning mock interest, I pretended to examine the tedious trinkets in this desolate place. ...Whilst, as you shrewdly observed, gnawing on the only friend I have left: this seven per cent solution of caramel. Pray, do you claim to understand the depths of my despair, Mr Naruhodo? But how could you?! I was so lonely... So desperately lonely... Ryunosuke: Then...why on earth didn't you rejoin the conversation? Things have gone from bad to worse here, you know! Sholmes: Yes...I overheard much of your conversation. Or rather...in my craving for human contact, my ears devoured every word that was uttered! Ryunosuke: ...You really were sad, weren't you? Susato: Poor Mr Sholmes. I feel simply awful for you. Sholmes: It would seem... ...that my inferences are correct. Susato: Oh! ...Surely you're not about to tell us... ...that you've solved the entire case once again?! Sholmes: My dear madam, sometimes I wonder... Were my genius for deduction to be commoditised... ...how much could I pawn it for? Ryunosuke: (It seems Mr Sholmes has had another of his flashes of inspiration. But who knows if it will help to resolve the situation between Miss Lestrade and the mysterious gentleman? What's the right thing to do here...?) Sholmes: Well, Miss Lestrade...it would appear you find yourself in something of a predicament. Gina: Tsk! Where the blue blazes 'ave you been, eh? Sholmes: Pardon? Gina: When a lady's in trouble, a true gent's s'posed to be there to 'elp. Straight away! Not an 'our later! Ryunosuke: (...Harsh.) Benedict: And who, pray tell, are you? Sholmes: ......... Mr Eggert Benedict... ...you have, in my eyes, a veritably encyclopaedic array of curiosities about your person. Nevertheless, there are two immovable conclusions I have drawn. Benedict: I beg your pardon? Sholmes: The first is this: The true reason for your visit to this pawnbrokery today is something you have not yet revealed. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: And the second is this: A considerable crime is in contemplation. One you will orchestrate, with intent to steal a vast sum of money. Well, Mr Benedict? What say you to my deductions? Benedict: How...! Ryunosuke: (He's turned as white as a hard-boiled egg!) Susato: It would seem that once again...Mr Sholmes has made a flawless deduction! Benedict: Just who do you think you are, sir? Sholmes: Ah yes, as I hoped... That is precisely the pained expression I was looking for. So...shall we begin? The time has come for yet another Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! The Great DeductionThe game is afoot! Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Sholmes: First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! The piece of paper in your hand is a 'staff wanted' advertisement from this very shop. Yet even the most unobservant would soon realise that a man of your appearance has no need of such employ. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction. Benedict: What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years! Sholmes: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. The end of any walking cane would be terminated with a metal ferrule to protect the wooden tip. And yet detailed analysis shows the wooden tip of this stick to be utterly bare. Therefore...there is only one conclusion: The rod that you hold in your hand, which appears to be a walking cane... ...is in fact no cane at all! Benedict: ...! Sholmes: You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong? Benedict: I... Well, I... Sholmes: And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear? Benedict: ......... Sholmes: Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. From the moment I saw it, my suspicions were aroused. 'What walking cane demands such a stout handle?' mused I. Benedict: ......... Sholmes: But of course, as I said, this is no walking cane. No, that rod... ...is the broken handle of a shovel! Benedict: Wha...? Are you insane?! Sholmes: And now, having determined this undeniable truth, the conclusion is clear. Your true motive for coming here... ...was to take employment at this establishment in order to excavate the ground beneath the premises! What a calculated crime you have conceived, sir. A wickedly calculated crime. Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery Topic 2 Great Crime Sholmes: Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning. Benedict: This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, intend to excavate the ground beneath this pawnbrokery with a broken shovel? What on earth do you propose I could expect to find there? Some long-forgotten treasure, I suppose? Save for such a fanciful theory, what possible reason could I have to do as you say? Sholmes: Oh, but there is ample reason... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped. Benedict: What? Sholmes: Let us consider what would motivate a man to infiltrate a shop such as this and covertly dig beneath its floor... The answer is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. This letter gives notice of public works to be carried out in the local area. And according to the enclosed plan of the upcoming sewerage works... ...beneath this shop runs a sewer that adjoins another, one that runs under the bank on the opposite side of the road. Benedict: This madness has entered the sewers now, has it?! Sholmes: By excavating the ground beneath our feet, you would gain access to the waterway... ...that flows in very close proximity to the great vault of the financial institution opposite. Benedict: What are you...? Sholmes: In summary, sir... ...you devised a master plan to pull off an elaborate bank robbery by dint of the underground tunnels! Benedict: M... Master plan?! Sholmes: Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... With what plunder did the thief hope to make off from the underground vault of the bank? Benedict: Are you quite serious? Sholmes: Having consulted with Scotland Yard some days ago, I happen to know the answer. But naturally, the answer is no secret to you, is it, Mr Benedict? Benedict: I have no idea what you're talking about! Sholmes: Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know. Benedict: A postcard of the Great Exhibition? I'm afraid you've quite lost me. Sholmes: Currently in the final stages of preparation, the Great Exhibition will soon be underway. And the government has provided extra funds to complete its centrepiece, the Crystal Tower. Funds that currently sit in the vault of the bank on the other side of this road! Benedict: Pardon? Sholmes: Yes, the considerable crime you have been contemplating... ...is the theft of that which sits in the vault of that bank, the special reserve funds for the Great Exhibition! ...Of course, that is top-secret police information. So keep it under your hat, please. Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this pawnbroking puzzle! Ryunosuke: Um...Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: Well, Mr Naruhodo? An impressively upbeat deduction for a detective racked with loneliness, would you not agree? Ryunosuke: Was it true what you said about the bank over the road and what it has in its vault? Sholmes: Indeed. Though few know of its existence. It is one of the government's most closely guarded secrets. Gregson told me, in the strictest confidence. Susato: But you just announced it to everyone here. Rather loudly, in fact. Sholmes: ...Ah. Ryunosuke: And if it's such a big secret... ...how would Mr Benedict have come to find out about it? Sholmes: There can be but one explanation for that. Clearly it is because the man is a criminal! Susato: But what if he didn't know anything about the money in the vault? If he is a criminal, as you said... ...then buying a brand new shovel is sure to be the first thing he does now that you've revealed the secret. Sholmes: ...Oh. Ryunosuke: Or if he doesn't... ...maybe Mr Windibank will. He already has plenty of shovels here, after all. Windibank: Oh my life! I assure you I'm not so unscrupulous! Sholmes: Hm, well... Hopefully this has taught you a valuable lesson. Sensitive information must be handled with the utmost of care. One can never be sure that someone privy to secrets won't disclose them. And once the word is out, it's out. Ryunosuke: ...Perhaps I'll think twice before confiding in you next time, Mr Sholmes. Sholmes: An excellent idea, Mr Naruhodo. An excellent idea. Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Susato: Well then, Mr Naruhodo, you know what to do, I'm sure. Ryunosuke: Yes. Let's listen to that great deduction again, and see if we can massage it into shape! Sholmes: Very well, then. Let us start once more from the beginning... ...of Herlock Sholmes's magnificent 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! Course CorrectionHold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery Sholmes: First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! Ryunosuke: So, by Mr Sholmes's reasoning... ...Mr Benedict came here in order to apply for a job so he could dig down through the floor. Susato: Yes. In an attempt to tunnel into the sewers to gain access to the money in the vault of the bank across the road. But...he wouldn't get very far with a broken shovel, would he? Ryunosuke: No. I think it's fair to say his motives lie elsewhere. The question is, where? What did bring Mr Benedict here at this particular point in time? Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! Susato: I still don't quite understand why this gentleman came to Mr Windibank's today. Ryunosuke: He might look like a smartly dressed man about town, but perhaps he's destitute really. I really think that's the only explanation! Susato: We must stop thinking along those lines, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Yes...I suppose you're right. Well in that case... ...perhaps there's something in this pawn shop that the man was looking for? Susato: Let's look closely and see if there's anything about his person that gives us a clue. Ryunosuke: Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the info about Miss Lestrade! Sholmes: Quite so, my dear fellow! It would appear that the writing and sketch on the reverse of the flyer... ...pertain to the pickpocket, Miss Lestrade, and to Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery here. Benedict: Ah! Ryunosuke: You originally told us... ...that you had merely given chase after Miss Lestrade stole the redemption ticket from you. Sholmes: But that, sir, is a thinly veiled lie. Ryunosuke: It is the information on the back of the flyer that led you here today. By which I mean... Here, to Windibank's Pawnbrokery, and today, the redemption deadline of that overcoat. Sholmes: So you waited outside for the young girl matching the description you have written down to arrive. Benedict: Hmph! Sholmes: And you have gone to some lengths to hide the reason for your pursuit of Miss Lestrade. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction. Benedict: What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years! Sholmes: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. Ryunosuke: Um...what's a ferrule? Susato: It's the metal cap commonly found on the end of a cane, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Ah, the bit that makes the nice clacking sound on the pavement? Susato: Yes, exactly, And Mr Sholmes is right, it appears to be missing on this cane. Ryunosuke: ...But it doesn't actually look broken, does it? Susato: No, it doesn't. Though the gentleman certainly did recoil when Mr Sholmes identified the cane as suspicious. Ryunosuke: In other words... ...there's some secret about the cane that Mr Benedict would rather we don't know! The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. Ryunosuke: I don't know, I just can't picture it. I mean, a respectable gentleman strolling the streets of London with a shovel in his hand? (I'm sure it's just that the cane is broken and the ferrule was lost somehow.) Susato: Well, there is one thing of which we can be certain in all of this. After all, we saw it with our own eyes. At the mention of his cane, Mr Benedict visibly recoiled. Ryunosuke: ...! (That's very true. So there's definitely something about this cane that's not right...) Ryunosuke: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the initialling. Sholmes: A most astute observation...wouldn't you say, Mr Eggert Benedict? Benedict: ...! Sholmes: We are led to believe, sir, that your initials are 'E. B.'. Yet in a most possessive manner, you have in your grasp a cane bearing the initials 'A. G.'. An incontrovertible contradiction indeed, would you not agree? Benedict: No! You're, you're wrong. This cane isn't- Ryunosuke: You said before that you'd had that cane for years. Benedict: Grrr... Ryunosuke: So don't try to tell us that you just borrowed it from a friend or found it in the park! Sholmes: In short... ...though you hold yourself to be a gentleman, you have withheld your true name! Benedict: ...! Sholmes: You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong? Benedict: I... Well, I... Sholmes: And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear? Benedict: ......... Sholmes: Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Ryunosuke: Let's consider the bare bones of what's happened here: Miss Lestrade redeemed that fine-looking overcoat. And now a mysterious man has appeared, introducing himself with a fake name... ...and claiming that the overcoat belongs to him. Susato: But we know that he actually identified Miss Lestrade from a written description. Which suggests that everything else he's told us is untrue. Ryunosuke: So what we need to do here... ...is somehow prove that the overcoat cannot possibly belong to him! The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Ryunosuke: The man is white all over, but for his overcoat. That's almost reason enough to say it doesn't belong to him, isn't it? Susato: But I'm sure the gentleman's wardrobe isn't exclusively white, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Well mine is exclusively black! Susato: ...I think perhaps we should go shopping together. Ryunosuke: (There's no doubt about it. That black overcoat doesn't suit Mr Benedict at all. But we need a more tangible way of proving it...) Ryunosuke: The split seam, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Benedict: Ah! Sholmes: Yes, because the overcoat is rather obviously a poor fit. Ryunosuke: Having forced it over your broad shoulders, the seam is already breaking apart. Sholmes: My suspicions were aroused from the outset... ...when you so baldly lied about your name and so boldly waylaid this pickpocket. Benedict: Argh! Sholmes: This catalogue of untruths has all been for one very specific purpose: To steal the article that the young girl redeemed from Mr Windibank! Benedict: AAAAAARGH!!! Sholmes: But what really irks me is this: The considerable crime I initially imagined has been considerably curtailed. Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery To abscond with a redeemed item Solved Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds Sholmes: Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning. Benedict: This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, designed a wheeze to filch some tawdry article of pawnage? Have you forgotten that I redeemed the article in the proper manner, using the watchword? Had I not been the one to deposit it in the first place... ...how could I possibly have known the relevant details? N'est-ce pas? Sholmes: Oh, but the watchword can be discovered... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped. Benedict: What? Sholmes: Let us consider how one might come to learn a secret watchword relating to the pawned property of another... The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Susato: The direction of the deduction must change rather dramatically now, I think. Ryunosuke: Yes, no more talk of tunnelling into the sewers. (Which is a pity, because it all sounded rather exciting.) Anyway... ...you can't deny that this mysterious gentleman did know the watchword. Susato: Yes. 'Professor'... If you didn't know that word, Mr Windibank would never allow you to redeem the article. Ryunosuke: Or, looking at it another way... ...if you did know that word, Mr Windibank would allow you to redeem the article whether it was yours or not. (So the question is, could this gentleman have found the watchword out somehow?) The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Ryunosuke: There's no question that Mr Benedict used some wheeze or other to find out the watchword. (Let's think. He only appeared in the shop after Miss Lestrade had redeemed the overcoat...) Susato: He certainly couldn't have overheard Miss Lestrade saying the watchword. So he can only have discovered it from something on this countertop. Ryunosuke: (It sounds like I need to have another look and examine things more closely this time.) Ryunosuke: The method is revealed by the notelet on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Sholmes: Yes, the broker here follows the same procedure whenever a customer comes to redeem an article. He asks the customer for the watchword, and notes down the response uttered on a notelet he has to hand. Then he consults his ledger, and confirms whether or not the watchword matches that of the article in question. Benedict: I would expect nothing less of a diligent pawnbroker. Ryunosuke: But his diligence clearly has its disadvantages. Benedict: What are you talking about? Sholmes: It is increasingly apparent that you were present in this shop before your accusation against Miss Lestrade. Ryunosuke: In all likelihood, you followed her inside, and then observed her talking to Mr Windibank. Sholmes: When the diligent broker made a note of the watchword, as is his common practice... Ryunosuke: ...You observed him writing the word 'Professor' on the notelet beside the ledger. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: And that, sir... ...was the master plan you devised to steal the pawned article from the young Miss Lestrade! Benedict: M... Master plan?! Sholmes: Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... Why would you go to such lengths to redeem that particular article from this pawnbroker? Benedict: Are you quite serious? Sholmes: For an ill-fitting overcoat hardly seems to justify the effort, much less a worthless music box disk. But naturally, you had very good reason to make them yours, didn't you, Mr Benedict? Benedict: I have no idea what you're talking about! Sholmes: Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know. Ryunosuke: The articles we're talking about are the overcoat and the music box disk that was in one of the pockets. Susato: Which according to Mr Windibank, isn't even worth a penny. Ryunosuke: And yet this man went to such lengths to steal them... Why? Susato: I wonder if perhaps... ...we already have the evidence we need to explain it, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: (Could we? Really? I'd better have a thorough look through all the evidence we've collected so far.) Ryunosuke: You see, this music box disk tells us all we need to know. Benedict: What's that...on the back...? Sholmes: It reads, 'For McGilded'... Benedict: Agh! Sholmes: Ah, Mr Magnus McGilded... The unfortunate philanthropist who perished in curious circumstances at the Old Bailey two months ago. A prominent man in London...though his loan-mongering demonstrated a distinct lack of scruples. So...you're an associate of his, are you? Or perhaps a subordinate? Benedict: ......... Ryunosuke: Mr McGilded was a man of unusually small stature. In fact... ...he was precisely the right size for that overcoat that you've squeezed yourself into. Benedict: Ugh! Sholmes: Your true identity remains shrouded in mystery... Mr Eggert Benedict. But the final conclusion here is crystal clear. The reason you came to this pawnbrokery today... ...was to retrieve an article left behind by the late Magnus McGilded! Benedict: Tsk... AAAAAAAAARGH!!! Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds To acquire an item deposited by Mr McGilded Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Sholmes: Well well, Mr Magnus McGilded... Not a name I expected to hear in these circumstances. Benedict: ......... Susato: Mr Sholmes, I'm afraid there's something very troubling on my mind. Sholmes: Pray tell, Miss Susato. Susato: Well, according to what Mr Windibank told us earlier... ...today was the final day on which the coat could have been redeemed, was it not? Windibank: Yes, ma'am, that is correct. Today would be precisely two months since it was first deposited. Ryunosuke: Well, today is 15th April, so...two months ago today... Windibank: ...Would have been 15th February, sir, that's right. It's all carefully recorded in my ledger. Deposited at 10:30 p.m., I see. Ryunosuke: What?! But, but that suggests... Susato: Yes. 15th February... Ryunosuke: ...Is precisely the day on which the omnibus murder took place! Susato: And half past ten in the evening... ...is precisely the time at which the terrible events were unfolding! Sholmes: Suggestive is not the word. It would seem the matter is entirely beyond coincidence. Benedict: ......... You are of course at liberty to make whatever outlandish deductions you choose. However... ...I must insist you hand over the music box disk now. Ryunosuke: ...! Benedict: It would be a terrible shame to return to your native land in a box. Ryunosuke: Agh... (What do I do?!) Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank! Windibank: This is my shop! I can't allow any harm to come to my customers! If that were to happen... ...I should have to take my own life! Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank, no! ???: Alright, that's enough! Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson! Benedict: Inspector...? Gregson: That's right, sunshine. The alarm was raised on one of our dedicated emergency lines. So we got here as fast as we could. Now, what's this all about, eh? Windibank: Oh, praise be! You're here at last! I was moments away from forfeiting my own life in my very own establishment! Benedict: ......... It would seem you have the upper hand. Gregson: Right, you lot have got some explainin' to do! I don't appreciate bein' bothered with some petty argy-bargy! Susato: Petty?! Mr Windibank very nearly met with his end! Gregson: Yeah, with his own gun, as far as I can tell. Windibank: Oh dear... Gregson: And the whole of Britain could meet with its end if I don't get to the bottom of the case I'm s'posed to be workin' on! Ryunosuke: What?! What on earth is the case, Inspector? Sholmes: Spare no detail, Gregson! Gregson: ...I, I might have said a little too much. No matter. It's nothin' to do with you lot. Anyway, sir, you're gonna have to come with me down to the station. Benedict: ......... But of course, Inspector... Gregson: Aah! He's getting away! Get after him, lads! Whistle the beat officer, too!Sir! Gregson: ...There's been a spate of thefts at pawn shops round here recently. So we've fitted emergency buttons underneath the counters for brokers to let us know when there's trouble. Windibank: Oh, Inspector...I was very worried there for a while. Very worried indeed. Gregson: Now then, Mr Permanently-in-Mournin'... Ryunosuke: Oh! ...Yes? Gregson: I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over! Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, of course... Gina: No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine! Gregson: I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now. Ryunosuke: As evidence...? Sholmes: If the police demand something as evidence, my dear fellow, we have no choice but to capitulate. It's all yours, Inspector. Gina: Grrr... Ryunosuke: And so, we handed Mr McGilded's disk over to Inspector Gregson... ...and were summarily turfed out of the shop and onto the street. To be continued... Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy (before initiating Logic and Reasoning Spectacular) 15th April Baker Street Gina: See? That's why I 'ate grown-ups. All they do is feed you a pack o' lies and take stuff away from ya! Sholmes: Oh really, Miss Lestrade? ...Tell me, is that overcoat keeping you warm? Gina: Wot? Susato: Oh my! Surely, you were given that! Gina: Yeah, the dee let me keep it. After I looked daggers at 'im for long enough. 'E went through the pockets and then said, 'Go on, then, 'ave it' before tellin' me to scarper. Always pays off, givin' people a look like you 'ate 'em. Ryunosuke: I can't help feeling that it's going to get you into serious trouble one day... Gina: Wot I really wanted was that nice, shiny disk, mind. Susato: The music box disk? Ryunosuke: But Mr Windibank said it was practically worthless. Gina: I think I'm gonna go and 'ave another bash. Give 'em a long, 'ard stare. Sholmes: I think not, Miss Lestrade. We shan't enter Windibank's again today. Gina: Why not?! That's not fair! Ryunosuke: It can't be helped, I'm afraid. The police are investigating the scene now, and taking a statement from Mr Windibank. Gina: But that disk's mine! I 'ad the ticket for this coat, and it was in this coat's pocket! And there should be somefin' else an' all! That's wot that rotten cove said, ain't it? Ryunosuke: Yes, he did mention something about another article, didn't he? Gina: Well then, that's mine, too! Wotever it is! Ryunosuke: (Now she's really pushing her luck...) Sholmes: Miss Lestrade, I think it's time to admit defeat. You've had your 'haul' for the day. Gina: Yeah! And it's all your fault, Sholmes! Sholmes: So what are your plans now? Will you dine with us this evening? Gina: Eh? Sholmes: Iris would be delighted to cook, I'm sure. And I might entertain you with a modest violin recital. Gina: ......... No, ta. Sholmes: Oh... Gina: Why would I come round your place, eh? 'Ave you lost your 'ead or somefin'?! Susato: Oh dear. She's gone. Sholmes: Hm, having reviled on me quite unnecessarily, I might add. Ryunosuke: I...can't help wondering... ...if perhaps she might turn up anyway. Sholmes: Interesting... Ryunosuke: Once she's had a chance to calm down, I think there's a good chance she'll decide to come. Sholmes: ......... Very well, then. I'll inform Iris to set a place for our potential guest at the dinner table this evening. And one more thing... I should be glad of your company later, too. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: I believe I will have a rather splendid surprise to show you. Susato: Oh, how exciting! What is it? Sholmes: You shall have to wait and see, Miss Susato. ...Until later, then! 15th April, 3:46 p.m. Sholmes's Suite Iris: Ah, Susie! And Runo! Come in, come in! Ryunosuke: Good afternoon, Iris. Susato: Thank you so much for breakfast this morning. Iris: Oh, don't mention it! ...Goodness! Look at the time already! Ryunosuke: Busy as always? Iris: I am! I'm preparing everything for dinner this evening. Ryunosuke: Already? You're obviously cooking something special, are you? Iris: Oh, yes! After all, we have a special guest joining us! Guess who it is! Go on! Hee hee, you'll never guess! Ryunosuke: Um... (Look at those little eyes of hers shining!) Susato: Oh dear. It is awkward when you already know the answer, isn't it? Iris: It's Ginny! Isn't that exciting?! Susato: Oh! Oh...what a surprise! Yes, that's wonderful news! Ryunosuke: (Wow, Iris seems overjoyed at the idea!) Iris: I can't wait to learn some pickpocketing tips from a real professional! Ryunosuke: Oh yes! That does sound like fun! Susato: I'm not sure that's entirely appropriate. Are you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Erm... By the way, Iris, what's Mr Sholmes up to? Iris: Hurley? Oh, he's been like that ever since he got back. Ryunosuke: ...Hellooo! Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: I beg that you won't speak to me. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: I don't know who you are, but kindly take your leave. As you can see, I'm not here. Ryunosuke: ......... (I, I don't know how to respond to that.) Iris: I do apologise. When he gets like this, he's completely oblivious to everything. Ryunosuke: Yes... I see... Iris: Really, he behaves just like a child sometimes, Hurley does. Susato: Mr Sholmes and Iris have something of a parent-and-child relationship, don't they? Ryunosuke: Yes, except that Iris is clearly the parent here... (Come to think of it... ...I wonder where her real parents are.) Iris: What's the matter, Runo? You have ever such a funny look on your face! Ryunosuke: Oh...no...it's nothing. Iris: I know what it is! 'Why does this girl live here with Mr Sholmes?' you're wondering. ...Am I right? Ryunosuke: How?! How did you...? Iris: Heh heh, oh, Runo! I can read you like a book! Ryunosuke: (Ugh... This girl is dangerous...) Iris: Don't worry, you can ask me anything! I won't mind. After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Ah, my dear fellows! How good to see you! Susato: Eek! Mr, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Whyever did you not make your presence known to me before? Ryunosuke: ...Haah. Sholmes: Well, no matter now. So, how the devil are you? Ryunosuke: We've...been with you for most of the day. Sholmes: Goodness, really? Susato: Do tell me, Mr Sholmes, is your violin unscathed? Sholmes: Hm? My violin? Whatever are you talking about, dear madam? Susato: Oh! Um... Sholmes: Never mind that now. I have something far more interesting to show you. Behold, my dear fellows! Susato: Oh, another music box disk. Sholmes: No, not 'another' disk, Miss Susato. This is the one Gregson demanded we hand over as evidence: Mr McGilded's disk! Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: Then, then...what's it doing here?! Sholmes: Heh heh heh! You know, at times, Mr Naruhodo... ...I think that though I have an undeniable turn for detection... ...I may well be even more adept at larceny! Iris: Ooh! That would be wonderfully exciting! I'd be your pickpocketing assistant! And Runo could be our go-to lawyer if we ever got caught! Ryunosuke: Right... Iris: Plus, Susie has such beautiful handwriting, she could write all our menacing crime notifications! Susato: Yes! I'd be delighted! Ryunosuke: (I'm just going to pretend this conversation never happened, I think.) After clearing all Converse options: Iris: Well, it's time I started getting things ready for dinner, I think. Ginny will be here before long. Sholmes: Thank you, Iris. Susato: Oh, well you must let me help you, then. Iris: Of course, Susie! There's plenty to do. Sholmes: I think I shall investigate the condition of my faithful performing partner. Now then...where did I leave it...? Ryunosuke: Let this be a lesson to you, Mr Sholmes: Never leave anything too precious with the pawnbroker. Sholmes: Hm, yes... You may be right. Susato: Oh, that reminds me! Of something Mr Windibank said before. He said that he had a manuscript of Iris's in pawn, didn't he? Sholmes: Did he? Ryunosuke: Yes, he definitely mentioned it. 'Mr Sholmes's latest tale of otherworldly mystery lies dormant in my storeroom,' were his words, I believe. Iris: So you heard about that, did you? I expect you were as incensed as I was! Susato: Oh yes! The idea of such a wonderful story languishing in Mr Windibank's storeroom, gathering dust... Sholmes: My dear madam, I'm quite sure I told you already... ...the pawnbroker's storeroom is the safest place for it. More secure than a bank's vault! Iris: And what about your Stradivarius, Hurley? Was that safe and secure? Sholmes: Weeell... There may be the occasional mix-up. Ryunosuke: (Caused by a certain impetuous someone not too far from me now...) Iris: Do you have any idea how long it took me to write that Baskerville story, Hurley? Susato: Oh, it sounds so exciting! 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'! I should love to read it! Iris: ......... Sholmes: ......... Susato: .........Ah! Ryunosuke: ......... (What's going on here? Why does it feel like an icy chill just swept through the room?) Iris: Susie...what did you just say? Susato: Erm... Iris: You said...'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... But...how could you know the full title? Susato: Well, that's... ......... Ryunosuke: That's because Miss Susato is such a great fan of all the stories about Mr Sholmes, of course. Iris: But Runo, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... ...has never been published. Ryunosuke: What? Iris: When I showed Hurley the manuscript, he told me that I wasn't allowed to publish it yet. Ryunosuke: I don't understand... Iris: That's why he said that he'd keep it safe. Until it was the right time for the story to be made public, you see. Ryunosuke: So that's why the manuscript is at Windibank's...? Iris: And yet, how could Susie here know its title? Well Hurley? What's going on? Sholmes: ......... ...Ah! Ryunosuke: ...? What is it, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: It would appear our guest has arrived. Ryunosuke: Miss Lestrade! Gina: ......... ...This was a bad idea. I knew I weren't welcome. I'm goin'! Ryunosuke: No! Wait! ...Miss Lestrade! We've all been eagerly awaiting your arrival. ...Haven't we, Iris? Iris: ......... Oh yes! Just wait there, Ginny. We'll have everything ready in a jiffy! Come along, Susie! Susato: Right! Of course! It's a pleasure to see you here, Miss Lestrade. Please, make yourself at home! Sholmes: Don't stand in the doorway, my dear girl. Come along in! What say you to some Mendelssohn? I won't take 'no' for an answer! Ryunosuke: ...Meddlesome it is, then. Gina: ......... Wagahai: ...Miaow. Ryunosuke: That evening... ...Iris prepared us all a meal that was even more delicious than usual... ...Mr Sholmes's violin performance was in no way meddlesome... ...and Gina, as we came to call her, taught us all how to steal things from one another without being noticed. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves...well into the night. 15th April, 9:34 p.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Ryunosuke: That was a very enjoyable evening, wasn't it? Susato: Oh yes! Iris's cooking was truly divine! Ryunosuke: And I feel as though I can still hear the enchanting strains of Mr Sholmes's violin even now. Susato: Best of all...I bet I could steal the glasses from His Lordship's face next time we're in court! ......... Naruhodo-san...could I consult with you about something, I wonder? Ryunosuke: What's the matter, Susato-san? Susato: ......... It's...about the telegram I received. Ryunosuke: Ah... (The one that arrived first thing this morning, I suppose.) Susato: ......... I've...I've been summoned. Ryunosuke: What?! Summoned? ...What do you mean? Susato: The telegram was from the Lord Chief Justice's office. Lord Stronghart has asked to see me. Ryunosuke: The Lord Chief Justice? ...When? Susato: Tomorrow morning. Ryunosuke: What?! Then, then we have to start preparing at once! Susato: Oh! No...that won't be necessary, Naruhodo-san. I've been summoned alone. Ryunosuke: Alone? What on earth for? Susato: ......... I have no idea. I suppose I shall find out tomorrow. Ryunosuke: (What's all this about? Whatever it is, it's making me feel very uneasy...) *Knock knock* Ryunosuke: (Oh, who could that be, I wonder?) Iris: Good evening, friends! Ryunosuke: Ah, Iris. Hello again. Gina: ......... Susato: And Gina, too. Iris: Yes! Ginny's going to stay with us tonight. She's going to sleep in with me! ...Isn't that right, Ginny? Gina: Well...yeah... Susato: How lovely! Let me make a pot of tea. Iris: You know, I've learnt so much today! Susato: Oh, what...in particular? Iris: All those things Ginny showed us! Wasn't it wonderful? Ryunosuke: Ah, you mean all those pickpocketing techniques? We had fun trying them out on each other, didn't we? Iris: I think I've awakened a natural talent! I could earn a living from it! Ryunosuke: (...You might be getting ahead of yourself a little there.) So...what brings you up to our humble quarters at this late hour? Iris: Well, you see... ...I came to return this. Ryunosuke: Wait, what?! That's, that's mine! Susato: Oh my! However did you...? Iris: I told you, didn't I? I have a natural talent for it! Ryunosuke: (Oh yes, I'd forgotten... ...Iris literally is a child genius.) Iris: So anyway, here...you can have it back. Not that I really understand why you wear it, though. Ryunosuke: Ah. Thank you. Iris: Alright then, good night! Ryunosuke: Yes, good night. Iris: ......... Hm... So this is your office, is it? What do you think, Ginny? Gina: I think I wouldn't fancy me chances wiv a lawyer wot lives in a place like this. Iris: Yes! Me too! Hahahaha! Ryunosuke: (It seems as though Iris here... ...still has something she'd like to talk about.) Susato: I suppose...she probably wants to talk about the manuscript. Ryunosuke: (Yes, I suppose she probably does.) After clearing all Converse options with Iris Wilson and Gina Lestrade: Iris: Oh my goodness! Look at the time! Come along, Ginny, we should go back downstairs. Gina: Yeah...alright. Iris: And please, don't mention any of this to Hurley, will you? Ryunosuke: No...of course not. Good night then, Iris. Good night, Gina. Susato: You must let me make breakfast for you tomorrow morning! I insist! Iris: Oh, yes please! I can't wait, Susie! Good night, then! Ryunosuke: (Iris... It sure is easy to forget, isn't it? Sometimes she speaks just like an adult. But deep down, she's still just a child.) Susato: Well, I think it's time that I turned in for the night, too, Naruhodo-san. Ryunosuke: Dr John H. Wilson... Iris's father... But also... ...the name of the murdered visiting professor at Yumei University. It can't be a mere coincidence... There's something deeper going on... ........................... .................. ......... ???: ...ster Naruhodo... ...Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: (That voice... That's...Mr Sholmes!) What's going on? It's the middle of the night. Sholmes: It's Miss Lestrade... She's gone. Ryunosuke: Gina? Sholmes: She was supposed to be sleeping in Iris's room. But her bed is empty. Ryunosuke: Well...she's an independent young woman. She probably decided to go home, no? Sholmes: I think not. From speaking to her before she retired... ...I received the distinct impression that she was looking forward to breakfasting with Miss Susato. No, I don't believe the girl has gone home. But I've been waiting for over an hour now. Ryunosuke: Over an hour? Oh... Sholmes: If you'll indulge me, look out of the window, my dear fellow. Ryunosuke: (What's this about?) ...! Wait a minute... (Why is there a light on at this time of night?) Sholmes: That's Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery. Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank's... (Oh no!) Gina: It's simple! If that story was really in old Windibank's storeroom... ...there's no way someone from 'alf way around the world - in other words, you - could know about it. Gina: Sorry, Iris, but if you ask me, 'e's sold it. Wivout tellin' you. Ryunosuke: (Could Gina have gone...?) Sholmes: It seems you have some knowledge of the situation, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? ...Oh, no! No, not really. Sholmes: Well anyway, we must investigate. ???: At once! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! 16th April, 1:14 a.m. Baker Street Ryunosuke: The door to Windibank's... It's open! Susato: And the lamp is burning. Ryunosuke: It must be Gina...mustn't it? Sholmes: Let us hope it's nothing more sinister. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: Come, there's not a moment to lose! Clearly something is afoot inside! Ryunosuke: ...There's no one here... Sholmes: ...Oh yes... ...there is! *BANG!* Susato: AAAAAAAH!!! Mr Sholmes! Mr Shooolmes!!! Ryunosuke: What the- (Has Sholmes been shot?!) Sholmes: Leave me, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: But... Sholmes: After them! Go! Ryunosuke: Right! Ryunosuke: ...Blast! (I've lost them!) ???: 'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere? Bobby: The alarm was just raised from this pawnbroker's sir. Would you know somethin' about that? Ryunosuke: Officer! Come with me! It's my friend! Mr Sholmes! He's been shot! Bobby: Shot?! Ryunosuke: With the policeman close behind me, I ran back to Windibank's... Anime cutscene Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! Susato: Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: How bad is it? Sholmes: Agh...never mind me. But there's much at stake. Behind that door... In the storeroom! ...Hurry! Ryunosuke: Huh?! It's...it's Gina?! To be continued... *BANG!* AAAAAAAH!!! I'll be alright, Mr Naruhodo! After them! Go! Behind that door. In the storeroom! ...Hurry! It's...it's Gina?! From that moment, Windibank's Pawnbrokery became a crime scene. Everything that followed happened in a whirlwind of activity. The arrival of the police, the preliminary investigation of the scene and the questioning... It was just before dawn before I was allowed back to my lodgings at 221B. 16th April, 6:21 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Ryunosuke: Oh! Iris! Iris: A telegram came. But all it said was, 'Wait at home'. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, we asked one of the policemen to have it sent. It was simply impossible to come back. Iris: When I woke up...I was all alone. Hurley and Ginny were gone. Everyone was gone. What happened, Runo? Ryunosuke: (Poor Iris. She's trembling. She's obviously trying very hard not to let herself get too worried.) ...I'll explain everything that I know. Iris: Something awful has happened, hasn't it? Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, I'm afraid so. After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: I'm afraid I'll need to go out again now, Iris. There's not much I can do at the moment... But I can at least try to find out how Mr Sholmes and Gina are getting on. Iris: I want to go, too. Take me with you, Runo! Ryunosuke: ...! Iris: I can't stand just sitting around here waiting. Ryunosuke: (I'm not sure how I feel about taking a ten-year-old child to the scene of a murder... But I don't want to leave her all alone here, either.) Alright then, Iris. Perhaps you can help me? Iris: Oh yes! I'd love to! Ryunosuke: Gina's at the prison. Mr Sholmes is...probably in his hospital bed. Iris: And don't forget we have to visit the crime scene! We need to conduct a thorough investigation! Ryunosuke: Ah, I can see you're ready for action! (I imagine Iris would appreciate going to the hospital sooner rather than later...) Sholmes's Suite Baker Street 16th April St Synner's Hospital, Ward 3 Iris: Hurley! ...Oh! He's not here! Ryunosuke: No. That's strange... The nurse definitely said he was in the bed by the window, didn't she? Iris: Ooh, I know what's probably happened! Hurley was being a big baby. And the bullet wound wasn't that bad after all so he's been sent home. Ryunosuke: Hm, I'm not so sure about that. Baby or not... ...there's no question that it was a fairly serious injury that Mr Sholmes suffered. Iris: Oh... ???: 'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere? Bobby: This ward is off limits! No visitin'! So what are you doin' in 'ere, eh? Iris: Well, I'll have you know, we're Hurley's next of kin! Bobby: Eh? ...Oh! Well beggin' your pardon then, ma'am. Sir. ...A little lady and a curious Eastern gentleman... The great mystery-solver 'as a mysterious family, eh. Ryunosuke: (...If that's how you see us, um...sure.) Iris: Where is he, Constable? Where's Hurley? Bobby: I believe 'e is currently in the operatin' theatre, ma'am. Undergoin' an extensive operation. Iris: Extensive?! Bobby: It 'as been several 'ours since 'e went in. Iris: Oh dear... Is he going to be alright? Bobby: Well, it doesn't appear to be workin', you see. The anaesthetic, that is. Iris: Oh! Bobby: I 'ave 'eard a report that the gentleman claims 'e may 'ave 'ad a little too much to drink last night. Coffee, that is. Ryunosuke: Haah... Bobby: Anyway, I think it would be fair to assume that 'e won't be back 'ere for several 'ours yet. Ryunosuke: ...I see. Thank you, Constable. Perhaps we should leave and come back later. Iris: Oh, poor Hurley... 16th April Windibank's Pawnbrokery Iris: This is where it happened, then? Last night. Ryunosuke: That's right. The two thugs I told you about were obviously ransacking the place, looking for valuables. Iris: But... ...apart from the policemen in here, you wouldn't know anything had happened. There's no sign of a disturbance. Ryunosuke: No...you're right about that, actually. Iris: In fact, if anyone, it's the police who seem to be the ones doing the ransacking. Ryunosuke: I know what you mean. They're like a gang of organised criminals, all dressed in black! ???: Oi! I heard that! Ryunosuke: Oh, Inspector! Erm... Good morning. Gregson: Hmph. I s'pose I ought to thank you for your vigilance last night. We got to the scene before it was disturbed at least. Shame you let the two rogues get away, mind. Ryunosuke: Yes... I'm sorry about that. Iris: ...I thought you'd assigned extra men to the beat around here, Gregsy. Now look what's happened! Hurley's been injured because there weren't enough police on duty! Gregson: .........Ah! Y...Y...Your Ladyship! No one told me you were comin'! Iris: I expect you to take full responsibility for what happened to Hurley and see he has the very best medical care! Gregson: Of course, Your Ladyship! The very best doctors in the capital are tendin' to him as we speak! Iris: And I don't think it's Runo's fault that the rogues managed to get away, is it? Chasing criminals is the police's job. Gregson: Absolutely, Your Ladyship! As you say, ma'am, as you say! The gent in black is totally blameless! Everyone's in agreement about that. Ryunosuke: (Would you believe it?! He's like a completely different person with Iris. Talk about a personality change...) Gregson: Oh! Where are me manners? Are you thirsty, Your Ladyship? Perhaps you'd like some juice? Some nice, refreshin' fruit juice? Iris: Oh, why? Are you thirsty, Gregsy? I have some of my special herbal tea with me, if you'd like some! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Ta very much. That really hit the spot...Your Ladyship. Ryunosuke: (I don't even recognise him like this...) After clearing all Converse options: Gregson: Oh...yeah...there's somethin' I was s'posed to talk to you about, actually, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Yes? What is it? Gregson: I've got an important message for you. I clean forgot about it until now. Ryunosuke: An important message? (I wonder what it could be...) 16th April British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: (Yes... ...no matter how many times I come here, I always get the same sense of oppressiveness somehow...) Iris: Do you think the place is oppressive? I think it's normal. Ryunosuke: How so?! Iris: I mean, look at that suit of armour over there. You can't take that seriously, can you? Ryunosuke: ...Maybe it thinks the same about you. ???: ...So everything is clear with regard to tomorrow's arrangements, I trust? ???: Yes. Thank you very much. Ryunosuke: (There they are. Susato-san and Lord Stronghart.) Iris: I wonder what they're talking about. They both look very serious. Stronghart: Very good. There is nothing further to discuss. You may return to your lodgings. No doubt you have much to do in preparation for your return to your homeland. Ryunosuke: ......... (...Wait, what did he just say? 'Your return to your homeland'...?) Susato-san! Susato: ...! Oh! Um...Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: ......... What was all that about? Susato: ......... Stronghart: Ah, Mr Naruhodo. Thank you for coming to collect your colleague. Ryunosuke: What's this all about? Why were you talking about Miss Susato's 'return to her homeland'? And, and... ...tomorrow?! Susato: ......... Iris: Tomorrow...? But what about Ginny's trial? Susato: ...! You mean... ...she's been formally charged now? Oh dear... Iris: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Stronghart: ...Three minutes precisely until my next meeting. You must excuse me. Ryunosuke: ......... There's just...one more thing, Lord Stronghart. Stronghart: Which is? Ryunosuke: It's Miss Lestrade's trial... I wonder if you might permit me to defend her? Stronghart: ......... A timely suggestion. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Stronghart: The girl currently has no representation. Iris: But, but that's not fair! Yes, she may be a pickpocket, but she still deserves a fair trial! Stronghart: ...Do not misunderstand me, young lady. The government provides for those too poor to afford representation with a public defender. The accused need only sign the relevant paperwork, and a defence barrister will be assigned to the case. However...the young girl in question has refused that right. Ryunosuke: Why would she do that? Stronghart: A question you would do well to direct at Miss Lestrade. You'll find her at the local prison. Ryunosuke: Yes, thank you. Stronghart: Now then, it's time I was leaving. Good day to you. Ryunosuke: (What a day. Gina charged with murder... Susato-san about to leave...) Susato: ......... Come, Mr Naruhodo. Iris. We must make haste. Iris: But, Susie... ...you're leaving for Japan tomorrow morning, aren't you? Don't you have packing and things to do? Susato: ......... As Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant, my personal circumstances are of no consequence. My sole purpose remains to help you in whatever way I can. Ryunosuke: ...Thank you, Miss Susato. (That's a very pensive look...) Ryunosuke: (If I'm honest, this has completely thrown me off. I'll just have to do what I can...as a lawyer...) 16th April Local Prison, Cell 13 After clearing all Converse options at Local Prison, Cell 13 and Lord Chief Justice's Office: Susato: Gina... ...I wonder if you might hear me out. There's something I'd like to say. Gina: Wot? Susato: I'm sorry to say...that I must reluctantly bid you farewell. Gina: Eh? Farewell? Susato: Tomorrow, I must begin my journey back home. To Japan. ...I fear we may never meet again. Gina: ...! Oh...right... Susato: I've had the pleasure of meeting so many lovely people here in London. I have so many wonderful memories. And yet...as things stand now... ...it will be a glum parting indeed. Poor Iris is so miserable. Iris: Susie... Gina: Well...well...that ain't my business! Susato: Both Iris and Mr Naruhodo believe you to be innocent, Gina. They've put their faith in you. But somehow...you can't find it in your heart to put your faith in them. Gina: Yeah! That's right, I can't! ...Wot of it? Susato: It grieves me greatly to have to say goodbye to my friends when they are so clearly unhappy... ...because of you. Gina: ...! Wot, it's MY fault?! Susato: Yes. So I have one final request, Gina, before our paths never cross again. Right here and now... ...I want you to show both of them that you don't deserve the faith they've invested in you. Gina: Eh?! Susato: Only by doing that... ...will you truly be as alone as you claim to be. Gina: ...! Wot are you talkin' about? Wot d'you expect me to do, eh? Susato: You've told us that everyone lies. So prove it! ...By admitting one of your own untruths. Gina: ......... Iris: What about what you said before, Ginny? You said something about unforgivable lies. Susato: You must tell Mr Naruhodo and Iris the truth now. That is my last request before I leave. My last request as a judicial assistant. Gina: No... I, I can't... Ryunosuke: (Whatever these lies are, they're obviously weighing very heavily on Gina's mind...) Gina, I could be wrong, but... ...is it something to do with what happened two months ago? Something about that trial? The one in which Magnus McGilded was acquitted? Gina: Ah... Ryunosuke: The case of that mysterious murder that took place inside the omnibus... You were called as a witness by the prosecution. Is that what this is about? Gina: ......... Yeah. You're right. Because...in that trial... ...I lied. I lied like you wouldn't believe. Ryunosuke: ......... Will you tell us about it now? Gina: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Gina: ......... I bet yer ready to string me up, eh? I lied...in that big old courtroom. I told some corkers. Ryunosuke: ......... Gina: The thing is, 'e said 'e would make it so we couldn't live in the East End no more. That's wot 'e threatened me wiv. Iris: What a wicked man... Gina: 'E knew everyfin' wot went on in the back slums. 'E knew we 'ad no one to look after us, and we was all just lookin' out for each other, gettin' by together. Susato: So you mean...Mr McGilded would have- Gina: In an 'eartbeat! 'E could've 'ad the lot of us chased out o' there if 'e'd wanted. And then where could we 'ave gone, eh? Nowhere, that's where! So... I didn't 'ave no choice. ......... Ryunosuke: Thank you, Gina, for telling us everything. Gina: But...I'm for it now, eh?! Go on, admit it! You must be livid! Ryunosuke: Well...you can make amends by doing me a simple favour. Gina: ...A favour? Wot? Ryunosuke: Sign the representation papers for tomorrow's trial. Gina: Eh?! Ryunosuke: If you don't actually want me to represent you in court, you can rip it up later. But we need that paperwork or we can't investigate. The police won't let us. Gina: Investigate wot? Ryunosuke: The scene of the incident last night. Mr Sholmes was shot, you see. Gina: You wot?! Iris: Hurley's having a big operation right now, Ginny. Gina: Is it bad?! Is, is 'e gonna be alright? Sholmes is gonna be alright...right? Iris: ......... Ryunosuke: That's why I want to investigate. For Mr Sholmes's sake as much as anything. Gina: ......... Right. So wot yer sayin' is, if I sign that bit o' paper, everyone's 'appy, is that it? Ryunosuke: Something like that. ...Miss Susato? Susato: Yes! Of course! I have the representation papers here. Gina: ......... ...I, I don't need no one to stick up for me, though. No lawyer or nuffin'. Iris: Poor Ginny... She seems so lonely. Gina's representation papers have been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: Well...at least this should mean we can investigate the scene at Windibank's now. Iris: Yes. And perhaps we can come back to visit Ginny when we're done there? Ryunosuke: (I feel like we've finally cracked Gina. She's opened up to us at last. And now I have her representation papers... No one else knows just what a responsibility that is. Anyway, for now it means Inspector Gregson can't stop us investigating at Windibank's. Although something tells me he's not going to be happy about it...) To be continued... 16th April, 1:26 p.m. Windibank's Pawnbrokery Ryunosuke: (Here we are again at the scene of the crime... Now to thrust these representation papers in Gregson's face and see what he makes of them!) Hello again, Inspector. Do you have a minute, please? Gregson: What is it now? You should go home and get some rest. Iris: Here you are, Gregsy! Here are the representation papers! Gregson: .........Your Ladyship! Hooooooooooooooooooooow?! I don't believe it! How the devil did you get that stubborn little ragabash to sign that?! I salute you! That is good work, that is. Iris: I can see you've been very busy here as well. How about some tea? It's a special blend designed to relieve fatigue! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Well, let's see now... Yes... Yes! I hardly feel tired at all! I'm fit as a fiddle, Your Ladyship! Ryunosuke: ...Would it be alright if we investigated the scene of the crime, then? Gregson: Do as you please! You know where it happened. Through that door behind the counter. Ryunosuke: (Yes, the storeroom... That's where I discovered Mr Windibank...and Gina.) Gregson: Right, well...I'll be gettin' back to business then. Ryunosuke: Will you be investigating in the storeroom as well, Inspector? Gregson: If I'm perfectly honest, we need to wrap this up before long. Can't afford to spend too much time on it. But there are so many articles to go through, it's taking forever, even with the lads workin' round the clock. Which is a problem, 'cause there's another case the Yard needs to investigate urgently. Ryunosuke: (That must be what Lord Stronghart meant by 'far more serious matters' before...) Gregson: So what I'm sayin' is, don't get under my feet, sunshine! Susato: Come then! Let us not waste any time! After clearing all Converse options: Iris: So what do you think of these stereoscopic prints then, Runo? Ryunosuke: They're certainly amazing, but it isn't easy to get the knack of viewing them properly. Iris: No, some people find it easier than others. But that's why contraptions like this exist. For people who find it tricky. Susato: Oh! I recognise that. We saw one over there yesterday, didn't we? If I remember correctly, you press this little knob here... ...then set the pair of photographs in this stand at the back and... Ryunosuke: It's still amazing, even though I know roughly how it works now. Iris: Well, London seems to agree with you. Stereoscopes are very popular at the moment. You can find one of these folding contraptions in lots of households in the capital currently. Ryunosuke: But if these little machines are so affordable... ...surely there's no need to go around staring cross-eyed at pictures like you hate them. Iris: ......... But it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Well, I think so, in any case. Ryunosuke: (Stereoscopic pictures... I'd never even heard of them until yesterday. We've certainly learnt a lot about them. But I wonder if it's knowledge that I'll ever actually need...) The second white cat photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Iris: Oh! That looks like blood! Ryunosuke: I would say it's from a gloved finger. Almost certainly a glove made of leather. iris: Well don't worry, Runo! You can leave the rest to me! Ryunosuke: Look at that... Iris: Yes, that's a colour we haven't seen before, isn't it? Susato: We simply must add it to the portfolio of blood samples! It could be an important clue. Although...it would be nice to find out whose blood these different colours correspond to at some point. Ryunosuke: ......... (Well, this particular stain of blood...) Iris: Oh! You've had an idea, haven't you? Do you know whose blood this is? Ryunosuke: Yes, I have an idea whose blood it is. Not from the colour it turned, but with a little deduction. Iris: That's right! I think it's clear. Susato: Iris, you know as well? Iris: You first, Runo. Who do you think it belongs to? Ryunosuke: Alright, I believe that this is the blood of... Ryunosuke: ...'Thrice-Fired' Mason...? Iris: You don't sound very sure of yourself, the way you trailed off there. Ryunosuke: Well it was two months ago now, that case. And of course I'd never met the victim. So I'm struggling to remember his name. He was definitely 'Thrice-Fired', though. Susato: The victim...of the omnibus case? Yes, his name was indeed Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason. But that would mean that this bloodstain... ...was left on the ticket two months ago! Ryunosuke: Yes. I think it was. Gina brought this ticket here to Windibank's yesterday. I'm suggesting that the bloodstain was already on it at that time. Iris: So it's a smear of blood from the time that Mr Mason was killed two months ago! Susato: Something else is coming back to me now... Mr McGilded was also wearing leather gloves that night. McGilded: Now I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand. Ryunosuke: It certainly does look like a leather-gloved thumbprint, this mark. But we know that Mr McGilded had no injuries at the time, anywhere on his body. From which we can conclude... ...that any blood on the glove...belonged to the victim, Mr Mason! Susato: Mr Naruhodo! You sound just like Mr Sholmes! Ryunosuke: (...Minus the quirky slip-ups, I hope.) Iris: Yes, I think you're right, Runo! Susato: Very well. Let's make a note of this. The details of the pawnbroker's ticket for the coat have been updated in the Court Record. The blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record. 16th April Local Prison, Cell 13 Ryunosuke: Gina doesn't appear to be here. Susato: I believe she must be in questioning at the moment. Iris: Oh, but...wait a minute... Ryunosuke: What is it, Iris? Iris: Well if you examine the scene here carefully, there's another possibility, isn't there? Ginny could have slipped the key from the jailer when he wasn't looking and escaped! Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: Why, why would she do something like that? It would only make her situation worse! Iris: ......... Calm down, Runo! I was only joking of course! Ryunosuke: ......... Oh. Ugh...you had me worried there. I thought it was a 'great deduction'. Susato: Yes, it must be your way with words, Iris. You're so wonderfully persuasive. Perhaps you don't fully understand the weight your words carry. Iris: Oh dear... I'm sorry. I suppose a light-hearted great detective is a contradiction in terms. Ryunosuke: Well, in the same situation, I'm sure Mr Sholmes would just have thrown his head back and guffawed. Susato: I'm not entirely sure that's helpful, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Well anyway, it looks like we won't be able to talk to Gina for a while. We should try to make progress with our investigation in the meantime. Iris: Yes. Come along then, Runo! Come along, Susie! 16th April Windibank's Storeroom Iris: ......... Ryunosuke: (Poor Iris... She's clammed up completely.) Susato: Iris is bound to find this difficult. After all, Mr Windibank's life was taken in this very room only last night. Iris: ......... Gregson: .........Ah! Ryunosuke: Wait! Inspector! Gregson: What is it now, sunshine? Ryunosuke: You took one look at me and tried to run away! Gregson: You think a Scotland Yard inspector would run away from some jumped-up little defence lawyer, do ya? Iris: ......... Gregson: I just! Well... ...I've never seen Her Ladyship lookin' like that before, is the thing. I didn't know what to say to her. Ryunosuke: (So you weren't running away from me...you were running away from a ten-year-old.) Susato: I'm afraid this is all a little much for young Iris. Some gentle reassurance might go a long way perhaps, Inspector. Gregson: Eh?! Iris: ......... Gregson: Erm... Ahem! Don't, um... Don't trouble yourself unduly, Your Ladyship. I mean...at least you're not dead, are you? Ryunosuke: ...I don't think that went very well. Gregson: ......... WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! Look! I'm in the middle of an investigation here, sunshine! And I told you not to get under my feet! Susato: And we have investigating to do ourselves. Ryunosuke: Yes. I'd like to hear more of what the socially inept inspector has to say. Iris: Oh Hurley... Ryunosuke: (And enquire into how Mr Sholmes's operation is going...) After clearing all Converse options, examining calendar, and presenting Pawnbroker's Ticket (Coat) in Windibank's Main Shop, and clearing all Converse options, examining chalk outline, red chest, and revolver in Windibank's Storeroom: *Dong* *Dong* *Dong* Iris: AAAAAAGH!!! I nearly jumped out of my skin there! How could Mr Windibank set such a wicked trap?! Ryunosuke: I...I doubt he set out to scare anyone. Susato: Is that really the time? I think perhaps we should pay Gina another visit soon. Ryunosuke: Oh? Susato: Her trial is tomorrow. We must establish whether or not you will be defending her. I think we should ask her one more time. ...She may have changed her mind. Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: Don't you remember, Runo? You told her she could rip up the representation papers if she didn't want you to be her lawyer. Ryunosuke: ...Really? Did I say that? Yes. You did. Susato: The deadline for submitting the paperwork is fast approaching. Ryunosuke: (In that case, we had better hurry back to the prison and talk to Gina again.) 16th April, 5:41 p.m. Local Prison, Cell 13 Ryunosuke: Ah, Gina, good... You're back. Gina: Ah! ......... Susato: The police must have finished questioning her, then. Iris: Oh, how was it, Ginny? Was it awful? Gina: Eh? Oh... Didn't bother me. Ryunosuke: Thank you for the papers you signed before. It meant we were able to investigate at Windibank's. Gina: Oh...right... ......... Iris: Don't you want to know how we got on? We've been ever so busy. Gina: ......... Wot's the point in askin'? Won't change wot everyone's sayin'. That I did it. Iris: That's not... Gina: ......... Ryunosuke: Gina, we came to ask for your final decision. Gina: Eh? Wot decision? Ryunosuke: About tomorrow's trial. Will you let me defend you or not? Gina: ...! Susato: I must submit the paperwork now if you'd like Mr Naruhodo to represent you. Gina: Right...I see... Ryunosuke: (She's really lost her fight all of a sudden. But I know what that feels like. The worry is just so hard to bear...) Ryunosuke: Those stains on the sleeves of your new coat, Gina... They're blood, aren't they? Not that I know whose blood yet. Gina: WOT?! Susato: B-Blood, Mr Naruhodo?! Ryunosuke: You don't appear to have any obvious wounds yourself, though. So could it be blood that spattered from Mr Windibank when he was shot last night? Iris: Let's not beat around the bush here. This trusty friend of mine will get results much faster than anything else! Gina: Eh?! T-Take it easy, Iris! Iris: Don't move, Ginny! I'm going to shoot! Oh... Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: What the...? Forget the sleeves... Iris: ...The whole coat is covered in blood! Ryunosuke: (Of course! The black colour of the fabric was masking the stains. That's why we haven't seen them until now!) Susato: And the blood has reacted with the chemical to turn a purple colour... ...which matches one of the samples we've already collected perfectly! Iris: Yes, now let's see...who had the purple blood? Aha! Yes, it was the brickmaker, Mr Mason. The victim of the murder case two months ago. Ryunosuke: ......... (I knew it...) Gina: Wot, wot are you all on about? The victim? Wot d'you mean? Susato: ......... It's a rather uncomfortable situation, Mr Naruhodo, but I think this makes things quite clear. It means the omnibus case is finally solved. The truth about who really murdered the brickmaker, Mr Mason...is revealed. Gina: Oi! Would someone explain wot's goin' on?! Stop tellin' 'alf a story! Susato: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Susato: Gina...may I ask you something? Gina: Wot? Susato: I'd just like to make absolutely sure... What would you like us to do with these representation papers for tomorrow's trial? Gina: ......... 'Ow many times do I 'ave to say it? Rip 'em up and chuck 'em away. Susato: Are you really sure that's what you want? Gina: I bet that's wot 'e wants an' all now. Mr 'I'm-a-Believer' Lawyer over there. Ryunosuke: ......... Gina: Don't forget it was me in that trial two months ago. I led everyone up the garden path, didn't I? An' yer tellin' me you can believe in me after that? Not likely. Susato: ......... Well, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: (A lawyer's primary weapon is an unwavering belief in his clients... Ultimately it comes down to whether or not I feel I can trust Gina after everything that's happened...) Ryunosuke: Gina...let me say it again... Please allow me to represent you in tomorrow's trial. Gina: Eh? Are you 'alf-baked? Ryunosuke: Not at all. You've not once admitted to committing the crime, have you? What's more...I believe that you're telling me the truth. Gina: ......... Seriously, um...Mr Narrow-'Oddo... ...didn't you 'ear all of wot I said before? I'm a born liar. Fibs just trip off me tongue. And I'm a diver, don't forget. I pulled the wool over yer eyes two months ago and got you into all sorts o' trouble. Why would you ever trust me now? I just don't get it! Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Gina... Gina: ...! Susato: ...I do understand why you choose not to put your trust in others. But I assure you, there is more to this life than you yet realise. Gina: Wot d'you mean? Susato: The world we live in... ...is full of people you would do very well to trust. People who won't ever let you down. Gina: Eh? Ryunosuke: It's true that I'm just a student of law, and I'm certainly lacking in courtroom experience. But I can promise you this: Whatever happens...and until my very last breath... ...I am completely on your side! Gina: ......... Wot...wot d'you expect me to say to that? ......... Susato: Then it's decided. I will take these papers now and carry out the necessary preparations for tomorrow's trial. It would be a shame to throw them away now after it's been penned with your name so beautifully. Gina: ...Do wot you like. You Eastern lot are...are... I dunno wot you are! I don't get ya! Ryunosuke: (Gina's taken herself off to the back of her cell. She'd never admit it, but I hope she's feeling relieved. That turned out alright in the end...I think.) ........................... Susato: Whoever's hiding there... ...show yourself at once! Eavesdropping is the height of cowardice! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato?! Susato: Somebody is there in the shadows. I can sense it. Somebody who wasn't there before! Ryunosuke: What?! ???: ......... ...Blimey, you're sharp, eh? Gregson: I s'pose you were usin' one of those mystic Japanese arts. Like the art of stealth I've heard so much about. Ryunosuke: ...If anyone was being stealthy, it was you, Inspector. Iris: Gregsy! Gregson: Oh dear me, I am most terribly sorry, Your Ladyship! I didn't mean to startle you! Iris: How long have you been listening in on our conversation? Gregson: Good grief! Listenin' in?! No no no! I just got word that there were some visitors who were refusin' to leave even though it was after hours. I assure you, Your Ladyship, I only just arrived. This very minute! Not a moment earlier! That's all it is! Nothin' untoward! Nothin' at all! Ryunosuke: After hours...? Is it that late already? Gregson: So then, I'll humbly excuse myself now, Your Ladyship. Ta-ta! Toodle-oo! Cheerio! All the best! Bye, by and by! Ryunosuke: (That's a lot of farewells, and not one of them appropriate for 'Her Ladyship'.) Iris: Oh, but I wanted to have a chat! Gregson: I'm, I'm terribly sorry, but time is pressin' at the minute. Iris: Oh, I see. ...That's a shame. Gregson: If I don't get this emergency at the Supreme Court dealt with sharpish, Lord  Stronghart will, well... Iris: Emergency?! Ryunosuke: Lord Stronghart? Gregson: Nothin'! Forget I said anythin'! Anyway...ahem! I'm off! Iris: Alright, Gregsy, if you have to. But let's chat soon! Gregson: Delighted! Charmed! Can't wait! If you please! My pleasure! Ryunosuke: (That's a lot of pleasantries, and not one of them sounded sincere...) Iris: Gregsy's so funny! He says such silly things! Ryunosuke: It's certainly entertaining to see an inspector of the police fawning to a ten-year-old girl. (But anyway, I wonder what this emergency is at the Supreme Court...) Susato: I must attend the court clerk's office now before it closes. Ryunosuke: Yes, of course. Thank you, Miss Susato. Susato: ......... Kindly escort Iris home now, Mr Naruhodo. I shall meet you there later. Ryunosuke: And so our investigation came to an end. Susato-san went to file the necessary papers for my defence of Gina the following day. And then it hit me... I could no longer suppress the wretched feeling that had been gnawing away at my insides. Tomorrow...Susato-san would be leaving. Leaving Britain and making her way back to Japan. 16th April, 11:13 p.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Susato: Naruhodo-san... ...it's been a very trying day, hasn't it? I do hope you're not too exhausted. Ryunosuke: What about you, Susato-san? Today has been even more trying for you, I'm sure. (Mr Sholmes was shot before our eyes, Gina was arrested... ...all on the back of the news that her father has fallen ill and that she must return to Japan at once.) I...hope your father recovers soon. Susato: Thank you for your kind words. ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: I wonder why it is... ...that so many thoughts rage in my head like a storm... ...and yet I seem unable to find the words to express any of them. Ryunosuke: I know exactly what you mean. Susato: Anyway, I have one final task to complete as your judicial assistant. Once that is done, I shall make preparations for my departure tomorrow. Ryunosuke: (One final task...?) After clearing all Converse options: Susato: Well...it's getting rather late. I think you should go to bed now, Naruhodo-san. I must finish packing up my things in my room. Ryunosuke: Susato-san, I... Susato: I wish you the very best of luck tomorrow! ...Good night. Ryunosuke: Wait! There's, there's something I need to say! Susato: Haiiiiii-YA! Ryunosuke: What, what was that...? Susato: A secret technique of mine... The 'Susato Shutdown'. Ryunosuke: Shutdown? Susato: ......... Please...I implore you... If we have to voice our goodbyes... ...I won't be able to hold back my tears. Ryunosuke: ......... Susato-san... It truly had been a trying day. On our feet for hours... Getting Gina to open up to us... And learning the truth about that nemesis of a case. Physically and mentally, I was exhausted. And yet the idea of sleep seemed impossible. But I forced myself to close my eyes... ...eventually...my fatigue triumphed, and I fell into a deep sleep. ...................................................... 17th April, the Small Hours St Synner's Hospital, Ward 3 ???: ...Yes, I quite understand. ???: That is a great weight off my mind. Sholmes: Rest assured, I shall put everything in place, exactly as we have discussed. ???: Thank you so much. It has been an honour and a pleasure to be acquainted with you, Mr Sholmes. Sholmes: On the contrary. The pleasure has been mine. I bid you farewell...and Godspeed... ...my dear madam. To be continued...\nNash: We woz walkin' down Baker Street in the small hours, an' the gaff's door was ajar, see?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The front door of Windibank's was ajar, you say? What time of night was this? Nash: Must've been about one. ...Right, Ringo? Ringo: Yeah, I'd say so. ...Right, Sulky? Gregson: How would I know? The place would've been shut at one in the mornin'. Just like every other shop in town. Nash: Well it woz pitch-black inside, it's true. ...Ain't that right, Ringo? Ringo: I'm not so sure, Nash. I seem to remember a little light burnin' inside. Wot about you, Sulky, me old mucker? Gregson: ...Leave me alone. Ryunosuke: (There definitely was a small lamp burning inside. That's what alerted us to the situation in the first place.) Van Zieks: And when these gentlemen ventured into the open establishment... ...the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, already had the muzzle of her gun trained on the unfortunate victim. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That is pure conjecture! Judge: Hmmm... Van Zieks: Hah, perhaps. But it changes nothing. These brothers inadvertently wandered into the middle of a cold-blooded murder... ...simply because they found the door of the victim's establishment open and ventured inside. Nash: Right! That's wot 'appened!Ringo: It woz like some kinda sign. Beggin' for us to go in, it woz!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What are you trying to suggest? That you had to go in? Nash: Well, God moves in mysterious ways, they say, dun't they, Ringo? Ringo: They do, Nash, they do. Must've been some sort o' providence, I reckon. Ryunosuke: ...God's will often presents itself as the whim of thieves, does it? Nash: It weren't no whim. I'm dead sure o' that. Ringo: It weren't, Nash, it weren't. Like we said at the time... Nash: ...Ya don't just find doors open in the middle o' the night like that. Nah, there's no two ways about it... Ringo: ...It woz a sign that our long-lost bruvver was inside! Iris: They're not very good liars, are they? Ringo: Well...ya can't deny it. It led us to a bloke wot looks just like our bruv! Gregson: ...I said, cut it out. Ryunosuke: (Those chips are getting a chomping today...)Nash: But once we got inside, cor blimey lummy! We 'eard a gunshot from the back room!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A gunshot, you say. Just the one. Are you sure about that? Nash: Yup, just the one, guvnor. I can swear to that. Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. ...Ain't that right, Bruv? Gregson: ...The firearm used belonged to the victim himself. Iris: Yes, Mr Windibank always used to leave his gun lying around on the counter. Ryunosuke: Right. I remember. Gregson: When we examined it, we found the revolver was completely out of rounds. Iris: That makes sense. Mr Windibank always used to say he only ever kept a single bullet loaded. Ryunosuke: (That's true. I remember him saying that as well.) Judge: So we can say with considerable certainty... ...that only a single round was discharged from the firearm used as the murder weapon. Gregson: Yes, My Lord. We can. Van Zieks: And I should remind the court... ...that the firearm in question was discovered in the hand of the accused. Judge: Hmmm... Ryunosuke: (...Wonderful.)Ringo: We went to see wot woz wot, but the door was locked from the inside.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you mean the door between the main shop and the storeroom? Van Zieks: If my learned friend is having difficulty grasping the situation, perhaps a drawing would help. Excluding the shop's entrance from the street, there is only one other door. That of the storeroom. Nash: 'Course there woz only a little oil lamp burnin'. Not much to see by. Ringo: An' the door woz 'idden be'ind a curtain an' all. Ryunosuke: (That's right. When we arrived, the door was mostly obscured by the curtain.) Tell me... ...why exactly did you try to open that door? Ringo: Eh? Ryunosuke: Any normal petty thief would run at the sound of a gunshot, I should think. Nash: Oh, well, erm...your turn to rabbit, Ringo. Ringo: Well, Nash, erm...yeah... ...I s'pose...you'd 'ave to say we ain't 'normal', eh? Van Zieks: Broadly speaking, humans respond in one of two ways on hearing a gunshot or scream: The timid flee, gripped by fear, while the courageous investigate to see if they might help. These gentlemen are of the latter inclination. My learned Nipponese friend, it would seem, is of the former. Ryunosuke: (Alright... Somehow I just proved that I was a coward that night...) Judge: Thank you, Counsels... So, I believe we all understand that the door was locked and could not be opened. Proceed, witnesses...Nash: We never done nuffin', guvnor! We never took nuffin'! We just left after that, nice an' quiet.Press Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"You didn't do or take anything...\"Iris: What do you think about this pair, Runo?Ryunosuke: I think they're lying through their teeth, that's what I think. And I'm going to prove it!Iris: .........Ryunosuke: What is it, Iris?Iris: Weeell...I'm not really sure. There's just something a bit funny...about that prosecutor over there.Ryunosuke: Hm? (Wait, could this... ...could this testimony be some sort of a trap?)Ryunosuke: You didn't do or take anything... Is that your story?Nash: Well it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: So with no time to take your hands out of your pockets, you just left, nice and quietly, you say?Nash: That's right, guvnor. Nuffin' we 'ate more than violence. Peace-lovin' nibblers, we are, not bludgers.Ringo: We are, Nash, we are. Never even pulled me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: ...So, you'd clearly like us to believe...Nash: Eh? Come again...?Ryunosuke: As you fled from the pawnbroker's that night... ...did you not run into anyone else?Nash: Um...Ryunosuke: And...did you not fire a gun at that person?!Ringo: Erm...Judge: Saints alive! They fired a gun, you say?Nash: AAAAAAGH!!! Blimey, guvnor!Ringo: You ain't tellin' us it woz you in the doorway?!Ryunosuke: It was.Ringo: ......... Why the bleedin' Nora...Nash: ...Didn't ya mention that before?!Ryunosuke: You were armed with a gun. And as you fled the scene, you fired that gun... ...at London's greatest detective, Herlock Sholmes!They shot the great Mr Sholmes? I did hear that, actually. There was a rumour he'd been rushed to hospital....The great Sholmes? That's beyond the pale!Van Zieks: On the night in question... ...this pair were arrested by the police within minutes of the discovery of the crime scene. ...Their suspicious countenance rapidly gave them away.Ringo: Hehe...Van Zieks: And when searched... ...a firearm was indeed found in their possession.Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Van Zieks: Furthermore, the barrel shows signs of a shot having been fired from it.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Van Zieks: The prosecution invites His Lordship to examine the firearm recovered from these brothers.Judge: Yes, indeed... Remnants of powder around the muzzle, as you say, Counsel.Juror No. 5: ...!Juror No. 6: ...!Judge: The court will hold this weapon as evidence.The Skulkin brothers' gun has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: Now, my learned Nipponese friend...Examine evidence Skulkin Brothers' Gun Bullet cylinder Ryunosuke: So, there's ammunition still loaded in five of this revolver's six cylinders. Iris: Yes, which tell us that only a single shot has been fired from it. Ryunosuke: Exactly. Iris: The bullet that hit Hurley in fact, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes... It happened almost as soon as we'd walked in through Windibank's door. Iris: ......... I'll make those brothers pay.Ryunosuke: Y-Yes?Van Zieks: Here's to you successfully presenting the evidence.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: For yes, there are the telltale signs of spent powder on this gun, and a single bullet missing from the cylinder... ...but the prosecution demands evidence that it was fired at the scene of the crime under scrutiny in this trial!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Well, I don't need evidence! Because I was there!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ...However, the rest of us in this courtroom were not.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: If the defence fails to provide evidence in support of its rash claim... ...we shall have no choice but to toast your incompetence...and move on.Ryunosuke: (Evidence that these two fired that gun before they left Windibank's that night...)Judge: The court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof. What evidence shows that these witnesses unloaded a firearm in the pawnbroker's shop that night?Present Blood Samples Portfolio Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The evidence...is in this portfolio!\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The evidence...is this! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: My learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"The court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof.\"Ryunosuke: The evidence...is in this portfolio!Judge: What, what on earth have you there, Counsel?Ryunosuke: During the course of our investigations, we discovered a number of bloodstains.Van Zieks: ...Not trusting the police to do the job they're trained to do? How arrogantly Nipponese of you.Ryunosuke: W-Well anyway... ...we analysed all the blood samples we found and recorded the results in this portfolio.Judge: And you claim to have the evidence the court is demanding therein?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord.Judge: No more dallying then, Counsel. Present the pertinent evidence at once! What do you have in your portfolio that proves these witnesses unloaded a firearm at the scene?Present Windibank's Main Shop sample Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"What is that? Explain!\"Present any other sample Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: THIS is the blood sample that proves it! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"No more dallying then, Counsel.\"Judge: What is that? Explain!Ryunosuke: It's a photographic print taken at Windibank's pawnbrokery on the day of the incident.Judge: From the scene of the crime, is it? Is, is that... ...a bullet hole? And if my eyes do not deceive me, it appears the bullet is still lodged there.Ryunosuke: Yes, as Your Lordship noticed... ...the bullet pierced Mr Windibank's calendar. The date shown being the 16th of April - the very day of the pawnbroker's death.Judge: The incident occurred at one hour after midnight. But this indicates that a separate shot had been fired sometime after the calendar had been set to the 16th!Ryunosuke: That's right. And while it isn't irrefutable, the defence believes... ...this is credible evidence that the witnesses did fire a round from their gun in the pawnbroker's that night!Nash: NAAAAAAAAAH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! ...How does the prosecution stand, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: ......... If that is the direction my learned friend wishes to take, the prosecution has no objection.Ryunosuke: What?Van Zieks: But you'll forgive me for flinging my hallowed chalice aside in disgust at the repugnancy it exposes. Yes. On the night in question, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery illegally... ...and like the bold 'baddies' they claim to be, opened fire on the new arrivals before fleeing back onto the street!Nash: EEEEEEH?! Take it easy there, guvnor! Yer gonna land us in the soup!Ringo: We 'ad a deal! You weren't gonna get into them...details. Tell 'im, Sulky! Set the bloke straight!Gregson: ...I have nothin' to add.Ryunosuke: (So he knew, did he? Van Zieks knew their testimony would almost certainly expose the extent of their crimes.)Van Zieks: It would seem now... ...that I owe my learned Nipponese friend a word of gratitude.Ryunosuke: What do you mean?Van Zieks: What I mean...is that you have helpfully confirmed an important fact.Judge: To what fact do you refer, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: As has been established, at the point of their arrest, a single shot had been fired from the brothers' gun. However, if that shot found its target in Mr Sholmes... ...then clearly these witnesses cannot be accused of the fatal shooting of the proprietor and victim.Ryunosuke: Agh!Van Zieks: In other words...these two men... ...have no material connection to the murder of Mr Windibank at all!Ryunosuke: ...! (So that's it...)Nash: That's it! We didn't 'ave nuffin' to do wiv it!Ringo: We didn't, Nash, we didn't! That's wot I reckon!Van Zieks: Your crimes include unlawful entry, intent to steal, perjury and - let us not forget - attempted murder.Gregson: Quite a catalogue, eh, fellas?Nash: Ah...Ringo: We're in for it now, bruv...Van Zieks: Now then... ...let us take a moment to consider the aforementioned 'great detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes. It would seem the man patronised the pawnbroker's in question somewhat regularly.Ryunosuke: (Where's he going with this?)Van Zieks: Mr Sholmes appears to take pleasure in tinkering with eccentric machinery.Iris: 'Eccentric'? Says who?!Ryunosuke: ...Not me. Don't give me that look!Van Zieks: He installed a pair of machines like this one in the victim's shop.Iris: Oh! That's one of Hurley's 'Red-Handed Recorders'!Judge: What is that, Counsel? It has the appearance of a photographic contraption.Van Zieks: As Your Lordship has surmised, it is indeed a camera attached to a small timing device.Ryunosuke: Every half an hour, it automatically photographs the interior of the establishment. The idea being that if a thief were to break in to the shop, he would be caught red-handed.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: The prosecution has obtained the photographs taken by the device on the night in question. As the court will observe, copious identical prints are produced in a quite desultory fashion.Judge: Hmph, rather prodigal, I feel.Van Zieks: In fact there are two such devices in the victim's shop, My Lord. If I may refer the court to the plan of the premises, their respective positions are here...and here.Judge: You say these cameras produce a print every half hour. I'm afraid I fail to see... ...how that would help if the anticipated thief conducted his activities in one of the many thirty-minute intervals.Van Zieks: One can only pray that the would-be criminal lingers, My Lord.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: On the night in question, the witnesses currently in the stand were not caught on camera.Nash: Hehe, that's a bit o' Friar Tuck, eh, bruv?Ringo: Lady Luck luvs a Skulkin!Judge: Witnesses, at what time did your trespassing begin?Nash: Eh? ...Must've been just after one. ...Right, bruv?Ringo: Must've been, Nash, must've been. Yeah, just gone one.Van Zieks: In which case, minutes before these brothers entered the establishment... ...what scene might we expect to see within the shop? Let us examine the evidence...Judge: Good Lord! It's...it's the defendant! Miss Gina Lestrade!Van Zieks: As the court can clearly see... ...the accused is pictured, gun in hand, facing the victim over the shop counter. No doubt coercing the proprietor to open the door to his storeroom.Judge: Quite! One can only too easily imagine the events that unfolded. The court will take this photographic print as evidence, if you please, Counsel.The photograph of Gina has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke: Ugh...Iris: I, I don't believe it! Ginny...Van Zieks: In short... ...the accused is the only person who could possibly have killed Mr Windibank.Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!???:I say, My Lord...Juror No. 1: Wonder if I might put in a word at this point.Judge: Go ahead, Mr Foreman.Juror No. 1: Took a bally bullet to the knee in the Battle of Maiwand, 1880, don't you know. Decorated for it and all that, but forced to retire from service, sadly. 'Course, a medal can never outshine the exploits of chaps like us on the battlefield.Judge: Yes, Mr Foreman, and...? What exactly is your point?Juror No. 1: Carried on the battle after retirement, you see. The battle of daily life, if you like. And here I am now, leading this small squadron. Six men, all good and true. And we'll all go down together, you mark my words! One for all...and all for one!Van Zieks: ...The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have reached agreement, have they? Is that what we are to understand?Judge: Well, Mr Foreman? Is that correct?Juror No. 1: ......... In a manner of speaking...yes. That is the Garrideb Squadron's position, sir!Ryunosuke: What?! No! It's too soon to make a judgement here!Juror No. 1: Status report for the court, men! On the double!Juror No. 2: His Lordship insists on promptitude at all times. And that goes for making decisions, too.Juror No. 3: I think you'll find the truth is as clear as day now! I could reach out and touch it!Juror No. 4: I wouldn't have left it in there. I just wouldn't. But in all honesty, I can't actually remember...Juror No. 5: Situation clear. Stop. No room for doubt. Stop. Truth now undeniable. Stop.Juror No. 6: I am wery sorry for brothers. They are unlucky.Judge: Very well... ...I now call upon each member of the jury to state his or her leaning in this matter. Announce your considered verdicts to the court!Juror No. 1: Guilty!Juror No. 2: Guilty!Juror No. 3: Guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Guilty!Judge: It does indeed appear that the jury is unanimous in its leaning already.Ryunosuke: (That photograph... It must be the definitive evidence that Gregson mentioned!)Iris: But Ginny didn't shoot him!Ryunosuke: No, of course not! My Lord! The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination!Judge: Very well. The court grants permission.Van Zieks: So...you refuse to admit defeat again. How...unsurprising.Judge: We shall proceed immediately with the summation examination. Mr Foreman, are all members of the jury ready?Juror No. 1: Abso-bally-lutely, sir! Always ready for action, my chaps!Judge: ...Very good. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have determined the defendant to be guilty!Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1: All the evidence clearly points the finger of guilt at this young pickpocketienne.Juror No. 2: As a housemaid, I should like to see all filthy eyesores promptly and rigorously eliminated.Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you look at that photograph in stereo, the truth will just pop out.Juror No. 4: If I have left it in there, I should think there'll be repercussions by now...Juror No. 5: Mind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.Juror No. 6: In motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.Judge: Hmmm... The circumstance of the crime and the evidence do indeed implicate the defendant rather comprehensively.Van Zieks: The storeroom, locked from the inside, in which the victim and the accused were discovered alone. And in the accused's hand, the fatal revolver, the firing of which was heard by these witnesses.Juror No. 1: Not to mention this print! Take it from a chap whose [sic] seen action on the battlefield: That young girl's on the verge of pulling the bally trigger!Ryunosuke: (...Thanks a lot, Mr Sholmes.)Iris: Oh dear... Hurley's cameras were supposed to help, not hinder.Judge: I'm afraid I think you have an uphill struggle ahead of you.Ryunosuke: (But Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank. Which means there's more to this situation that we've yet to see.)Iris: Agreed!Judge: You have the floor, Counsel. Proceed with the summation examination!Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1: All the evidence clearly points the finger of guilt at this young pickpocketienne.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You're Mr Natsume's landlord, Mr Garrideb...aren't you? We really must stop meeting like this. Juror No. 1: ......... Ah, you're that lawyer chap. Well, there's a turn-up for the books! Yes, rather a turbulent time we had back then. Ryunosuke: Some extraordinary events took place at your house, that's for sure. Luckily Mr Sholmes and I were able to get to the bottom of it all. Juror No. 1: ...! Ryunosuke: I think we did rather a lot for you, didn't we? Juror No. 1: ......... Ryunosuke: I mean, obviously... ...I wouldn't be suggesting that therefore you should change your leaning to not guilty or anything! Juror No. 1: ......... Hmph. Can't be denied, I suppose. The 'curse of the Garrideb house' was the talk of the town after that business. Lodgers moved out, and I couldn't get a bally soul to take up the tenancies. Ryunosuke: Oh. Juror No. 1: Haven't had the heart to break the news to Joanie yet. Bad enough that the old girl's clapped up. Yes, can't be denied...you did do rather a lot. But not for us, that's for dashed certain. Ryunosuke: I suppose not... Juror No. 1: 'Course... ...there can be no suggestion of that being the reason I'm leaning towards guilty here, obviously. Ryunosuke: (...Obviously. But honestly... ...I really wish he'd pay more attention to the trial, and less to juror number two.)Juror No. 2: As a housemaid, I should like to see all filthy eyesores promptly and rigorously eliminated.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...Polishing the bench, I see...again. Juror No. 2: A maid's work is never done. Not a blemish must remain. Ryunosuke: Um, what exactly do you mean by 'filthy eyesores'? Juror No. 2: On my way to market for His Lordship, I have to pass through the East End. The place is full of beggars, pickpurses and crossmen. The scum of the earth! Ryunosuke: ...A little harsh, perhaps. Juror No. 2: Let me be plain... If it were up to me, all those back slums would be made spick and span or eradicated. At least we have people like the great detective working to achieve these important goals. Ryunosuke: You're referring to Mr Herlock Sholmes? Juror No. 2: That's right. I like to keep abreast of his exploits by reading Randst Magazine in between my duties. He does wonders, cleaning up London's streets. In my opinion, he should be declared an honorary maid of the capital. Ryunosuke: ...Mr Sholmes? ...A maid? Juror No. 2: It's really quite unforgivable... Gutter scum having the audacity to shoot our very greatest detective! Ryunosuke: ......... Minor detail: It was the two brothers in the stand who shot Mr Sholmes, not the defendant. Juror No. 2: A minor detail indeed. They're all gutter scum as far as I'm concerned! Ryunosuke: Weeell...it just might be an idea to get our facts straight anyway... Juror No. 2: ...Yes, alright. I shall amend my statement. Changes Juror No. 2's statement to \"Those brothers are the scum of the earth! They should swing for shooting the great detective!\"Juror No. 2: Those brothers are the scum of the earth! They should swing for shooting the great detective!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I agree with you. The shooting of Mr Sholmes was an unforgivable act. But the purpose of this trial is to determine who shot the pawnbroker, Mr Windibank. Juror No. 2: ...I'm afraid you're splitting hairs, sir. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Juror No. 2: Whether it was the thieves or the pickpurse... ...it was still gutter trash that shot the pawnbroker in the end. Filth that should be cleaned up and eradicated...in my considered opinion. Ryunosuke: (Thanks so much for sharing. ...Changing this maid's mind isn't going to be easy.) Iris: Runo... ...it was one of those two brothers that shot Hurley, wasn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes. Without question. Iris: Well then I'll never forgive them! Ryunosuke: Oh, Iris... Iris: Perhaps we can use this maid's statement to help us somehow, do you think? Ryunosuke: Yes, maybe. Let's listen carefully to what each juror has to say first...Pit against Juror No. 6's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself! Juror No.2: Oh my! My statement? Contradictory? Juror No. 6: Contradict... C-o-n... Ryunosuke: Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick. Juror No. 6: ...I do not have stick. I have mouse. Ryunosuke: As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver. Juror No. 2: Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand! Ryunosuke: ...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d... Ryunosuke: ...Sir? Juror No. 6: Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning. Ryunosuke: ...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Forgive me. I did not hear. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 6: ...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker. Ryunosuke: (...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!) Juror No. 6: So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative. Ryunosuke: Yes! That's exactly right! Juror No. 6: Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal! Ryunosuke: ...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced. Juror No. 6: This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?! Ryunosuke: Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so... Juror No. 6: Enough! I trust no one now! Ryunosuke: ...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir. Juror No. 6: I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself! Ryunosuke: I'm afraid that won't be poss- Iris: Yes it is, Runo! Easily! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder! Ryunosuke: Ah... Iris: If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor! Van Zieks: Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight. Iris: So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken. Ryunosuke: (That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.) Juror No. 6: So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing. Ryunosuke: It would seem so, yes. Juror No. 6: Good. Ryunosuke: No, not good. Juror No. 6: You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial. Iris: Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting! Ryunosuke: Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still! Judge: Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence. The post-shooting photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: (Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...) Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.\"Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you look at that photograph in stereo, the truth will just pop out.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you mean, 'look at the photograph in stereo'? Juror No. 3: Sorry? What? Don't, don't you know? If you look at the photographic print normally... ...it looks as though the pickpocket girl is about to shoot the victim, obviously. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But there's no indication that the defendant ever fired the gun! Juror No. 3: All I'm saying is that if you look at the same print in stereo, it could reveal all sorts of new information. Ryunosuke: ......... By any chance... ...are you a fan of stereoscopes? Juror No. 3: Ooooooh! How did you know?! Ryunosuke: ...Let's call it a lucky guess. Juror No. 3: It never gets old, seeing the two prints merge into one before your eyes! It's extraordinary! It's captivating! It's the height of modernity! Ryunosuke: ...Of course. Juror No. 3: Oh yes! I think you'll find that the stereoscope is here to stay! Giving us new perspectives we could only dream of before, it's the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Ryunosuke: (...If only it could give me a new perspective on this case, I might agree with you.)Juror No. 3: All we'd need is another shot from a slightly different location, and we could see the scene in three dimensions!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Can it really show up new clues, though? Juror No. 3: Don't know unless you try! Ryunosuke: How about this print here? It should do the trick, I think. Present Photograph of Gina or Post-Shooting Photograph Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Alright then, juror number three... ...are you saying you can do this with any two suitable photographic prints? Juror No. 3: Of course I can! Ryunosuke: Very well then...I'd like you to demonstrate. Juror No. 3: I'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all! Present Post-Shooting Photograph or Photograph of Gina (whichever has not been presented yet) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Wait, sorry? What do you mean, one more print? Juror No. 3: Oh dear, oh dear... Don't you have these in the Far East? Don't you know how a stereoscope works? Iris: Runo! Ryunosuke: What? Iris: You need two photographs for a stereoscope, remember? You know, one for the left eye, and one for the right. Ryunosuke: Oh, oh yes. I remember now. But the print we have from the pawnbrokery is just a normal photograph. Juror No. 3: No no no. I think you'll find... ...that the clue is in the name. It's a stereoscope, not a monoscope! You always need two prints! Ryunosuke: (...Thanks for the friendly explanation.) Iris: Hmmm... Well, if we obtain another print at some point later in the trial... ...we can always show it to this young man then. Juror No. 3: Hahaha! Ryunosuke: (I think you'll find...that know-it-all expression is really starting to annoy me.) Judge: Let's get things back on track, shall we, Counsel? Leads back to summation examination Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Ugh...I was wrong. I can't actually think of anything we could use at all. Iris: What? Really? Oh dear, I think maybe I need to have a stereoscopic look at your brain sometime. Ryunosuke: (...What's that supposed to mean?) Leads back to summation examinationJuror No. 4: If I have left it in there, I should think there'll be repercussions by now...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um, what exactly have you been muttering about all this time, sir? You keep talking about having left something somewhere or something like that. Juror No. 4: Ah...so sorry. As you can probably tell, I'm a surgeon. Ryunosuke: A surgeon?! (That totally passed me by...) Juror No. 4: Of course, people conducting surgery in this country aren't considered to be doctors. Oh no! Even though me and my kind are at the forefront of medical science! The real brains in the field! Ryunosuke: So...what is it that you think you've left behind? Juror No. 4: Ah well, that's...a little embarrassing, to be honest. You see I was operating on someone yesterday. Standard thing - went in through the abdomen. But when I'd finished the procedure, I... Well, I couldn't find my scalpel anywhere. Ryunosuke: What?! (Did he...? Surely not!) Juror No. 4: Exactly! 'Surely not!' you say to yourself, don't you? Worrying, isn't it? That's what's been troubling me this whole time. Could I really have left my scalpel inside the fellow's belly? ...No, of course I couldn't! So...there you have it. Like I said, a little embarrassing, really. Ryunosuke: ...That's one way of putting it. The other is manslaughter. Juror No. 4: That's exactly my concern! And seeing as this case appears to be all but sewn up... ...I need to focus on trying to remember exactly what I've sewn up elsewhere! Now...I'm sure I made sure everything was back as it should be. Well, as sure as you can be without being sure. Ryunosuke: (...I'm sure you need to be more sure.)Juror No. 5: Mind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Sorry, 'radio transmission'? What do you mean? Juror No. 5: ...Are you from the Far East? Stop. Ryunosuke: Um, yes. From the Empire of Japan. Juror No. 5: All communication with Far Eastern nations used to take place by mail. Royal Mail steamers take more than a month to complete the journey. Iris: Ah, but now we have the electric telegram. So we can send messages using electrical signals. Thousands of miles of cables have been laid along the ocean beds, connecting the entire world. Ryunosuke: Thousands of miles of cable? ...On the ocean bed? (It makes my head hurt just thinking about it.) Juror No. 5: You are well informed, young lady. Iris: Hehe! Juror No. 5: But cables will soon become a thing of the past. Stop. Ryunosuke: ...And just when I was starting to catch up. Juror No. 5: Radio transmission is the future. Stop. Messages carried over airwaves to four corners of globe. Stop. Excitement growing! Stop. Atmosphere electric! Stop. Ryunosuke: Right... (...Try not to wear out your fingers.) Juror No. 5: Era of wireless telegraphy! Stop. Driving technological revolution! Stop. And people say inventions like the stereoscope are the height of technology! What utter piffle! I can't understand it. I really can't. They're just silly toys! Pursue Juror No. 3 Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Erm, juror number three...sorry to interrupt when you're obviously fuming, but... Juror No. 3: What?! Ryunosuke: Do you perhaps have something to say about juror number five's last remark? ...As if I couldn't guess. Juror No. 3: Oh, you bet I do! Say that again! Go on! I dare you! Juror No. 5: Goodness! Are you talking to me? Ryunosuke: ...I think he just might be, yes. Juror No. 3: You think stereoscopes are just toys, do you? Huh? Juror No. 5: Absolutely. I mean, really! A machine to view photographs in three dimensions? Why on earth would you not just use your eyes to look at the world around you? It's all three-dimensional! Ryunosuke: ...What a great way to appease the man. Juror No. 5: No, I'm sorry. Stereoscopes are of no practical use at all. Juror No. 3: ......... You just don't know! Juror No. 5: Pardon? Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that viewing a photograph through a stereoscope... ...can unlock all sorts of possibilities! I'm obviously going to have to demonstrate! Ryunosuke: What sort of possibilities? Juror No. 3: Well, take a crime scene, for example. If you had a pair of photographs from a crime scene that you could view through a stereoscope... ...it could reveal hidden clues you'd never even noticed before! Ryunosuke: What?! Iris: Have you got any, Runo? Any prints we could look at with a stereoscope? Absolutely! Ryunosuke: How about this print here? It should do the trick, I think. Present Photograph of Gina or Post-Shooting Photograph Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Alright then, juror number three... ...are you saying you can do this with any two suitable photographic prints? Juror No. 3: Of course I can! Ryunosuke: Very well then...I'd like you to demonstrate. Juror No. 3: I'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all!

Changes Juror No. 3's statement to \"All we'd need is another shot from a slightly different location, and we could see the scene in three dimensions!\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Ugh...I was wrong. I can't actually think of anything we could use at all. Iris: What? Really? Oh dear, I think maybe I need to have a stereoscopic look at your brain sometime. Ryunosuke: (...What's that supposed to mean?) Leads back to summation examination None spring to mind Ryunosuke: Ugh...no, I don't think so. None spring to mind, anyway. Iris: Well if you find any, we should definitely try it! Ryunosuke: ...I don't think we're just going to find prints of the crime scene lying around, you know. (But I suppose if we somehow find ourselves with some, it would be worth a go...) Leads back to summation examination Ryunosuke: ...Don't spare any feelings, will you? It's not like there's anyone here who likes stereoscopes... So...why exactly do you think that the defendant is guilty? Juror No. 5: It's quite simple... We haven't been shown a scrap of evidence to suggest that she isn't the culprit. And just as radio waves dash through the skies faster than the eye can see... ...so we should dash to the conclusion of this trial, and stop pandering to in-dit-cision!Juror No. 6: In motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Please tell me you're not Vilen Borshevik... ...the Russian revolutionary. Juror No. 5: Re-Revolutionary?! Juror No. 6: ......... Da. I believe there is such a rumour. Ryunosuke: ...It's just a rumour? Juror No. 6: As you see, I have unfortunate appearance. I look like wicious criminal. Ryunosuke: (...Your words, not mine. Just want to point that out.) Juror No. 6: People call me revolutionary...murderer...autocrat... Juror No. 5: And...which glove fits? Juror No. 6: 'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.' Juror No. 5: ......... Ryunosuke: (Right. That didn't sound staged at all. You'll forgive me for having my doubts.) Juror No. 6: To be treated like wicious criminal all the time... It is wery painful. People do not realise. So I have much sympathies for these brothers. People say they are criminals only because of how they look. Ryunosuke: The Skulkin brothers? Juror No. 6: Da, maybe they went inside pawnbroker's shop. But they have done nothing wrong. That is all what I want to say! Ryunosuke: ...The Skulkin brothers did nothing wrong that night? (Alright, well first of all... ...that's one not-so-little misunderstanding I'll need to clear up straight away.) Tell me something, Iris... Iris: Hm? What is it, Runo? Ryunosuke: The jurors are chosen at random from the inhabitants of London town, aren't they? Iris: Yes! It's amazing, isn't it? Ryunosuke: In that case... ...how is it that there's a Russian tourist sitting among them, who looks for all the world like a revolutionary? Iris: ...I wish I knew.Pit against Juror No. 2's statement (after Juror No. 2 changes her statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself! Juror No.2: Oh my! My statement? Contradictory? Juror No. 6: Contradict... C-o-n... Ryunosuke: Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick. Juror No. 6: ...I do not have stick. I have mouse. Ryunosuke: As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver. Juror No. 2: Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand! Ryunosuke: ...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d... Ryunosuke: ...Sir? Juror No. 6: Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning. Ryunosuke: ...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Forgive me. I did not hear. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 6: ...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker. Ryunosuke: (...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!) Juror No. 6: So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative. Ryunosuke: Yes! That's exactly right! Juror No. 6: Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal! Ryunosuke: ...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced. Juror No. 6: This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?! Ryunosuke: Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so... Juror No. 6: Enough! I trust no one now! Ryunosuke: ...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir. Juror No. 6: I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself! Ryunosuke: I'm afraid that won't be poss- Iris: Yes it is, Runo! Easily! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder! Ryunosuke: Ah... Iris: If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor! Van Zieks: Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight. Iris: So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken. Ryunosuke: (That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.) Juror No. 6: So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing. Ryunosuke: It would seem so, yes. Juror No. 6: Good. Ryunosuke: No, not good. Juror No. 6: You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial. Iris: Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting! Ryunosuke: Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still! Judge: Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence. The post-shooting photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: (Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...) Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.\"Juror No. 6: In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.Ryunosuke: (If I can't change the minds of more than half of these six jurors... ...the trial will be over.)Iris: But we know that Ginny would never shoot anyone.Ryunosuke: Yes, so we need to find contradictions in what these jurors are saying and pit them against each other. (I must be ready to go to whatever lengths I have to... to convince them of Gina's innocence!)Ryunosuke: Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.Juror No. 3: Yes, I see. Tell me, Mr, um...lawyer. Do you know how stereographic images work? Do you understand the principle?Ryunosuke: Well...I think so... (I did have a lesson only yesterday...) The left and right eye images need to be the same, only with a slight shift in the positions of some objects. Then when your brain merges the two images together inside your head, it notices the shift as if it were depth.Juror No. 3: Yes, exactly.Iris: It's that small shift between certain objects in the two pictures that's really important.Ryunosuke: So what happens if you use two photographs that are exactly the same, then?Juror No. 3: No no, obviously that wouldn't work at all. Not for seeing the scene three-dimensionally, anyway.Iris: Oh... OOOOOOH! Of course! Now I see!Juror No. 3: Ah! I think the young girl has discovered the secret!Iris: I have, I have!Ryunosuke: ...Can you uncross your eyes before you tell me?Iris: Have another look at these two pictures from Hurley's camera, Runo! Go on! Can you see that there's a really obvious difference between them?Ryunosuke: Of course there is! There are two people in the first, and no people in the second!Iris: Well yes, you can see that straight away. But now... ...try looking at the pictures in three dimensions!Ryunosuke: Alright, I'll, I'll give it a go. (So, to start with... ...you have to cross your eyes, and then try to make the two pictures overlap exactly.) ........................... (Let's see if by crossing my eyes I can make the quill pens from each picture overlap in the middle...) ........................... (...Wait...)Iris: Well? Did you manage to see it properly, Runo?Not really... Ryunosuke: I'm just not very good at this, that's the trouble. Iris: Oh, don't worry. I have just the thing! I happened to bring with me...a portable stereoscope! Ryunosuke: ......... I know I mentioned this yesterday, but if you've had that contraption with you from the outset... ...you could have saved me staring at Mr Windibank and Gina like I hate them all that time! Iris: And if you remember, I said in reply... ...that it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Anyway, why don't we try using this helpful little aid now? Here goes... Ryunosuke: ........................... (Now, let's see what we've got... ...Wait! Look at that!)  Leads to: \"Agh!\"Yes, I saw it! Leads to: \"Agh!\"Ryunosuke: Agh! What's, what's going on with these two pictures? Some of the things on the counter sort of... They sort of jump out at you!Juror No. 3: Yes yes yes! That's it, you see! That's the other amazing power of stereoscopes!Ryunosuke: O-Other amazing power?!Juror No. 1: Is someone going to explain this...black magic, eh? Why the deuce do some of the things on the counter seem to jump out at you like that, hm?Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you consider the basic principle of the stereoscope, you'll answer your own question.Juror No. 5: Basic principles...of the stereoscope...?Juror No. 3: As I said before... ...if you try to look at two identical pictures using a stereoscope, it won't work at all. It's the slight shift in the positions of certain objects that lets you see pictures three-dimensionally.Ryunosuke: ...In other words... ...even though at first glance it seems the objects on the counter haven't moved at all between the two pictures... ...this shows that actually...there must have been a slight shift in their positions!Iris: Yes, there must have been.Juror No. 1: Now hold fire there, sir! Got a reasonable grasp of this whole cross-eyed business now, I'd say. But why the devil does this shift between the two prints exist in the first place? Well? What's the answer, fellow? Come on, you're the cross-eyed master!Ryunosuke: What? Me? (I haven't the first idea!)Iris: You know, Runo! It's quite simple.Ryunosuke: It, it is?Iris: Just think it through step by step. The first photograph was taken at 1:00 a.m. Then, thirty minutes later...the second photograph was taken. But the position of some items on the counter appears to have shifted slightly in the interim. So that means...?Ryunosuke: That means that sometime in the half hour interval... ...someone must have tampered with the things on the counter!Juror No. 1: Zookers!Juror No. 3: Someone tampered...?Juror No. 5: New information! Stop. Not mentioned in testimony so far! Stop.Ryunosuke: (Yes... ...we've had to go around in circles a little here, it seems... ...but I'm starting to see what I should be aiming at in this summation examination now.) Ladies and gentlemen! The question now is clear. We know the items on the countertop were moved. ...But by whom?Juror No. 1: Are you... Are you suggesting you might know?Ryunosuke: Of course. I can tell you right now who is responsible for the almost imperceptible shift in the items on the counter!Present Nash Skulkin or Ringo Skulkin profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Quite clearly it was the work...of this meddler! Judge: Hm... I'm afraid you've digressed there, Counsel. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: It should now be clear even to you... ...who is responsible for the impeachable shift in the direction of this trial...toward the absurd. Ryunosuke: Let me guess... ...Me? Van Zieks: Shift aside, my Nipponese friend, and let the real lawyers do the talking! Ryunosuke: Uargh! (I really felt that one...) Iris: If you think about it... ...it has to have been someone who was in Windibank's when everything was going on, doesn't it? Ryunosuke: Well...yes, that's true. Iris: So... ...that narrows it down quite a lot, I think. Ryunosuke: I'll have another think! (We know somebody must have touched the things on Mr Windibank's counter. So who was it?) Leads back to: \"Ladies and gentlemen!\"Ryunosuke: It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!Juror No. 2: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Juror No. 6: Wait! This does not agree with what brothers said in testimony before. They said they did not even have time to pull 'dukes' from 'Lucy Lockets'. My phrasebook says 'dukes' is meaning 'hands' and 'Lucy Lockets' is meaning 'pockets'. But is this...another lie?! Is this what you are saying?!Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm afraid so.Juror No. 4: Now hold on there a minute! You can't be sure of that.Juror No. 2: I quite agree. The accused is a common pickpurse, after all. It's perfectly possible that she went through the things on the desk to see what she might steal.Ryunosuke: I think...that's unlikely.Juror No. 1: And why, exactly?Ryunosuke: ...As you can see from...this photographic print, the defendant was pointing a gun at the victim. It would seem, as my learned friend indicated, that she was coercing Mr Windibank to open the storeroom door. In other words, Miss Lestrade's interests lay within the storeroom, not in the main shop... ...giving her no reason to touch anything on the counter. All of which points to one thing! The Skulkin brothers have omitted key facts in their testimony!Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...! But the accused is a pickpurse! Common gutter trash! Why look any further for the wrongdoer here?Ryunosuke: Because the Skulkin brothers are thieves, madam. No better - in fact worse - than a pickpurse.Juror No. 2: ...!Ryunosuke: I believe that these brothers were looking for something on the victim's counter that night.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Ryunosuke: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you would condemn the defendant on the grounds that she's a pickpocket... ...would it not at least be right and proper to thoroughly scrutinise testimony given against her by two thieves?Juror No. 4: ...Well said.Ryunosuke: ...!Juror No. 4: I for one would like to hear more from that shady pair!Juror No. 3: Can you all see now? I think you'll find stereoscopes aren't playthings! You've seen their extraordinary potential firsthand!Juror No. 5: Wholeheartedly agree! Stop. Must purchase after trial. Stop. Will return home via Regent Street. Stop.Judge: Well...it would seem this trial has yet to run its course. The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have declared their inclinations via the mighty Scales of Justice. I hereby call this summation examination to conclusion with the balance altered in the defendant's favour. Two lean to guilty. Four lean to not guilty. Accordingly, the jury is without consensus... ...and I order this trial to continue.Iris: Yay! Well done! ...Oh, by the way...Ryunosuke: What?Iris: You should hold onto this, Runo. You never know when it might come in useful!Ryunosuke: (Twice in one trial would be unusual, surely? But alright.)The stereoscope has been entered into the Court Record.Judge: Lord van Zieks... ...you will instruct the witnesses that the court demands additional testimony from them.Examine evidence Stereoscope Print tray Iris: You have to pop your two prints in here to start with, you see. Ryunosuke: And then, when you look through the eyepieces, you can see the image in three dimensions! Iris: The important thing to get right is the position of the two prints. Ryunosuke: (I don't know who came up with the idea of a stereoscope, but it's really quite fascinating.) Button Ryunosuke: Ooh! Look at that! It's totally changed shape, just from one little button press! Iris: Well, that is what the button's for, Runo. You're just like Hurley. You boys love pressing buttons, don't you, especially if you don't know what they do! Ryunosuke: (Us boys? ...Says the ten-year-old girl.) Iris: Anyway, now you can see that it really is a stereoscope, can't you?Van Zieks: ......... I'm sure it won't spoil the bouquet to do so...My Lord.Ryunosuke: (I've won myself another chance to probe that pair about their activities that night at least. And I won't stop probing them until I've proven that Gina is innocent!)To be continued...Judge: Order, please. Let us resume proceedings. Witnesses! You will now retake the stand.Judge: I presume you heard the defence counsel's summation examination?Nash: Oh...yeah...guvnor.Ringo: I did, guv, I did.Ryunosuke: ...Mr and Mr Skulkin!Cor!Blimey!Ryunosuke: (...This is going to be hard work.) Earlier in this trial, you gave the following testimony about your actions after you entered Windibank's...Nash: Well it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: However...that was a lie! You brothers!Cor!Blimey!Ryunosuke: On the night in question... ...you rifled through the items on the victim's counter!We never done nuffin' o' the sort!'Ow d'you figure that out?.........Judge: You will now give formal testimony once again. You will tell the court precisely what happened on the night in question. And this time...you will tell the truth.Van Zieks: ...Each lie that passes your lips serves to increase the severity of your punishment. And that, gentlemen, may deal a crushing blow to your chances of ever seeing the light of day again....!...!Van Zieks: A thought worth pondering perhaps.Say no more, guv! We 'ear ya!We'll blab! We'll speak! We'll peach!Witness Testimony - Illegal Entry: The Whole Truth -Nash: Alright, we did knock a few things over. But we weren't riflin' fer nuffin'!Ringo: It woz when we 'eard the gunshot, see. Made us both jump, an' all that stuff went flyin'.Nash: Lummy, it didn't 'alf gimme a fright! We woz thinkin' the shooter'd come out the door and get us next.Ringo: We stuck everyfin' back where we found it and scarpered...straight into 'im in the black.Nash: We couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?Judge: Hmmm...so you admit to the defence's accusation. You did indeed ransack Mr Windibank's countertop on the night in question.Nash: Err...not ransack, guvnor, no.Ringo: That's right, Nash, that's right. It's...more like we tidied up. Yeah.Van Zieks: .........Ringo: Ugh...sorry.Van Zieks: By their own admission, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery under dubious circumstances. However, they panicked and fled on hearing the gunshot, having first made good their mess.Nash: The way you say it...we 'ardly sound like roughs at all.Ringo: We don't, Nash, we don't. Can't 'e make us sound a bit more...cut-throat?Ryunosuke: (It can't just be coincidence that these men showed up at Windibank's that night. There's more to their testimony than meets the eye.

Sholmes' cry pierced through the thick wall of fog around us. Wisps of vapour flowed over the pistol as I cocked it, and I waited breathlessly in the stillness. The silence lasted for what seemed an eternity until, at last, it appeared. From the shadows of the cloud, an enormous beast sprang out upon us. A hound it was, but not such a hound as any mortal has ever seen. Its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, the whole of its ox-sized body was outlined in white-hot flames. Its rumbling pant and hideous howl... So terrified was I that I began to tremble with fear. 'Look well, Wilson!' Sholmes declared, gazing upon the mystical beast. 'For this! This is the diabolical Hound of the Baskervilles!' Our first two months in London passed by in a flash. In that disconcerting courtroom experience we were first thrown into on the day we arrived in the country... ...and in Soseki-san's terrible ordeal that had followed closely behind, we had emerged victorious. However... ...there then came an abrupt end to our opportunities to appear in court. Which was hardly surprising, of course... ...since I was nothing more than an amateur, an unknown student of law from a faraway land. So life in our little office was very quiet. That is... ...until it was shattered one day, by that fateful telegram... 15th April, 9:13 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy *Knock knock knock* That morning... ...I was woken by the unreserved knocking on the door by the telegram boy. But after he'd gone... ...Susato-san's behaviour became very obviously strange. Ryunosuke: Um...Susato-san? Susato: Yes! Is it time to leave for court already? Let me see... What case is it today? Ryunosuke: I...don't think I'm scheduled to defend anyone at the moment, am I? Susato: Oh! No, of course not. How silly of me. Ryunosuke: But I think Iris said she would make us breakfast this morning. So shall we go down to Mr Sholmes's suite? Susato: Yes! Iris makes the most delicious breakfast food. Ryunosuke: She does, doesn't she? Susato: And once our bellies are full, we can leave for court in fighting fit form! Let me see... What case is it today? Ryunosuke: (Here we go again...) 15th April Sholmes's Suite Iris: Morning, Runo! Morning, Susie! Susato: Good morning, Iris! Ryunosuke: Um...Iris... Iris: What is it, Runo? Ryunosuke: What is that terrible noise? It sounds like a cat being strangled. Iris: Ah, yes... You noticed that, did you? Hurley isn't in the best form this morning, it seems. Sholmes: Hello... Susato: Hello...Mr Sholmes. Ryunosuke: G-Good morning. Sholmes: ......... A good morning to die perhaps... Ryunosuke: ...Has something happened, Mr Sholmes? You look miserable, and...the way you were playing the violin before... Sholmes: Hmph. My analytical mind is dead. Music is dead. The world...is dead. Damn this blanched existence! ...That's all it is, my dear fellow. Nothing of consequence. Susato: I'm afraid I don't understand. Sholmes: Well, Iris? Isn't it time we ate? Some dry toast and insipid coffee for me...if it's not too much trouble. ???: Miaow... Ryunosuke: Oh look, it's Wagahai. Susato: Good morning, boy. Wagahai: Miaow. Ryunosuke: ......... (That must be some sort of tiny door for cats to use. But how did it get there?) Iris: Well then, everyone, time for breakfast! Susato: Oh, wonderful! Let me help you, Iris. Sholmes: Ugh...it would indeed be a fine day to die... Ryunosuke: (Ah, I knew something looked different... Something's missing from Mr Sholmes's desk.) After clearing all Converse options with Herlock Sholmes and Iris Wilson: MIIIAAOWWW! Susato: Oh! What was that? Ryunosuke: Wagahai? *Clatter clatter* *Screeeeeech...* Susato: ......... Sholmes: What was that? Iris: Oh no! Wagahai's tangled up in your violin! Susato: I think he thinks it's a toy! Ryunosuke: No! (What's he doing to it?!) Susato: Oh dear... Mr Sholmes's precious violin... Sholes: ...Why should I care? Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: I shouldn't be surprised... ...if the cat is a more accomplished musician than I now. Susato: ...Mr Sholmes really is in poor spirits, isn't he? Iris: Well anyway, I'll put it back where it lives, shall I, Hurley? Ryunosuke: Out of the cat's reach, if possible. (Maybe we should assess the damage...) After examining \"violin\" and clearing all Converse options with Iris Wilson: Sholmes: Come, Mr Naruhodo! Dilly-dallying will get you nowhere! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: Crunching your toast with that vacant aspect... Fressing your coffee so obtusely... Are you not a little embarrassed by your own conduct, considering the urgency with which we are faced? Susato: We must visit Mr Windibank's brokery at once! That's right, isn't it, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Precisely, Miss Susato. Without a moment's delay! Ryunosuke: But, but I haven't finished my bacon and eggs... Sholmes: My dear fellow! Surely you do not still intend... ...to crunch your bacon with an increasingly vacant aspect? To fress your egg ever more obtusely? Ryunosuke: Alright, alright, say no more! Let's go then. Iris: Don't worry, Runo, I'd be happy to heat it up for you again later. Ryunosuke: Oh, thank you, Iris. (As it happens, I am rather curious to see what a British pawnbroker's looks like.) Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Baker Street 15th April Windibank's Pawnbrokery Ryunosuke: So this...is a British pawnbrokery... Susato: Oh my! There are all sorts of tools and contraptions in here that I've never laid eyes on before! Ryunosuke: (Ah, Susato-san...and that spark of wonder in your eyes. You can't wait to scour the shelves, can you?) I get the impression you enjoy places like this? Susato: Oh yes! I don't know why, but seeing such a lot of things I don't understand is a real thrill for me! Sholmes: My dear fellows...let us not forget why we are here. Susato: Oh! Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: We are calling on matters of business, not pleasure. Ryunosuke: (And clearly Mr Sholmes means business, too, judging from the spark of fury in HIS eyes.) Windibank: Ah, Mr Sholmes, sir! Welcome back! Sholmes: ...Did you hear that brazen welcome? Ryunosuke: Well, yes. We are potential customers, after all. Sholmes: We are disgruntled customers, Mr Naruhodo. And it's time to inform Mr Windibank of our ire. Come! The fight is afoot! After clearing all Converse options: Windibank: Now then, Mr Sholmes, allow me to return your precious violin. Sholmes: Ah, the very thing! Thank you, Mr Windibank. Windibank: Perhaps this might mark the end of the peculiar items you try to pop, hm? Because if anything were to happen to one of them... ...this would be the only answer! Ryunosuke: Um, I really think you ought to stop waving that gun around. Someone could get hurt. Windibank: Fear not! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Windibank: I've only loaded a single bullet, so no one but myself could possibly be harmed! Ryunosuke: (That's...not really what I meant.) Sholmes: Good day to you then, Mr Windibank. Windibank: It's been a pleasure as always, Mr Sholmes! Susato: So, Mr Naruhodo! Now we can explore at last! After examining brown machine on left, shelves, brown machine on right, machine in foreground, and calendar: ???: Wot?! Only tuppence for it? That ain't fair, and you know it! ???: That article is barely worth a penny, miss. I cannot offer more. Ryunosuke: (Sounds like there's an argument brewing over by the counter.) ???: Come on, that can't be right! 'Ave you even 'ad a proper butcher's at it? ???: I've seen all I need to see, young girl! Ryunosuke: Wait, don't we know...? (I'm sure I recognise her.) Susato: Oh! Yes! It's the young lady...from Mr McGilded's trial two months ago! McGilded: Her name is Gina Lestrade, My Lord. She's a chancer. Earns her crust among large crowds, relievin' people of their purses. What's commonly called a pickpocket. Gina: ......... Gordon Bennett! You lot! Susato: Hello, Miss Lestrade. I hope you've been well. Gina: Eh?! Wot, you remember me then, do ya? Ryunosuke: Well, I remember being completely surrounded by smoke, that's for sure. Gina: So...wot are you doin' in 'ere? Down and out, like the rest of us? Nuffin' to eat? Come to pop that black weasel - sorry, 'coat' - 'ave ya? Ryunosuke: (...What is it about this black uniform that makes everyone comment on it?) Sholmes: Ah, good day. Unless I'm much mistaken... ...you would be the young pickpocket who stole our experimental smoke grenade launcher. Gina: Agh! Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: So...you have something of value to pawn, do you? Allow me to see the article, and I shall negotiate with Mr Windibank on your behalf. Gina: Pull the other one! I don't need no 'elp from some stuck-up dee! Get outta my business! Go on, or I'll make trouble for ya! Sholmes: As you wish, Miss Lestrade. I will happily remove myself from your presence. Ryunosuke: (He's really done it. He's gone.) Windibank: I'm sorry, but as I said, there really is no room for negotiation here. Ryunosuke: (What is that thing he has in his hand? Some kind of metal disk?) Gina: And you! Go on! Leave me alone! Susato: Oh, Miss Lestrade, just pretend we aren't here. We shan't be offended in the slightest. Gina: ......... Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: (Susato-san can really stand her ground when she wants to.) Gina: Wotever... After clearing \"Gina Lestrade\" and \"New article to pawn\" Converse options with Pop Windibank: ???: Out of my way, please! Ryunosuke: (Who's this picture-postcard English gentleman?) ???: Good day to you, ladies. Gentlemen. Gina: Wot's your problem, eh? ???: There is no problem, as long as you remove yourself. I've a matter to discuss with the proprietor. Gina: ...! ???: And if you intend to make a problem of it, I shall see you outside, little girl, for the hiding you deserve. Gina: Look, ain't it obvious? I ain't done talkin' wiv 'im yet. If you think yer such a gent, you should know 'ow to wait in line. ???: ......... Well, you are an impudent little brat, aren't you? ...As well as a pickpocket. Gina: Eh? Who, who are you? 'Ow d'you know who I am? ???: The question is, how do YOU not know who I am? You haven't the courtesy even to remember the faces of your victims, it seems. Gina: ...! Wot?! You mean I...? From you...? ???: Broker! Windibank: Um, yes, sir? ???: I believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemd an article from you, no? Windibank: Yes, yes, erm... ???: The article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once. Susato: Oh my! Gina: Now that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull? ???: Give me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box disks, too. Gina: No! You, you can't 'ave it! You just can't! It's me old man's! Or it was! ...Now it's mine! Susato: Goodness, Mr Naruhodo... ...this is a very awkward situation. Ryunosuke: Yes... I think perhaps we should hear both sides of the story in a little more detail. After clearing all Converse options with Gina Lestrade and \"Eggert Benedict\": Windibank: So, let that be an end to the matter. And thank you for your custom, Mr Eggert Benedict, sir. Benedict: With such reasonable rates of interest...I may even decide to come back. Gina: ......... Tsk! This is why I 'ate grown-ups! Just cos I'm a diver, everyone thinks that makes me a liar. Benedict: And the contents of the coat pockets, if you please, broker. Windibank: But of course, sir. Here is the disk for you. Benedict: ......... Just this one? Windibank: Pardon, sir? Benedict: I was expecting another. Er, that is...I deposited another. Ryunosuke: (Another disk?) Windibank: Oh, um... Oh dear. I regret to inform you, sir, that what was deposited with me was merely the overcoat. The disk happened to be in one of the pockets, but I was completely unaware of it until now. Benedict: So, gutterling... You're hiding more of what's rightfully mine, are you? Gina: Says who, eh? I don't know nuffin' about it! Benedict: ......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style. Gina: Wait a minute! That disk... ...is mine! Benedict: Argh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal! Susato: Oh my! Yes! There's blood on the disk! Ryunosuke: (It's because of all those sharp little bumps! The man must have scratched his finger on them.) Gina: I found it first, alright! I mean! It belonged to me old man! So yer not 'avin' it! ...Oi, you! You take it! Ryunosuke: Me? Gina: If I 'ang onto it, they'll 'ave it off me again. So you keep 'old of it. Ryunosuke: Miss Lestrade, I... (Why is this disk so important to her?) The music box disc has been entered into the Court Record. Benedict: You there! In the black livery! Hand that disk to me at once, please. Gina: No! Don't! He's lyin'! Grown-ups are all liars! Ryunosuke: (Ugh... What do I do now? How am I going to resolve this?) Ryunosuke: Erm...Mr Sholmes... ...what are you examining with such keen interest there? As you enjoy a bar of caramel, I see. Sholmes: ......... So... ...you've found me at last...Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: After that young pickpocket sent me on my way, I was forced to lurk in the shadows. Cruelly ostracised, as the rest of you partook in the jovial atmosphere of fellowship. I had nothing to occupy my mind, but was too ashamed to let society see what my downfall had done to me. So feigning mock interest, I pretended to examine the tedious trinkets in this desolate place. ...Whilst, as you shrewdly observed, gnawing on the only friend I have left: this seven per cent solution of caramel. Pray, do you claim to understand the depths of my despair, Mr Naruhodo? But how could you?! I was so lonely... So desperately lonely... Ryunosuke: Then...why on earth didn't you rejoin the conversation? Things have gone from bad to worse here, you know! Sholmes: Yes...I overheard much of your conversation. Or rather...in my craving for human contact, my ears devoured every word that was uttered! Ryunosuke: ...You really were sad, weren't you? Susato: Poor Mr Sholmes. I feel simply awful for you. Sholmes: It would seem... ...that my inferences are correct. Susato: Oh! ...Surely you're not about to tell us... ...that you've solved the entire case once again?! Sholmes: My dear madam, sometimes I wonder... Were my genius for deduction to be commoditised... ...how much could I pawn it for? Ryunosuke: (It seems Mr Sholmes has had another of his flashes of inspiration. But who knows if it will help to resolve the situation between Miss Lestrade and the mysterious gentleman? What's the right thing to do here...?) Sholmes: Well, Miss Lestrade...it would appear you find yourself in something of a predicament. Gina: Tsk! Where the blue blazes 'ave you been, eh? Sholmes: Pardon? Gina: When a lady's in trouble, a true gent's s'posed to be there to 'elp. Straight away! Not an 'our later! Ryunosuke: (...Harsh.) Benedict: And who, pray tell, are you? Sholmes: ......... Mr Eggert Benedict... ...you have, in my eyes, a veritably encyclopaedic array of curiosities about your person. Nevertheless, there are two immovable conclusions I have drawn. Benedict: I beg your pardon? Sholmes: The first is this: The true reason for your visit to this pawnbrokery today is something you have not yet revealed. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: And the second is this: A considerable crime is in contemplation. One you will orchestrate, with intent to steal a vast sum of money. Well, Mr Benedict? What say you to my deductions? Benedict: How...! Ryunosuke: (He's turned as white as a hard-boiled egg!) Susato: It would seem that once again...Mr Sholmes has made a flawless deduction! Benedict: Just who do you think you are, sir? Sholmes: Ah yes, as I hoped... That is precisely the pained expression I was looking for. So...shall we begin? The time has come for yet another Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! The Great DeductionThe game is afoot! Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Sholmes: First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! The piece of paper in your hand is a 'staff wanted' advertisement from this very shop. Yet even the most unobservant would soon realise that a man of your appearance has no need of such employ. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction. Benedict: What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years! Sholmes: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. The end of any walking cane would be terminated with a metal ferrule to protect the wooden tip. And yet detailed analysis shows the wooden tip of this stick to be utterly bare. Therefore...there is only one conclusion: The rod that you hold in your hand, which appears to be a walking cane... ...is in fact no cane at all! Benedict: ...! Sholmes: You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong? Benedict: I... Well, I... Sholmes: And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear? Benedict: ......... Sholmes: Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. From the moment I saw it, my suspicions were aroused. 'What walking cane demands such a stout handle?' mused I. Benedict: ......... Sholmes: But of course, as I said, this is no walking cane. No, that rod... ...is the broken handle of a shovel! Benedict: Wha...? Are you insane?! Sholmes: And now, having determined this undeniable truth, the conclusion is clear. Your true motive for coming here... ...was to take employment at this establishment in order to excavate the ground beneath the premises! What a calculated crime you have conceived, sir. A wickedly calculated crime. Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery Topic 2 Great Crime Sholmes: Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning. Benedict: This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, intend to excavate the ground beneath this pawnbrokery with a broken shovel? What on earth do you propose I could expect to find there? Some long-forgotten treasure, I suppose? Save for such a fanciful theory, what possible reason could I have to do as you say? Sholmes: Oh, but there is ample reason... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped. Benedict: What? Sholmes: Let us consider what would motivate a man to infiltrate a shop such as this and covertly dig beneath its floor... The answer is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. This letter gives notice of public works to be carried out in the local area. And according to the enclosed plan of the upcoming sewerage works... ...beneath this shop runs a sewer that adjoins another, one that runs under the bank on the opposite side of the road. Benedict: This madness has entered the sewers now, has it?! Sholmes: By excavating the ground beneath our feet, you would gain access to the waterway... ...that flows in very close proximity to the great vault of the financial institution opposite. Benedict: What are you...? Sholmes: In summary, sir... ...you devised a master plan to pull off an elaborate bank robbery by dint of the underground tunnels! Benedict: M... Master plan?! Sholmes: Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... With what plunder did the thief hope to make off from the underground vault of the bank? Benedict: Are you quite serious? Sholmes: Having consulted with Scotland Yard some days ago, I happen to know the answer. But naturally, the answer is no secret to you, is it, Mr Benedict? Benedict: I have no idea what you're talking about! Sholmes: Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know. Benedict: A postcard of the Great Exhibition? I'm afraid you've quite lost me. Sholmes: Currently in the final stages of preparation, the Great Exhibition will soon be underway. And the government has provided extra funds to complete its centrepiece, the Crystal Tower. Funds that currently sit in the vault of the bank on the other side of this road! Benedict: Pardon? Sholmes: Yes, the considerable crime you have been contemplating... ...is the theft of that which sits in the vault of that bank, the special reserve funds for the Great Exhibition! ...Of course, that is top-secret police information. So keep it under your hat, please. Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this pawnbroking puzzle! Ryunosuke: Um...Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: Well, Mr Naruhodo? An impressively upbeat deduction for a detective racked with loneliness, would you not agree? Ryunosuke: Was it true what you said about the bank over the road and what it has in its vault? Sholmes: Indeed. Though few know of its existence. It is one of the government's most closely guarded secrets. Gregson told me, in the strictest confidence. Susato: But you just announced it to everyone here. Rather loudly, in fact. Sholmes: ...Ah. Ryunosuke: And if it's such a big secret... ...how would Mr Benedict have come to find out about it? Sholmes: There can be but one explanation for that. Clearly it is because the man is a criminal! Susato: But what if he didn't know anything about the money in the vault? If he is a criminal, as you said... ...then buying a brand new shovel is sure to be the first thing he does now that you've revealed the secret. Sholmes: ...Oh. Ryunosuke: Or if he doesn't... ...maybe Mr Windibank will. He already has plenty of shovels here, after all. Windibank: Oh my life! I assure you I'm not so unscrupulous! Sholmes: Hm, well... Hopefully this has taught you a valuable lesson. Sensitive information must be handled with the utmost of care. One can never be sure that someone privy to secrets won't disclose them. And once the word is out, it's out. Ryunosuke: ...Perhaps I'll think twice before confiding in you next time, Mr Sholmes. Sholmes: An excellent idea, Mr Naruhodo. An excellent idea. Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Susato: Well then, Mr Naruhodo, you know what to do, I'm sure. Ryunosuke: Yes. Let's listen to that great deduction again, and see if we can massage it into shape! Sholmes: Very well, then. Let us start once more from the beginning... ...of Herlock Sholmes's magnificent 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! Course CorrectionHold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery Sholmes: First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! Ryunosuke: So, by Mr Sholmes's reasoning... ...Mr Benedict came here in order to apply for a job so he could dig down through the floor. Susato: Yes. In an attempt to tunnel into the sewers to gain access to the money in the vault of the bank across the road. But...he wouldn't get very far with a broken shovel, would he? Ryunosuke: No. I think it's fair to say his motives lie elsewhere. The question is, where? What did bring Mr Benedict here at this particular point in time? Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! Susato: I still don't quite understand why this gentleman came to Mr Windibank's today. Ryunosuke: He might look like a smartly dressed man about town, but perhaps he's destitute really. I really think that's the only explanation! Susato: We must stop thinking along those lines, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Yes...I suppose you're right. Well in that case... ...perhaps there's something in this pawn shop that the man was looking for? Susato: Let's look closely and see if there's anything about his person that gives us a clue. Ryunosuke: Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the info about Miss Lestrade! Sholmes: Quite so, my dear fellow! It would appear that the writing and sketch on the reverse of the flyer... ...pertain to the pickpocket, Miss Lestrade, and to Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery here. Benedict: Ah! Ryunosuke: You originally told us... ...that you had merely given chase after Miss Lestrade stole the redemption ticket from you. Sholmes: But that, sir, is a thinly veiled lie. Ryunosuke: It is the information on the back of the flyer that led you here today. By which I mean... Here, to Windibank's Pawnbrokery, and today, the redemption deadline of that overcoat. Sholmes: So you waited outside for the young girl matching the description you have written down to arrive. Benedict: Hmph! Sholmes: And you have gone to some lengths to hide the reason for your pursuit of Miss Lestrade. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction. Benedict: What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years! Sholmes: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. Ryunosuke: Um...what's a ferrule? Susato: It's the metal cap commonly found on the end of a cane, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Ah, the bit that makes the nice clacking sound on the pavement? Susato: Yes, exactly, And Mr Sholmes is right, it appears to be missing on this cane. Ryunosuke: ...But it doesn't actually look broken, does it? Susato: No, it doesn't. Though the gentleman certainly did recoil when Mr Sholmes identified the cane as suspicious. Ryunosuke: In other words... ...there's some secret about the cane that Mr Benedict would rather we don't know! The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. Ryunosuke: I don't know, I just can't picture it. I mean, a respectable gentleman strolling the streets of London with a shovel in his hand? (I'm sure it's just that the cane is broken and the ferrule was lost somehow.) Susato: Well, there is one thing of which we can be certain in all of this. After all, we saw it with our own eyes. At the mention of his cane, Mr Benedict visibly recoiled. Ryunosuke: ...! (That's very true. So there's definitely something about this cane that's not right...) Ryunosuke: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the initialling. Sholmes: A most astute observation...wouldn't you say, Mr Eggert Benedict? Benedict: ...! Sholmes: We are led to believe, sir, that your initials are 'E. B.'. Yet in a most possessive manner, you have in your grasp a cane bearing the initials 'A. G.'. An incontrovertible contradiction indeed, would you not agree? Benedict: No! You're, you're wrong. This cane isn't- Ryunosuke: You said before that you'd had that cane for years. Benedict: Grrr... Ryunosuke: So don't try to tell us that you just borrowed it from a friend or found it in the park! Sholmes: In short... ...though you hold yourself to be a gentleman, you have withheld your true name! Benedict: ...! Sholmes: You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong? Benedict: I... Well, I... Sholmes: And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear? Benedict: ......... Sholmes: Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Ryunosuke: Let's consider the bare bones of what's happened here: Miss Lestrade redeemed that fine-looking overcoat. And now a mysterious man has appeared, introducing himself with a fake name... ...and claiming that the overcoat belongs to him. Susato: But we know that he actually identified Miss Lestrade from a written description. Which suggests that everything else he's told us is untrue. Ryunosuke: So what we need to do here... ...is somehow prove that the overcoat cannot possibly belong to him! The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Ryunosuke: The man is white all over, but for his overcoat. That's almost reason enough to say it doesn't belong to him, isn't it? Susato: But I'm sure the gentleman's wardrobe isn't exclusively white, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Well mine is exclusively black! Susato: ...I think perhaps we should go shopping together. Ryunosuke: (There's no doubt about it. That black overcoat doesn't suit Mr Benedict at all. But we need a more tangible way of proving it...) Ryunosuke: The split seam, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Benedict: Ah! Sholmes: Yes, because the overcoat is rather obviously a poor fit. Ryunosuke: Having forced it over your broad shoulders, the seam is already breaking apart. Sholmes: My suspicions were aroused from the outset... ...when you so baldly lied about your name and so boldly waylaid this pickpocket. Benedict: Argh! Sholmes: This catalogue of untruths has all been for one very specific purpose: To steal the article that the young girl redeemed from Mr Windibank! Benedict: AAAAAARGH!!! Sholmes: But what really irks me is this: The considerable crime I initially imagined has been considerably curtailed. Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery To abscond with a redeemed item Solved Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds Sholmes: Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning. Benedict: This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, designed a wheeze to filch some tawdry article of pawnage? Have you forgotten that I redeemed the article in the proper manner, using the watchword? Had I not been the one to deposit it in the first place... ...how could I possibly have known the relevant details? N'est-ce pas? Sholmes: Oh, but the watchword can be discovered... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped. Benedict: What? Sholmes: Let us consider how one might come to learn a secret watchword relating to the pawned property of another... The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Susato: The direction of the deduction must change rather dramatically now, I think. Ryunosuke: Yes, no more talk of tunnelling into the sewers. (Which is a pity, because it all sounded rather exciting.) Anyway... ...you can't deny that this mysterious gentleman did know the watchword. Susato: Yes. 'Professor'... If you didn't know that word, Mr Windibank would never allow you to redeem the article. Ryunosuke: Or, looking at it another way... ...if you did know that word, Mr Windibank would allow you to redeem the article whether it was yours or not. (So the question is, could this gentleman have found the watchword out somehow?) The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Ryunosuke: There's no question that Mr Benedict used some wheeze or other to find out the watchword. (Let's think. He only appeared in the shop after Miss Lestrade had redeemed the overcoat...) Susato: He certainly couldn't have overheard Miss Lestrade saying the watchword. So he can only have discovered it from something on this countertop. Ryunosuke: (It sounds like I need to have another look and examine things more closely this time.) Ryunosuke: The method is revealed by the notelet on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Sholmes: Yes, the broker here follows the same procedure whenever a customer comes to redeem an article. He asks the customer for the watchword, and notes down the response uttered on a notelet he has to hand. Then he consults his ledger, and confirms whether or not the watchword matches that of the article in question. Benedict: I would expect nothing less of a diligent pawnbroker. Ryunosuke: But his diligence clearly has its disadvantages. Benedict: What are you talking about? Sholmes: It is increasingly apparent that you were present in this shop before your accusation against Miss Lestrade. Ryunosuke: In all likelihood, you followed her inside, and then observed her talking to Mr Windibank. Sholmes: When the diligent broker made a note of the watchword, as is his common practice... Ryunosuke: ...You observed him writing the word 'Professor' on the notelet beside the ledger. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: And that, sir... ...was the master plan you devised to steal the pawned article from the young Miss Lestrade! Benedict: M... Master plan?! Sholmes: Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... Why would you go to such lengths to redeem that particular article from this pawnbroker? Benedict: Are you quite serious? Sholmes: For an ill-fitting overcoat hardly seems to justify the effort, much less a worthless music box disk. But naturally, you had very good reason to make them yours, didn't you, Mr Benedict? Benedict: I have no idea what you're talking about! Sholmes: Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know. Ryunosuke: The articles we're talking about are the overcoat and the music box disk that was in one of the pockets. Susato: Which according to Mr Windibank, isn't even worth a penny. Ryunosuke: And yet this man went to such lengths to steal them... Why? Susato: I wonder if perhaps... ...we already have the evidence we need to explain it, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: (Could we? Really? I'd better have a thorough look through all the evidence we've collected so far.) Ryunosuke: You see, this music box disk tells us all we need to know. Benedict: What's that...on the back...? Sholmes: It reads, 'For McGilded'... Benedict: Agh! Sholmes: Ah, Mr Magnus McGilded... The unfortunate philanthropist who perished in curious circumstances at the Old Bailey two months ago. A prominent man in London...though his loan-mongering demonstrated a distinct lack of scruples. So...you're an associate of his, are you? Or perhaps a subordinate? Benedict: ......... Ryunosuke: Mr McGilded was a man of unusually small stature. In fact... ...he was precisely the right size for that overcoat that you've squeezed yourself into. Benedict: Ugh! Sholmes: Your true identity remains shrouded in mystery... Mr Eggert Benedict. But the final conclusion here is crystal clear. The reason you came to this pawnbrokery today... ...was to retrieve an article left behind by the late Magnus McGilded! Benedict: Tsk... AAAAAAAAARGH!!! Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds To acquire an item deposited by Mr McGilded Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Sholmes: Well well, Mr Magnus McGilded... Not a name I expected to hear in these circumstances. Benedict: ......... Susato: Mr Sholmes, I'm afraid there's something very troubling on my mind. Sholmes: Pray tell, Miss Susato. Susato: Well, according to what Mr Windibank told us earlier... ...today was the final day on which the coat could have been redeemed, was it not? Windibank: Yes, ma'am, that is correct. Today would be precisely two months since it was first deposited. Ryunosuke: Well, today is 15th April, so...two months ago today... Windibank: ...Would have been 15th February, sir, that's right. It's all carefully recorded in my ledger. Deposited at 10:30 p.m., I see. Ryunosuke: What?! But, but that suggests... Susato: Yes. 15th February... Ryunosuke: ...Is precisely the day on which the omnibus murder took place! Susato: And half past ten in the evening... ...is precisely the time at which the terrible events were unfolding! Sholmes: Suggestive is not the word. It would seem the matter is entirely beyond coincidence. Benedict: ......... You are of course at liberty to make whatever outlandish deductions you choose. However... ...I must insist you hand over the music box disk now. Ryunosuke: ...! Benedict: It would be a terrible shame to return to your native land in a box. Ryunosuke: Agh... (What do I do?!) Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank! Windibank: This is my shop! I can't allow any harm to come to my customers! If that were to happen... ...I should have to take my own life! Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank, no! ???: Alright, that's enough! Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson! Benedict: Inspector...? Gregson: That's right, sunshine. The alarm was raised on one of our dedicated emergency lines. So we got here as fast as we could. Now, what's this all about, eh? Windibank: Oh, praise be! You're here at last! I was moments away from forfeiting my own life in my very own establishment! Benedict: ......... It would seem you have the upper hand. Gregson: Right, you lot have got some explainin' to do! I don't appreciate bein' bothered with some petty argy-bargy! Susato: Petty?! Mr Windibank very nearly met with his end! Gregson: Yeah, with his own gun, as far as I can tell. Windibank: Oh dear... Gregson: And the whole of Britain could meet with its end if I don't get to the bottom of the case I'm s'posed to be workin' on! Ryunosuke: What?! What on earth is the case, Inspector? Sholmes: Spare no detail, Gregson! Gregson: ...I, I might have said a little too much. No matter. It's nothin' to do with you lot. Anyway, sir, you're gonna have to come with me down to the station. Benedict: ......... But of course, Inspector... Gregson: Aah! He's getting away! Get after him, lads! Whistle the beat officer, too!Sir! Gregson: ...There's been a spate of thefts at pawn shops round here recently. So we've fitted emergency buttons underneath the counters for brokers to let us know when there's trouble. Windibank: Oh, Inspector...I was very worried there for a while. Very worried indeed. Gregson: Now then, Mr Permanently-in-Mournin'... Ryunosuke: Oh! ...Yes? Gregson: I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over! Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, of course... Gina: No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine! Gregson: I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now. Ryunosuke: As evidence...? Sholmes: If the police demand something as evidence, my dear fellow, we have no choice but to capitulate. It's all yours, Inspector. Gina: Grrr... Ryunosuke: And so, we handed Mr McGilded's disk over to Inspector Gregson... ...and were summarily turfed out of the shop and onto the street. To be continued... Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy (before initiating Logic and Reasoning Spectacular) 15th April Baker Street Gina: See? That's why I 'ate grown-ups. All they do is feed you a pack o' lies and take stuff away from ya! Sholmes: Oh really, Miss Lestrade? ...Tell me, is that overcoat keeping you warm? Gina: Wot? Susato: Oh my! Surely, you were given that! Gina: Yeah, the dee let me keep it. After I looked daggers at 'im for long enough. 'E went through the pockets and then said, 'Go on, then, 'ave it' before tellin' me to scarper. Always pays off, givin' people a look like you 'ate 'em. Ryunosuke: I can't help feeling that it's going to get you into serious trouble one day... Gina: Wot I really wanted was that nice, shiny disk, mind. Susato: The music box disk? Ryunosuke: But Mr Windibank said it was practically worthless. Gina: I think I'm gonna go and 'ave another bash. Give 'em a long, 'ard stare. Sholmes: I think not, Miss Lestrade. We shan't enter Windibank's again today. Gina: Why not?! That's not fair! Ryunosuke: It can't be helped, I'm afraid. The police are investigating the scene now, and taking a statement from Mr Windibank. Gina: But that disk's mine! I 'ad the ticket for this coat, and it was in this coat's pocket! And there should be somefin' else an' all! That's wot that rotten cove said, ain't it? Ryunosuke: Yes, he did mention something about another article, didn't he? Gina: Well then, that's mine, too! Wotever it is! Ryunosuke: (Now she's really pushing her luck...) Sholmes: Miss Lestrade, I think it's time to admit defeat. You've had your 'haul' for the day. Gina: Yeah! And it's all your fault, Sholmes! Sholmes: So what are your plans now? Will you dine with us this evening? Gina: Eh? Sholmes: Iris would be delighted to cook, I'm sure. And I might entertain you with a modest violin recital. Gina: ......... No, ta. Sholmes: Oh... Gina: Why would I come round your place, eh? 'Ave you lost your 'ead or somefin'?! Susato: Oh dear. She's gone. Sholmes: Hm, having reviled on me quite unnecessarily, I might add. Ryunosuke: I...can't help wondering... ...if perhaps she might turn up anyway. Sholmes: Interesting... Ryunosuke: Once she's had a chance to calm down, I think there's a good chance she'll decide to come. Sholmes: ......... Very well, then. I'll inform Iris to set a place for our potential guest at the dinner table this evening. And one more thing... I should be glad of your company later, too. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: I believe I will have a rather splendid surprise to show you. Susato: Oh, how exciting! What is it? Sholmes: You shall have to wait and see, Miss Susato. ...Until later, then! 15th April, 3:46 p.m. Sholmes's Suite Iris: Ah, Susie! And Runo! Come in, come in! Ryunosuke: Good afternoon, Iris. Susato: Thank you so much for breakfast this morning. Iris: Oh, don't mention it! ...Goodness! Look at the time already! Ryunosuke: Busy as always? Iris: I am! I'm preparing everything for dinner this evening. Ryunosuke: Already? You're obviously cooking something special, are you? Iris: Oh, yes! After all, we have a special guest joining us! Guess who it is! Go on! Hee hee, you'll never guess! Ryunosuke: Um... (Look at those little eyes of hers shining!) Susato: Oh dear. It is awkward when you already know the answer, isn't it? Iris: It's Ginny! Isn't that exciting?! Susato: Oh! Oh...what a surprise! Yes, that's wonderful news! Ryunosuke: (Wow, Iris seems overjoyed at the idea!) Iris: I can't wait to learn some pickpocketing tips from a real professional! Ryunosuke: Oh yes! That does sound like fun! Susato: I'm not sure that's entirely appropriate. Are you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Erm... By the way, Iris, what's Mr Sholmes up to? Iris: Hurley? Oh, he's been like that ever since he got back. Ryunosuke: ...Hellooo! Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: I beg that you won't speak to me. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: I don't know who you are, but kindly take your leave. As you can see, I'm not here. Ryunosuke: ......... (I, I don't know how to respond to that.) Iris: I do apologise. When he gets like this, he's completely oblivious to everything. Ryunosuke: Yes... I see... Iris: Really, he behaves just like a child sometimes, Hurley does. Susato: Mr Sholmes and Iris have something of a parent-and-child relationship, don't they? Ryunosuke: Yes, except that Iris is clearly the parent here... (Come to think of it... ...I wonder where her real parents are.) Iris: What's the matter, Runo? You have ever such a funny look on your face! Ryunosuke: Oh...no...it's nothing. Iris: I know what it is! 'Why does this girl live here with Mr Sholmes?' you're wondering. ...Am I right? Ryunosuke: How?! How did you...? Iris: Heh heh, oh, Runo! I can read you like a book! Ryunosuke: (Ugh... This girl is dangerous...) Iris: Don't worry, you can ask me anything! I won't mind. After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Ah, my dear fellows! How good to see you! Susato: Eek! Mr, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Whyever did you not make your presence known to me before? Ryunosuke: ...Haah. Sholmes: Well, no matter now. So, how the devil are you? Ryunosuke: We've...been with you for most of the day. Sholmes: Goodness, really? Susato: Do tell me, Mr Sholmes, is your violin unscathed? Sholmes: Hm? My violin? Whatever are you talking about, dear madam? Susato: Oh! Um... Sholmes: Never mind that now. I have something far more interesting to show you. Behold, my dear fellows! Susato: Oh, another music box disk. Sholmes: No, not 'another' disk, Miss Susato. This is the one Gregson demanded we hand over as evidence: Mr McGilded's disk! Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: Then, then...what's it doing here?! Sholmes: Heh heh heh! You know, at times, Mr Naruhodo... ...I think that though I have an undeniable turn for detection... ...I may well be even more adept at larceny! Iris: Ooh! That would be wonderfully exciting! I'd be your pickpocketing assistant! And Runo could be our go-to lawyer if we ever got caught! Ryunosuke: Right... Iris: Plus, Susie has such beautiful handwriting, she could write all our menacing crime notifications! Susato: Yes! I'd be delighted! Ryunosuke: (I'm just going to pretend this conversation never happened, I think.) After clearing all Converse options: Iris: Well, it's time I started getting things ready for dinner, I think. Ginny will be here before long. Sholmes: Thank you, Iris. Susato: Oh, well you must let me help you, then. Iris: Of course, Susie! There's plenty to do. Sholmes: I think I shall investigate the condition of my faithful performing partner. Now then...where did I leave it...? Ryunosuke: Let this be a lesson to you, Mr Sholmes: Never leave anything too precious with the pawnbroker. Sholmes: Hm, yes... You may be right. Susato: Oh, that reminds me! Of something Mr Windibank said before. He said that he had a manuscript of Iris's in pawn, didn't he? Sholmes: Did he? Ryunosuke: Yes, he definitely mentioned it. 'Mr Sholmes's latest tale of otherworldly mystery lies dormant in my storeroom,' were his words, I believe. Iris: So you heard about that, did you? I expect you were as incensed as I was! Susato: Oh yes! The idea of such a wonderful story languishing in Mr Windibank's storeroom, gathering dust... Sholmes: My dear madam, I'm quite sure I told you already... ...the pawnbroker's storeroom is the safest place for it. More secure than a bank's vault! Iris: And what about your Stradivarius, Hurley? Was that safe and secure? Sholmes: Weeell... There may be the occasional mix-up. Ryunosuke: (Caused by a certain impetuous someone not too far from me now...) Iris: Do you have any idea how long it took me to write that Baskerville story, Hurley? Susato: Oh, it sounds so exciting! 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'! I should love to read it! Iris: ......... Sholmes: ......... Susato: .........Ah! Ryunosuke: ......... (What's going on here? Why does it feel like an icy chill just swept through the room?) Iris: Susie...what did you just say? Susato: Erm... Iris: You said...'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... But...how could you know the full title? Susato: Well, that's... ......... Ryunosuke: That's because Miss Susato is such a great fan of all the stories about Mr Sholmes, of course. Iris: But Runo, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... ...has never been published. Ryunosuke: What? Iris: When I showed Hurley the manuscript, he told me that I wasn't allowed to publish it yet. Ryunosuke: I don't understand... Iris: That's why he said that he'd keep it safe. Until it was the right time for the story to be made public, you see. Ryunosuke: So that's why the manuscript is at Windibank's...? Iris: And yet, how could Susie here know its title? Well Hurley? What's going on? Sholmes: ......... ...Ah! Ryunosuke: ...? What is it, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: It would appear our guest has arrived. Ryunosuke: Miss Lestrade! Gina: ......... ...This was a bad idea. I knew I weren't welcome. I'm goin'! Ryunosuke: No! Wait! ...Miss Lestrade! We've all been eagerly awaiting your arrival. ...Haven't we, Iris? Iris: ......... Oh yes! Just wait there, Ginny. We'll have everything ready in a jiffy! Come along, Susie! Susato: Right! Of course! It's a pleasure to see you here, Miss Lestrade. Please, make yourself at home! Sholmes: Don't stand in the doorway, my dear girl. Come along in! What say you to some Mendelssohn? I won't take 'no' for an answer! Ryunosuke: ...Meddlesome it is, then. Gina: ......... Wagahai: ...Miaow. Ryunosuke: That evening... ...Iris prepared us all a meal that was even more delicious than usual... ...Mr Sholmes's violin performance was in no way meddlesome... ...and Gina, as we came to call her, taught us all how to steal things from one another without being noticed. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves...well into the night. 15th April, 9:34 p.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Ryunosuke: That was a very enjoyable evening, wasn't it? Susato: Oh yes! Iris's cooking was truly divine! Ryunosuke: And I feel as though I can still hear the enchanting strains of Mr Sholmes's violin even now. Susato: Best of all...I bet I could steal the glasses from His Lordship's face next time we're in court! ......... Naruhodo-san...could I consult with you about something, I wonder? Ryunosuke: What's the matter, Susato-san? Susato: ......... It's...about the telegram I received. Ryunosuke: Ah... (The one that arrived first thing this morning, I suppose.) Susato: ......... I've...I've been summoned. Ryunosuke: What?! Summoned? ...What do you mean? Susato: The telegram was from the Lord Chief Justice's office. Lord Stronghart has asked to see me. Ryunosuke: The Lord Chief Justice? ...When? Susato: Tomorrow morning. Ryunosuke: What?! Then, then we have to start preparing at once! Susato: Oh! No...that won't be necessary, Naruhodo-san. I've been summoned alone. Ryunosuke: Alone? What on earth for? Susato: ......... I have no idea. I suppose I shall find out tomorrow. Ryunosuke: (What's all this about? Whatever it is, it's making me feel very uneasy...) *Knock knock* Ryunosuke: (Oh, who could that be, I wonder?) Iris: Good evening, friends! Ryunosuke: Ah, Iris. Hello again. Gina: ......... Susato: And Gina, too. Iris: Yes! Ginny's going to stay with us tonight. She's going to sleep in with me! ...Isn't that right, Ginny? Gina: Well...yeah... Susato: How lovely! Let me make a pot of tea. Iris: You know, I've learnt so much today! Susato: Oh, what...in particular? Iris: All those things Ginny showed us! Wasn't it wonderful? Ryunosuke: Ah, you mean all those pickpocketing techniques? We had fun trying them out on each other, didn't we? Iris: I think I've awakened a natural talent! I could earn a living from it! Ryunosuke: (...You might be getting ahead of yourself a little there.) So...what brings you up to our humble quarters at this late hour? Iris: Well, you see... ...I came to return this. Ryunosuke: Wait, what?! That's, that's mine! Susato: Oh my! However did you...? Iris: I told you, didn't I? I have a natural talent for it! Ryunosuke: (Oh yes, I'd forgotten... ...Iris literally is a child genius.) Iris: So anyway, here...you can have it back. Not that I really understand why you wear it, though. Ryunosuke: Ah. Thank you. Iris: Alright then, good night! Ryunosuke: Yes, good night. Iris: ......... Hm... So this is your office, is it? What do you think, Ginny? Gina: I think I wouldn't fancy me chances wiv a lawyer wot lives in a place like this. Iris: Yes! Me too! Hahahaha! Ryunosuke: (It seems as though Iris here... ...still has something she'd like to talk about.) Susato: I suppose...she probably wants to talk about the manuscript. Ryunosuke: (Yes, I suppose she probably does.) After clearing all Converse options with Iris Wilson and Gina Lestrade: Iris: Oh my goodness! Look at the time! Come along, Ginny, we should go back downstairs. Gina: Yeah...alright. Iris: And please, don't mention any of this to Hurley, will you? Ryunosuke: No...of course not. Good night then, Iris. Good night, Gina. Susato: You must let me make breakfast for you tomorrow morning! I insist! Iris: Oh, yes please! I can't wait, Susie! Good night, then! Ryunosuke: (Iris... It sure is easy to forget, isn't it? Sometimes she speaks just like an adult. But deep down, she's still just a child.) Susato: Well, I think it's time that I turned in for the night, too, Naruhodo-san. Ryunosuke: Dr John H. Wilson... Iris's father... But also... ...the name of the murdered visiting professor at Yumei University. It can't be a mere coincidence... There's something deeper going on... ........................... .................. ......... ???: ...ster Naruhodo... ...Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: (That voice... That's...Mr Sholmes!) What's going on? It's the middle of the night. Sholmes: It's Miss Lestrade... She's gone. Ryunosuke: Gina? Sholmes: She was supposed to be sleeping in Iris's room. But her bed is empty. Ryunosuke: Well...she's an independent young woman. She probably decided to go home, no? Sholmes: I think not. From speaking to her before she retired... ...I received the distinct impression that she was looking forward to breakfasting with Miss Susato. No, I don't believe the girl has gone home. But I've been waiting for over an hour now. Ryunosuke: Over an hour? Oh... Sholmes: If you'll indulge me, look out of the window, my dear fellow. Ryunosuke: (What's this about?) ...! Wait a minute... (Why is there a light on at this time of night?) Sholmes: That's Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery. Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank's... (Oh no!) Gina: It's simple! If that story was really in old Windibank's storeroom... ...there's no way someone from 'alf way around the world - in other words, you - could know about it. Gina: Sorry, Iris, but if you ask me, 'e's sold it. Wivout tellin' you. Ryunosuke: (Could Gina have gone...?) Sholmes: It seems you have some knowledge of the situation, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? ...Oh, no! No, not really. Sholmes: Well anyway, we must investigate. ???: At once! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! 16th April, 1:14 a.m. Baker Street Ryunosuke: The door to Windibank's... It's open! Susato: And the lamp is burning. Ryunosuke: It must be Gina...mustn't it? Sholmes: Let us hope it's nothing more sinister. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: Come, there's not a moment to lose! Clearly something is afoot inside! Ryunosuke: ...There's no one here... Sholmes: ...Oh yes... ...there is! *BANG!* Susato: AAAAAAAH!!! Mr Sholmes! Mr Shooolmes!!! Ryunosuke: What the- (Has Sholmes been shot?!) Sholmes: Leave me, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: But... Sholmes: After them! Go! Ryunosuke: Right! Ryunosuke: ...Blast! (I've lost them!) ???: 'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere? Bobby: The alarm was just raised from this pawnbroker's sir. Would you know somethin' about that? Ryunosuke: Officer! Come with me! It's my friend! Mr Sholmes! He's been shot! Bobby: Shot?! Ryunosuke: With the policeman close behind me, I ran back to Windibank's... Anime cutscene Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! Susato: Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: How bad is it? Sholmes: Agh...never mind me. But there's much at stake. Behind that door... In the storeroom! ...Hurry! Ryunosuke: Huh?! It's...it's Gina?! To be continued... *BANG!* AAAAAAAH!!! I'll be alright, Mr Naruhodo! After them! Go! Behind that door. In the storeroom! ...Hurry! It's...it's Gina?! From that moment, Windibank's Pawnbrokery became a crime scene. Everything that followed happened in a whirlwind of activity. The arrival of the police, the preliminary investigation of the scene and the questioning... It was just before dawn before I was allowed back to my lodgings at 221B. 16th April, 6:21 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Ryunosuke: Oh! Iris! Iris: A telegram came. But all it said was, 'Wait at home'. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, we asked one of the policemen to have it sent. It was simply impossible to come back. Iris: When I woke up...I was all alone. Hurley and Ginny were gone. Everyone was gone. What happened, Runo? Ryunosuke: (Poor Iris. She's trembling. She's obviously trying very hard not to let herself get too worried.) ...I'll explain everything that I know. Iris: Something awful has happened, hasn't it? Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, I'm afraid so. After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: I'm afraid I'll need to go out again now, Iris. There's not much I can do at the moment... But I can at least try to find out how Mr Sholmes and Gina are getting on. Iris: I want to go, too. Take me with you, Runo! Ryunosuke: ...! Iris: I can't stand just sitting around here waiting. Ryunosuke: (I'm not sure how I feel about taking a ten-year-old child to the scene of a murder... But I don't want to leave her all alone here, either.) Alright then, Iris. Perhaps you can help me? Iris: Oh yes! I'd love to! Ryunosuke: Gina's at the prison. Mr Sholmes is...probably in his hospital bed. Iris: And don't forget we have to visit the crime scene! We need to conduct a thorough investigation! Ryunosuke: Ah, I can see you're ready for action! (I imagine Iris would appreciate going to the hospital sooner rather than later...) Sholmes's Suite Baker Street 16th April St Synner's Hospital, Ward 3 Iris: Hurley! ...Oh! He's not here! Ryunosuke: No. That's strange... The nurse definitely said he was in the bed by the window, didn't she? Iris: Ooh, I know what's probably happened! Hurley was being a big baby. And the bullet wound wasn't that bad after all so he's been sent home. Ryunosuke: Hm, I'm not so sure about that. Baby or not... ...there's no question that it was a fairly serious injury that Mr Sholmes suffered. Iris: Oh... ???: 'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere? Bobby: This ward is off limits! No visitin'! So what are you doin' in 'ere, eh? Iris: Well, I'll have you know, we're Hurley's next of kin! Bobby: Eh? ...Oh! Well beggin' your pardon then, ma'am. Sir. ...A little lady and a curious Eastern gentleman... The great mystery-solver 'as a mysterious family, eh. Ryunosuke: (...If that's how you see us, um...sure.) Iris: Where is he, Constable? Where's Hurley? Bobby: I believe 'e is currently in the operatin' theatre, ma'am. Undergoin' an extensive operation. Iris: Extensive?! Bobby: It 'as been several 'ours since 'e went in. Iris: Oh dear... Is he going to be alright? Bobby: Well, it doesn't appear to be workin', you see. The anaesthetic, that is. Iris: Oh! Bobby: I 'ave 'eard a report that the gentleman claims 'e may 'ave 'ad a little too much to drink last night. Coffee, that is. Ryunosuke: Haah... Bobby: Anyway, I think it would be fair to assume that 'e won't be back 'ere for several 'ours yet. Ryunosuke: ...I see. Thank you, Constable. Perhaps we should leave and come back later. Iris: Oh, poor Hurley... 16th April Windibank's Pawnbrokery Iris: This is where it happened, then? Last night. Ryunosuke: That's right. The two thugs I told you about were obviously ransacking the place, looking for valuables. Iris: But... ...apart from the policemen in here, you wouldn't know anything had happened. There's no sign of a disturbance. Ryunosuke: No...you're right about that, actually. Iris: In fact, if anyone, it's the police who seem to be the ones doing the ransacking. Ryunosuke: I know what you mean. They're like a gang of organised criminals, all dressed in black! ???: Oi! I heard that! Ryunosuke: Oh, Inspector! Erm... Good morning. Gregson: Hmph. I s'pose I ought to thank you for your vigilance last night. We got to the scene before it was disturbed at least. Shame you let the two rogues get away, mind. Ryunosuke: Yes... I'm sorry about that. Iris: ...I thought you'd assigned extra men to the beat around here, Gregsy. Now look what's happened! Hurley's been injured because there weren't enough police on duty! Gregson: .........Ah! Y...Y...Your Ladyship! No one told me you were comin'! Iris: I expect you to take full responsibility for what happened to Hurley and see he has the very best medical care! Gregson: Of course, Your Ladyship! The very best doctors in the capital are tendin' to him as we speak! Iris: And I don't think it's Runo's fault that the rogues managed to get away, is it? Chasing criminals is the police's job. Gregson: Absolutely, Your Ladyship! As you say, ma'am, as you say! The gent in black is totally blameless! Everyone's in agreement about that. Ryunosuke: (Would you believe it?! He's like a completely different person with Iris. Talk about a personality change...) Gregson: Oh! Where are me manners? Are you thirsty, Your Ladyship? Perhaps you'd like some juice? Some nice, refreshin' fruit juice? Iris: Oh, why? Are you thirsty, Gregsy? I have some of my special herbal tea with me, if you'd like some! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Ta very much. That really hit the spot...Your Ladyship. Ryunosuke: (I don't even recognise him like this...) After clearing all Converse options: Gregson: Oh...yeah...there's somethin' I was s'posed to talk to you about, actually, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Yes? What is it? Gregson: I've got an important message for you. I clean forgot about it until now. Ryunosuke: An important message? (I wonder what it could be...) 16th April British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: (Yes... ...no matter how many times I come here, I always get the same sense of oppressiveness somehow...) Iris: Do you think the place is oppressive? I think it's normal. Ryunosuke: How so?! Iris: I mean, look at that suit of armour over there. You can't take that seriously, can you? Ryunosuke: ...Maybe it thinks the same about you. ???: ...So everything is clear with regard to tomorrow's arrangements, I trust? ???: Yes. Thank you very much. Ryunosuke: (There they are. Susato-san and Lord Stronghart.) Iris: I wonder what they're talking about. They both look very serious. Stronghart: Very good. There is nothing further to discuss. You may return to your lodgings. No doubt you have much to do in preparation for your return to your homeland. Ryunosuke: ......... (...Wait, what did he just say? 'Your return to your homeland'...?) Susato-san! Susato: ...! Oh! Um...Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: ......... What was all that about? Susato: ......... Stronghart: Ah, Mr Naruhodo. Thank you for coming to collect your colleague. Ryunosuke: What's this all about? Why were you talking about Miss Susato's 'return to her homeland'? And, and... ...tomorrow?! Susato: ......... Iris: Tomorrow...? But what about Ginny's trial? Susato: ...! You mean... ...she's been formally charged now? Oh dear... Iris: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Stronghart: ...Three minutes precisely until my next meeting. You must excuse me. Ryunosuke: ......... There's just...one more thing, Lord Stronghart. Stronghart: Which is? Ryunosuke: It's Miss Lestrade's trial... I wonder if you might permit me to defend her? Stronghart: ......... A timely suggestion. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Stronghart: The girl currently has no representation. Iris: But, but that's not fair! Yes, she may be a pickpocket, but she still deserves a fair trial! Stronghart: ...Do not misunderstand me, young lady. The government provides for those too poor to afford representation with a public defender. The accused need only sign the relevant paperwork, and a defence barrister will be assigned to the case. However...the young girl in question has refused that right. Ryunosuke: Why would she do that? Stronghart: A question you would do well to direct at Miss Lestrade. You'll find her at the local prison. Ryunosuke: Yes, thank you. Stronghart: Now then, it's time I was leaving. Good day to you. Ryunosuke: (What a day. Gina charged with murder... Susato-san about to leave...) Susato: ......... Come, Mr Naruhodo. Iris. We must make haste. Iris: But, Susie... ...you're leaving for Japan tomorrow morning, aren't you? Don't you have packing and things to do? Susato: ......... As Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant, my personal circumstances are of no consequence. My sole purpose remains to help you in whatever way I can. Ryunosuke: ...Thank you, Miss Susato. (That's a very pensive look...) Ryunosuke: (If I'm honest, this has completely thrown me off. I'll just have to do what I can...as a lawyer...) 16th April Local Prison, Cell 13 After clearing all Converse options at Local Prison, Cell 13 and Lord Chief Justice's Office: Susato: Gina... ...I wonder if you might hear me out. There's something I'd like to say. Gina: Wot? Susato: I'm sorry to say...that I must reluctantly bid you farewell. Gina: Eh? Farewell? Susato: Tomorrow, I must begin my journey back home. To Japan. ...I fear we may never meet again. Gina: ...! Oh...right... Susato: I've had the pleasure of meeting so many lovely people here in London. I have so many wonderful memories. And yet...as things stand now... ...it will be a glum parting indeed. Poor Iris is so miserable. Iris: Susie... Gina: Well...well...that ain't my business! Susato: Both Iris and Mr Naruhodo believe you to be innocent, Gina. They've put their faith in you. But somehow...you can't find it in your heart to put your faith in them. Gina: Yeah! That's right, I can't! ...Wot of it? Susato: It grieves me greatly to have to say goodbye to my friends when they are so clearly unhappy... ...because of you. Gina: ...! Wot, it's MY fault?! Susato: Yes. So I have one final request, Gina, before our paths never cross again. Right here and now... ...I want you to show both of them that you don't deserve the faith they've invested in you. Gina: Eh?! Susato: Only by doing that... ...will you truly be as alone as you claim to be. Gina: ...! Wot are you talkin' about? Wot d'you expect me to do, eh? Susato: You've told us that everyone lies. So prove it! ...By admitting one of your own untruths. Gina: ......... Iris: What about what you said before, Ginny? You said something about unforgivable lies. Susato: You must tell Mr Naruhodo and Iris the truth now. That is my last request before I leave. My last request as a judicial assistant. Gina: No... I, I can't... Ryunosuke: (Whatever these lies are, they're obviously weighing very heavily on Gina's mind...) Gina, I could be wrong, but... ...is it something to do with what happened two months ago? Something about that trial? The one in which Magnus McGilded was acquitted? Gina: Ah... Ryunosuke: The case of that mysterious murder that took place inside the omnibus... You were called as a witness by the prosecution. Is that what this is about? Gina: ......... Yeah. You're right. Because...in that trial... ...I lied. I lied like you wouldn't believe. Ryunosuke: ......... Will you tell us about it now? Gina: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Gina: ......... I bet yer ready to string me up, eh? I lied...in that big old courtroom. I told some corkers. Ryunosuke: ......... Gina: The thing is, 'e said 'e would make it so we couldn't live in the East End no more. That's wot 'e threatened me wiv. Iris: What a wicked man... Gina: 'E knew everyfin' wot went on in the back slums. 'E knew we 'ad no one to look after us, and we was all just lookin' out for each other, gettin' by together. Susato: So you mean...Mr McGilded would have- Gina: In an 'eartbeat! 'E could've 'ad the lot of us chased out o' there if 'e'd wanted. And then where could we 'ave gone, eh? Nowhere, that's where! So... I didn't 'ave no choice. ......... Ryunosuke: Thank you, Gina, for telling us everything. Gina: But...I'm for it now, eh?! Go on, admit it! You must be livid! Ryunosuke: Well...you can make amends by doing me a simple favour. Gina: ...A favour? Wot? Ryunosuke: Sign the representation papers for tomorrow's trial. Gina: Eh?! Ryunosuke: If you don't actually want me to represent you in court, you can rip it up later. But we need that paperwork or we can't investigate. The police won't let us. Gina: Investigate wot? Ryunosuke: The scene of the incident last night. Mr Sholmes was shot, you see. Gina: You wot?! Iris: Hurley's having a big operation right now, Ginny. Gina: Is it bad?! Is, is 'e gonna be alright? Sholmes is gonna be alright...right? Iris: ......... Ryunosuke: That's why I want to investigate. For Mr Sholmes's sake as much as anything. Gina: ......... Right. So wot yer sayin' is, if I sign that bit o' paper, everyone's 'appy, is that it? Ryunosuke: Something like that. ...Miss Susato? Susato: Yes! Of course! I have the representation papers here. Gina: ......... ...I, I don't need no one to stick up for me, though. No lawyer or nuffin'. Iris: Poor Ginny... She seems so lonely. Gina's representation papers have been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: Well...at least this should mean we can investigate the scene at Windibank's now. Iris: Yes. And perhaps we can come back to visit Ginny when we're done there? Ryunosuke: (I feel like we've finally cracked Gina. She's opened up to us at last. And now I have her representation papers... No one else knows just what a responsibility that is. Anyway, for now it means Inspector Gregson can't stop us investigating at Windibank's. Although something tells me he's not going to be happy about it...) To be continued... 16th April, 1:26 p.m. Windibank's Pawnbrokery Ryunosuke: (Here we are again at the scene of the crime... Now to thrust these representation papers in Gregson's face and see what he makes of them!) Hello again, Inspector. Do you have a minute, please? Gregson: What is it now? You should go home and get some rest. Iris: Here you are, Gregsy! Here are the representation papers! Gregson: .........Your Ladyship! Hooooooooooooooooooooow?! I don't believe it! How the devil did you get that stubborn little ragabash to sign that?! I salute you! That is good work, that is. Iris: I can see you've been very busy here as well. How about some tea? It's a special blend designed to relieve fatigue! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Well, let's see now... Yes... Yes! I hardly feel tired at all! I'm fit as a fiddle, Your Ladyship! Ryunosuke: ...Would it be alright if we investigated the scene of the crime, then? Gregson: Do as you please! You know where it happened. Through that door behind the counter. Ryunosuke: (Yes, the storeroom... That's where I discovered Mr Windibank...and Gina.) Gregson: Right, well...I'll be gettin' back to business then. Ryunosuke: Will you be investigating in the storeroom as well, Inspector? Gregson: If I'm perfectly honest, we need to wrap this up before long. Can't afford to spend too much time on it. But there are so many articles to go through, it's taking forever, even with the lads workin' round the clock. Which is a problem, 'cause there's another case the Yard needs to investigate urgently. Ryunosuke: (That must be what Lord Stronghart meant by 'far more serious matters' before...) Gregson: So what I'm sayin' is, don't get under my feet, sunshine! Susato: Come then! Let us not waste any time! After clearing all Converse options: Iris: So what do you think of these stereoscopic prints then, Runo? Ryunosuke: They're certainly amazing, but it isn't easy to get the knack of viewing them properly. Iris: No, some people find it easier than others. But that's why contraptions like this exist. For people who find it tricky. Susato: Oh! I recognise that. We saw one over there yesterday, didn't we? If I remember correctly, you press this little knob here... ...then set the pair of photographs in this stand at the back and... Ryunosuke: It's still amazing, even though I know roughly how it works now. Iris: Well, London seems to agree with you. Stereoscopes are very popular at the moment. You can find one of these folding contraptions in lots of households in the capital currently. Ryunosuke: But if these little machines are so affordable... ...surely there's no need to go around staring cross-eyed at pictures like you hate them. Iris: ......... But it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Well, I think so, in any case. Ryunosuke: (Stereoscopic pictures... I'd never even heard of them until yesterday. We've certainly learnt a lot about them. But I wonder if it's knowledge that I'll ever actually need...) The second white cat photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Iris: Oh! That looks like blood! Ryunosuke: I would say it's from a gloved finger. Almost certainly a glove made of leather. iris: Well don't worry, Runo! You can leave the rest to me! Ryunosuke: Look at that... Iris: Yes, that's a colour we haven't seen before, isn't it? Susato: We simply must add it to the portfolio of blood samples! It could be an important clue. Although...it would be nice to find out whose blood these different colours correspond to at some point. Ryunosuke: ......... (Well, this particular stain of blood...) Iris: Oh! You've had an idea, haven't you? Do you know whose blood this is? Ryunosuke: Yes, I have an idea whose blood it is. Not from the colour it turned, but with a little deduction. Iris: That's right! I think it's clear. Susato: Iris, you know as well? Iris: You first, Runo. Who do you think it belongs to? Ryunosuke: Alright, I believe that this is the blood of... Ryunosuke: ...'Thrice-Fired' Mason...? Iris: You don't sound very sure of yourself, the way you trailed off there. Ryunosuke: Well it was two months ago now, that case. And of course I'd never met the victim. So I'm struggling to remember his name. He was definitely 'Thrice-Fired', though. Susato: The victim...of the omnibus case? Yes, his name was indeed Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason. But that would mean that this bloodstain... ...was left on the ticket two months ago! Ryunosuke: Yes. I think it was. Gina brought this ticket here to Windibank's yesterday. I'm suggesting that the bloodstain was already on it at that time. Iris: So it's a smear of blood from the time that Mr Mason was killed two months ago! Susato: Something else is coming back to me now... Mr McGilded was also wearing leather gloves that night. McGilded: Now I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand. Ryunosuke: It certainly does look like a leather-gloved thumbprint, this mark. But we know that Mr McGilded had no injuries at the time, anywhere on his body. From which we can conclude... ...that any blood on the glove...belonged to the victim, Mr Mason! Susato: Mr Naruhodo! You sound just like Mr Sholmes! Ryunosuke: (...Minus the quirky slip-ups, I hope.) Iris: Yes, I think you're right, Runo! Susato: Very well. Let's make a note of this. The details of the pawnbroker's ticket for the coat have been updated in the Court Record. The blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record. 16th April Local Prison, Cell 13 Ryunosuke: Gina doesn't appear to be here. Susato: I believe she must be in questioning at the moment. Iris: Oh, but...wait a minute... Ryunosuke: What is it, Iris? Iris: Well if you examine the scene here carefully, there's another possibility, isn't there? Ginny could have slipped the key from the jailer when he wasn't looking and escaped! Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: Why, why would she do something like that? It would only make her situation worse! Iris: ......... Calm down, Runo! I was only joking of course! Ryunosuke: ......... Oh. Ugh...you had me worried there. I thought it was a 'great deduction'. Susato: Yes, it must be your way with words, Iris. You're so wonderfully persuasive. Perhaps you don't fully understand the weight your words carry. Iris: Oh dear... I'm sorry. I suppose a light-hearted great detective is a contradiction in terms. Ryunosuke: Well, in the same situation, I'm sure Mr Sholmes would just have thrown his head back and guffawed. Susato: I'm not entirely sure that's helpful, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Well anyway, it looks like we won't be able to talk to Gina for a while. We should try to make progress with our investigation in the meantime. Iris: Yes. Come along then, Runo! Come along, Susie! 16th April Windibank's Storeroom Iris: ......... Ryunosuke: (Poor Iris... She's clammed up completely.) Susato: Iris is bound to find this difficult. After all, Mr Windibank's life was taken in this very room only last night. Iris: ......... Gregson: .........Ah! Ryunosuke: Wait! Inspector! Gregson: What is it now, sunshine? Ryunosuke: You took one look at me and tried to run away! Gregson: You think a Scotland Yard inspector would run away from some jumped-up little defence lawyer, do ya? Iris: ......... Gregson: I just! Well... ...I've never seen Her Ladyship lookin' like that before, is the thing. I didn't know what to say to her. Ryunosuke: (So you weren't running away from me...you were running away from a ten-year-old.) Susato: I'm afraid this is all a little much for young Iris. Some gentle reassurance might go a long way perhaps, Inspector. Gregson: Eh?! Iris: ......... Gregson: Erm... Ahem! Don't, um... Don't trouble yourself unduly, Your Ladyship. I mean...at least you're not dead, are you? Ryunosuke: ...I don't think that went very well. Gregson: ......... WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! Look! I'm in the middle of an investigation here, sunshine! And I told you not to get under my feet! Susato: And we have investigating to do ourselves. Ryunosuke: Yes. I'd like to hear more of what the socially inept inspector has to say. Iris: Oh Hurley... Ryunosuke: (And enquire into how Mr Sholmes's operation is going...) After clearing all Converse options, examining calendar, and presenting Pawnbroker's Ticket (Coat) in Windibank's Main Shop, and clearing all Converse options, examining chalk outline, red chest, and revolver in Windibank's Storeroom: *Dong* *Dong* *Dong* Iris: AAAAAAGH!!! I nearly jumped out of my skin there! How could Mr Windibank set such a wicked trap?! Ryunosuke: I...I doubt he set out to scare anyone. Susato: Is that really the time? I think perhaps we should pay Gina another visit soon. Ryunosuke: Oh? Susato: Her trial is tomorrow. We must establish whether or not you will be defending her. I think we should ask her one more time. ...She may have changed her mind. Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: Don't you remember, Runo? You told her she could rip up the representation papers if she didn't want you to be her lawyer. Ryunosuke: ...Really? Did I say that? Yes. You did. Susato: The deadline for submitting the paperwork is fast approaching. Ryunosuke: (In that case, we had better hurry back to the prison and talk to Gina again.) 16th April, 5:41 p.m. Local Prison, Cell 13 Ryunosuke: Ah, Gina, good... You're back. Gina: Ah! ......... Susato: The police must have finished questioning her, then. Iris: Oh, how was it, Ginny? Was it awful? Gina: Eh? Oh... Didn't bother me. Ryunosuke: Thank you for the papers you signed before. It meant we were able to investigate at Windibank's. Gina: Oh...right... ......... Iris: Don't you want to know how we got on? We've been ever so busy. Gina: ......... Wot's the point in askin'? Won't change wot everyone's sayin'. That I did it. Iris: That's not... Gina: ......... Ryunosuke: Gina, we came to ask for your final decision. Gina: Eh? Wot decision? Ryunosuke: About tomorrow's trial. Will you let me defend you or not? Gina: ...! Susato: I must submit the paperwork now if you'd like Mr Naruhodo to represent you. Gina: Right...I see... Ryunosuke: (She's really lost her fight all of a sudden. But I know what that feels like. The worry is just so hard to bear...) Ryunosuke: Those stains on the sleeves of your new coat, Gina... They're blood, aren't they? Not that I know whose blood yet. Gina: WOT?! Susato: B-Blood, Mr Naruhodo?! Ryunosuke: You don't appear to have any obvious wounds yourself, though. So could it be blood that spattered from Mr Windibank when he was shot last night? Iris: Let's not beat around the bush here. This trusty friend of mine will get results much faster than anything else! Gina: Eh?! T-Take it easy, Iris! Iris: Don't move, Ginny! I'm going to shoot! Oh... Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: What the...? Forget the sleeves... Iris: ...The whole coat is covered in blood! Ryunosuke: (Of course! The black colour of the fabric was masking the stains. That's why we haven't seen them until now!) Susato: And the blood has reacted with the chemical to turn a purple colour... ...which matches one of the samples we've already collected perfectly! Iris: Yes, now let's see...who had the purple blood? Aha! Yes, it was the brickmaker, Mr Mason. The victim of the murder case two months ago. Ryunosuke: ......... (I knew it...) Gina: Wot, wot are you all on about? The victim? Wot d'you mean? Susato: ......... It's a rather uncomfortable situation, Mr Naruhodo, but I think this makes things quite clear. It means the omnibus case is finally solved. The truth about who really murdered the brickmaker, Mr Mason...is revealed. Gina: Oi! Would someone explain wot's goin' on?! Stop tellin' 'alf a story! Susato: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Susato: Gina...may I ask you something? Gina: Wot? Susato: I'd just like to make absolutely sure... What would you like us to do with these representation papers for tomorrow's trial? Gina: ......... 'Ow many times do I 'ave to say it? Rip 'em up and chuck 'em away. Susato: Are you really sure that's what you want? Gina: I bet that's wot 'e wants an' all now. Mr 'I'm-a-Believer' Lawyer over there. Ryunosuke: ......... Gina: Don't forget it was me in that trial two months ago. I led everyone up the garden path, didn't I? An' yer tellin' me you can believe in me after that? Not likely. Susato: ......... Well, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: (A lawyer's primary weapon is an unwavering belief in his clients... Ultimately it comes down to whether or not I feel I can trust Gina after everything that's happened...) Ryunosuke: Gina...let me say it again... Please allow me to represent you in tomorrow's trial. Gina: Eh? Are you 'alf-baked? Ryunosuke: Not at all. You've not once admitted to committing the crime, have you? What's more...I believe that you're telling me the truth. Gina: ......... Seriously, um...Mr Narrow-'Oddo... ...didn't you 'ear all of wot I said before? I'm a born liar. Fibs just trip off me tongue. And I'm a diver, don't forget. I pulled the wool over yer eyes two months ago and got you into all sorts o' trouble. Why would you ever trust me now? I just don't get it! Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Gina... Gina: ...! Susato: ...I do understand why you choose not to put your trust in others. But I assure you, there is more to this life than you yet realise. Gina: Wot d'you mean? Susato: The world we live in... ...is full of people you would do very well to trust. People who won't ever let you down. Gina: Eh? Ryunosuke: It's true that I'm just a student of law, and I'm certainly lacking in courtroom experience. But I can promise you this: Whatever happens...and until my very last breath... ...I am completely on your side! Gina: ......... Wot...wot d'you expect me to say to that? ......... Susato: Then it's decided. I will take these papers now and carry out the necessary preparations for tomorrow's trial. It would be a shame to throw them away now after it's been penned with your name so beautifully. Gina: ...Do wot you like. You Eastern lot are...are... I dunno wot you are! I don't get ya! Ryunosuke: (Gina's taken herself off to the back of her cell. She'd never admit it, but I hope she's feeling relieved. That turned out alright in the end...I think.) ........................... Susato: Whoever's hiding there... ...show yourself at once! Eavesdropping is the height of cowardice! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato?! Susato: Somebody is there in the shadows. I can sense it. Somebody who wasn't there before! Ryunosuke: What?! ???: ......... ...Blimey, you're sharp, eh? Gregson: I s'pose you were usin' one of those mystic Japanese arts. Like the art of stealth I've heard so much about. Ryunosuke: ...If anyone was being stealthy, it was you, Inspector. Iris: Gregsy! Gregson: Oh dear me, I am most terribly sorry, Your Ladyship! I didn't mean to startle you! Iris: How long have you been listening in on our conversation? Gregson: Good grief! Listenin' in?! No no no! I just got word that there were some visitors who were refusin' to leave even though it was after hours. I assure you, Your Ladyship, I only just arrived. This very minute! Not a moment earlier! That's all it is! Nothin' untoward! Nothin' at all! Ryunosuke: After hours...? Is it that late already? Gregson: So then, I'll humbly excuse myself now, Your Ladyship. Ta-ta! Toodle-oo! Cheerio! All the best! Bye, by and by! Ryunosuke: (That's a lot of farewells, and not one of them appropriate for 'Her Ladyship'.) Iris: Oh, but I wanted to have a chat! Gregson: I'm, I'm terribly sorry, but time is pressin' at the minute. Iris: Oh, I see. ...That's a shame. Gregson: If I don't get this emergency at the Supreme Court dealt with sharpish, Lord  Stronghart will, well... Iris: Emergency?! Ryunosuke: Lord Stronghart? Gregson: Nothin'! Forget I said anythin'! Anyway...ahem! I'm off! Iris: Alright, Gregsy, if you have to. But let's chat soon! Gregson: Delighted! Charmed! Can't wait! If you please! My pleasure! Ryunosuke: (That's a lot of pleasantries, and not one of them sounded sincere...) Iris: Gregsy's so funny! He says such silly things! Ryunosuke: It's certainly entertaining to see an inspector of the police fawning to a ten-year-old girl. (But anyway, I wonder what this emergency is at the Supreme Court...) Susato: I must attend the court clerk's office now before it closes. Ryunosuke: Yes, of course. Thank you, Miss Susato. Susato: ......... Kindly escort Iris home now, Mr Naruhodo. I shall meet you there later. Ryunosuke: And so our investigation came to an end. Susato-san went to file the necessary papers for my defence of Gina the following day. And then it hit me... I could no longer suppress the wretched feeling that had been gnawing away at my insides. Tomorrow...Susato-san would be leaving. Leaving Britain and making her way back to Japan. 16th April, 11:13 p.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Susato: Naruhodo-san... ...it's been a very trying day, hasn't it? I do hope you're not too exhausted. Ryunosuke: What about you, Susato-san? Today has been even more trying for you, I'm sure. (Mr Sholmes was shot before our eyes, Gina was arrested... ...all on the back of the news that her father has fallen ill and that she must return to Japan at once.) I...hope your father recovers soon. Susato: Thank you for your kind words. ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: I wonder why it is... ...that so many thoughts rage in my head like a storm... ...and yet I seem unable to find the words to express any of them. Ryunosuke: I know exactly what you mean. Susato: Anyway, I have one final task to complete as your judicial assistant. Once that is done, I shall make preparations for my departure tomorrow. Ryunosuke: (One final task...?) After clearing all Converse options: Susato: Well...it's getting rather late. I think you should go to bed now, Naruhodo-san. I must finish packing up my things in my room. Ryunosuke: Susato-san, I... Susato: I wish you the very best of luck tomorrow! ...Good night. Ryunosuke: Wait! There's, there's something I need to say! Susato: Haiiiiii-YA! Ryunosuke: What, what was that...? Susato: A secret technique of mine... The 'Susato Shutdown'. Ryunosuke: Shutdown? Susato: ......... Please...I implore you... If we have to voice our goodbyes... ...I won't be able to hold back my tears. Ryunosuke: ......... Susato-san... It truly had been a trying day. On our feet for hours... Getting Gina to open up to us... And learning the truth about that nemesis of a case. Physically and mentally, I was exhausted. And yet the idea of sleep seemed impossible. But I forced myself to close my eyes... ...eventually...my fatigue triumphed, and I fell into a deep sleep. ...................................................... 17th April, the Small Hours St Synner's Hospital, Ward 3 ???: ...Yes, I quite understand. ???: That is a great weight off my mind. Sholmes: Rest assured, I shall put everything in place, exactly as we have discussed. ???: Thank you so much. It has been an honour and a pleasure to be acquainted with you, Mr Sholmes. Sholmes: On the contrary. The pleasure has been mine. I bid you farewell...and Godspeed... ...my dear madam. To be continued...\nNash: We woz walkin' down Baker Street in the small hours, an' the gaff's door was ajar, see?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The front door of Windibank's was ajar, you say? What time of night was this? Nash: Must've been about one. ...Right, Ringo? Ringo: Yeah, I'd say so. ...Right, Sulky? Gregson: How would I know? The place would've been shut at one in the mornin'. Just like every other shop in town. Nash: Well it woz pitch-black inside, it's true. ...Ain't that right, Ringo? Ringo: I'm not so sure, Nash. I seem to remember a little light burnin' inside. Wot about you, Sulky, me old mucker? Gregson: ...Leave me alone. Ryunosuke: (There definitely was a small lamp burning inside. That's what alerted us to the situation in the first place.) Van Zieks: And when these gentlemen ventured into the open establishment... ...the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, already had the muzzle of her gun trained on the unfortunate victim. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That is pure conjecture! Judge: Hmmm... Van Zieks: Hah, perhaps. But it changes nothing. These brothers inadvertently wandered into the middle of a cold-blooded murder... ...simply because they found the door of the victim's establishment open and ventured inside. Nash: Right! That's wot 'appened!Ringo: It woz like some kinda sign. Beggin' for us to go in, it woz!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What are you trying to suggest? That you had to go in? Nash: Well, God moves in mysterious ways, they say, dun't they, Ringo? Ringo: They do, Nash, they do. Must've been some sort o' providence, I reckon. Ryunosuke: ...God's will often presents itself as the whim of thieves, does it? Nash: It weren't no whim. I'm dead sure o' that. Ringo: It weren't, Nash, it weren't. Like we said at the time... Nash: ...Ya don't just find doors open in the middle o' the night like that. Nah, there's no two ways about it... Ringo: ...It woz a sign that our long-lost bruvver was inside! Iris: They're not very good liars, are they? Ringo: Well...ya can't deny it. It led us to a bloke wot looks just like our bruv! Gregson: ...I said, cut it out. Ryunosuke: (Those chips are getting a chomping today...)Nash: But once we got inside, cor blimey lummy! We 'eard a gunshot from the back room!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A gunshot, you say. Just the one. Are you sure about that? Nash: Yup, just the one, guvnor. I can swear to that. Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. ...Ain't that right, Bruv? Gregson: ...The firearm used belonged to the victim himself. Iris: Yes, Mr Windibank always used to leave his gun lying around on the counter. Ryunosuke: Right. I remember. Gregson: When we examined it, we found the revolver was completely out of rounds. Iris: That makes sense. Mr Windibank always used to say he only ever kept a single bullet loaded. Ryunosuke: (That's true. I remember him saying that as well.) Judge: So we can say with considerable certainty... ...that only a single round was discharged from the firearm used as the murder weapon. Gregson: Yes, My Lord. We can. Van Zieks: And I should remind the court... ...that the firearm in question was discovered in the hand of the accused. Judge: Hmmm... Ryunosuke: (...Wonderful.)Ringo: We went to see wot woz wot, but the door was locked from the inside.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you mean the door between the main shop and the storeroom? Van Zieks: If my learned friend is having difficulty grasping the situation, perhaps a drawing would help. Excluding the shop's entrance from the street, there is only one other door. That of the storeroom. Nash: 'Course there woz only a little oil lamp burnin'. Not much to see by. Ringo: An' the door woz 'idden be'ind a curtain an' all. Ryunosuke: (That's right. When we arrived, the door was mostly obscured by the curtain.) Tell me... ...why exactly did you try to open that door? Ringo: Eh? Ryunosuke: Any normal petty thief would run at the sound of a gunshot, I should think. Nash: Oh, well, erm...your turn to rabbit, Ringo. Ringo: Well, Nash, erm...yeah... ...I s'pose...you'd 'ave to say we ain't 'normal', eh? Van Zieks: Broadly speaking, humans respond in one of two ways on hearing a gunshot or scream: The timid flee, gripped by fear, while the courageous investigate to see if they might help. These gentlemen are of the latter inclination. My learned Nipponese friend, it would seem, is of the former. Ryunosuke: (Alright... Somehow I just proved that I was a coward that night...) Judge: Thank you, Counsels... So, I believe we all understand that the door was locked and could not be opened. Proceed, witnesses...Nash: We never done nuffin', guvnor! We never took nuffin'! We just left after that, nice an' quiet.Press Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"You didn't do or take anything...\"Iris: What do you think about this pair, Runo?Ryunosuke: I think they're lying through their teeth, that's what I think. And I'm going to prove it!Iris: .........Ryunosuke: What is it, Iris?Iris: Weeell...I'm not really sure. There's just something a bit funny...about that prosecutor over there.Ryunosuke: Hm? (Wait, could this... ...could this testimony be some sort of a trap?)Ryunosuke: You didn't do or take anything... Is that your story?Nash: Well it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: So with no time to take your hands out of your pockets, you just left, nice and quietly, you say?Nash: That's right, guvnor. Nuffin' we 'ate more than violence. Peace-lovin' nibblers, we are, not bludgers.Ringo: We are, Nash, we are. Never even pulled me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: ...So, you'd clearly like us to believe...Nash: Eh? Come again...?Ryunosuke: As you fled from the pawnbroker's that night... ...did you not run into anyone else?Nash: Um...Ryunosuke: And...did you not fire a gun at that person?!Ringo: Erm...Judge: Saints alive! They fired a gun, you say?Nash: AAAAAAGH!!! Blimey, guvnor!Ringo: You ain't tellin' us it woz you in the doorway?!Ryunosuke: It was.Ringo: ......... Why the bleedin' Nora...Nash: ...Didn't ya mention that before?!Ryunosuke: You were armed with a gun. And as you fled the scene, you fired that gun... ...at London's greatest detective, Herlock Sholmes!They shot the great Mr Sholmes? I did hear that, actually. There was a rumour he'd been rushed to hospital....The great Sholmes? That's beyond the pale!Van Zieks: On the night in question... ...this pair were arrested by the police within minutes of the discovery of the crime scene. ...Their suspicious countenance rapidly gave them away.Ringo: Hehe...Van Zieks: And when searched... ...a firearm was indeed found in their possession.Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Van Zieks: Furthermore, the barrel shows signs of a shot having been fired from it.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Van Zieks: The prosecution invites His Lordship to examine the firearm recovered from these brothers.Judge: Yes, indeed... Remnants of powder around the muzzle, as you say, Counsel.Juror No. 5: ...!Juror No. 6: ...!Judge: The court will hold this weapon as evidence.The Skulkin brothers' gun has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: Now, my learned Nipponese friend...Examine evidence Skulkin Brothers' Gun Bullet cylinder Ryunosuke: So, there's ammunition still loaded in five of this revolver's six cylinders. Iris: Yes, which tell us that only a single shot has been fired from it. Ryunosuke: Exactly. Iris: The bullet that hit Hurley in fact, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes... It happened almost as soon as we'd walked in through Windibank's door. Iris: ......... I'll make those brothers pay.Ryunosuke: Y-Yes?Van Zieks: Here's to you successfully presenting the evidence.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: For yes, there are the telltale signs of spent powder on this gun, and a single bullet missing from the cylinder... ...but the prosecution demands evidence that it was fired at the scene of the crime under scrutiny in this trial!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Well, I don't need evidence! Because I was there!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ...However, the rest of us in this courtroom were not.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: If the defence fails to provide evidence in support of its rash claim... ...we shall have no choice but to toast your incompetence...and move on.Ryunosuke: (Evidence that these two fired that gun before they left Windibank's that night...)Judge: The court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof. What evidence shows that these witnesses unloaded a firearm in the pawnbroker's shop that night?Present Blood Samples Portfolio Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The evidence...is in this portfolio!\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The evidence...is this! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: My learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"The court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof.\"Ryunosuke: The evidence...is in this portfolio!Judge: What, what on earth have you there, Counsel?Ryunosuke: During the course of our investigations, we discovered a number of bloodstains.Van Zieks: ...Not trusting the police to do the job they're trained to do? How arrogantly Nipponese of you.Ryunosuke: W-Well anyway... ...we analysed all the blood samples we found and recorded the results in this portfolio.Judge: And you claim to have the evidence the court is demanding therein?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord.Judge: No more dallying then, Counsel. Present the pertinent evidence at once! What do you have in your portfolio that proves these witnesses unloaded a firearm at the scene?Present Windibank's Main Shop sample Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"What is that? Explain!\"Present any other sample Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: THIS is the blood sample that proves it! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"No more dallying then, Counsel.\"Judge: What is that? Explain!Ryunosuke: It's a photographic print taken at Windibank's pawnbrokery on the day of the incident.Judge: From the scene of the crime, is it? Is, is that... ...a bullet hole? And if my eyes do not deceive me, it appears the bullet is still lodged there.Ryunosuke: Yes, as Your Lordship noticed... ...the bullet pierced Mr Windibank's calendar. The date shown being the 16th of April - the very day of the pawnbroker's death.Judge: The incident occurred at one hour after midnight. But this indicates that a separate shot had been fired sometime after the calendar had been set to the 16th!Ryunosuke: That's right. And while it isn't irrefutable, the defence believes... ...this is credible evidence that the witnesses did fire a round from their gun in the pawnbroker's that night!Nash: NAAAAAAAAAH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! ...How does the prosecution stand, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: ......... If that is the direction my learned friend wishes to take, the prosecution has no objection.Ryunosuke: What?Van Zieks: But you'll forgive me for flinging my hallowed chalice aside in disgust at the repugnancy it exposes. Yes. On the night in question, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery illegally... ...and like the bold 'baddies' they claim to be, opened fire on the new arrivals before fleeing back onto the street!Nash: EEEEEEH?! Take it easy there, guvnor! Yer gonna land us in the soup!Ringo: We 'ad a deal! You weren't gonna get into them...details. Tell 'im, Sulky! Set the bloke straight!Gregson: ...I have nothin' to add.Ryunosuke: (So he knew, did he? Van Zieks knew their testimony would almost certainly expose the extent of their crimes.)Van Zieks: It would seem now... ...that I owe my learned Nipponese friend a word of gratitude.Ryunosuke: What do you mean?Van Zieks: What I mean...is that you have helpfully confirmed an important fact.Judge: To what fact do you refer, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: As has been established, at the point of their arrest, a single shot had been fired from the brothers' gun. However, if that shot found its target in Mr Sholmes... ...then clearly these witnesses cannot be accused of the fatal shooting of the proprietor and victim.Ryunosuke: Agh!Van Zieks: In other words...these two men... ...have no material connection to the murder of Mr Windibank at all!Ryunosuke: ...! (So that's it...)Nash: That's it! We didn't 'ave nuffin' to do wiv it!Ringo: We didn't, Nash, we didn't! That's wot I reckon!Van Zieks: Your crimes include unlawful entry, intent to steal, perjury and - let us not forget - attempted murder.Gregson: Quite a catalogue, eh, fellas?Nash: Ah...Ringo: We're in for it now, bruv...Van Zieks: Now then... ...let us take a moment to consider the aforementioned 'great detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes. It would seem the man patronised the pawnbroker's in question somewhat regularly.Ryunosuke: (Where's he going with this?)Van Zieks: Mr Sholmes appears to take pleasure in tinkering with eccentric machinery.Iris: 'Eccentric'? Says who?!Ryunosuke: ...Not me. Don't give me that look!Van Zieks: He installed a pair of machines like this one in the victim's shop.Iris: Oh! That's one of Hurley's 'Red-Handed Recorders'!Judge: What is that, Counsel? It has the appearance of a photographic contraption.Van Zieks: As Your Lordship has surmised, it is indeed a camera attached to a small timing device.Ryunosuke: Every half an hour, it automatically photographs the interior of the establishment. The idea being that if a thief were to break in to the shop, he would be caught red-handed.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: The prosecution has obtained the photographs taken by the device on the night in question. As the court will observe, copious identical prints are produced in a quite desultory fashion.Judge: Hmph, rather prodigal, I feel.Van Zieks: In fact there are two such devices in the victim's shop, My Lord. If I may refer the court to the plan of the premises, their respective positions are here...and here.Judge: You say these cameras produce a print every half hour. I'm afraid I fail to see... ...how that would help if the anticipated thief conducted his activities in one of the many thirty-minute intervals.Van Zieks: One can only pray that the would-be criminal lingers, My Lord.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: On the night in question, the witnesses currently in the stand were not caught on camera.Nash: Hehe, that's a bit o' Friar Tuck, eh, bruv?Ringo: Lady Luck luvs a Skulkin!Judge: Witnesses, at what time did your trespassing begin?Nash: Eh? ...Must've been just after one. ...Right, bruv?Ringo: Must've been, Nash, must've been. Yeah, just gone one.Van Zieks: In which case, minutes before these brothers entered the establishment... ...what scene might we expect to see within the shop? Let us examine the evidence...Judge: Good Lord! It's...it's the defendant! Miss Gina Lestrade!Van Zieks: As the court can clearly see... ...the accused is pictured, gun in hand, facing the victim over the shop counter. No doubt coercing the proprietor to open the door to his storeroom.Judge: Quite! One can only too easily imagine the events that unfolded. The court will take this photographic print as evidence, if you please, Counsel.The photograph of Gina has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke: Ugh...Iris: I, I don't believe it! Ginny...Van Zieks: In short... ...the accused is the only person who could possibly have killed Mr Windibank.Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!???:I say, My Lord...Juror No. 1: Wonder if I might put in a word at this point.Judge: Go ahead, Mr Foreman.Juror No. 1: Took a bally bullet to the knee in the Battle of Maiwand, 1880, don't you know. Decorated for it and all that, but forced to retire from service, sadly. 'Course, a medal can never outshine the exploits of chaps like us on the battlefield.Judge: Yes, Mr Foreman, and...? What exactly is your point?Juror No. 1: Carried on the battle after retirement, you see. The battle of daily life, if you like. And here I am now, leading this small squadron. Six men, all good and true. And we'll all go down together, you mark my words! One for all...and all for one!Van Zieks: ...The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have reached agreement, have they? Is that what we are to understand?Judge: Well, Mr Foreman? Is that correct?Juror No. 1: ......... In a manner of speaking...yes. That is the Garrideb Squadron's position, sir!Ryunosuke: What?! No! It's too soon to make a judgement here!Juror No. 1: Status report for the court, men! On the double!Juror No. 2: His Lordship insists on promptitude at all times. And that goes for making decisions, too.Juror No. 3: I think you'll find the truth is as clear as day now! I could reach out and touch it!Juror No. 4: I wouldn't have left it in there. I just wouldn't. But in all honesty, I can't actually remember...Juror No. 5: Situation clear. Stop. No room for doubt. Stop. Truth now undeniable. Stop.Juror No. 6: I am wery sorry for brothers. They are unlucky.Judge: Very well... ...I now call upon each member of the jury to state his or her leaning in this matter. Announce your considered verdicts to the court!Juror No. 1: Guilty!Juror No. 2: Guilty!Juror No. 3: Guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Guilty!Judge: It does indeed appear that the jury is unanimous in its leaning already.Ryunosuke: (That photograph... It must be the definitive evidence that Gregson mentioned!)Iris: But Ginny didn't shoot him!Ryunosuke: No, of course not! My Lord! The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination!Judge: Very well. The court grants permission.Van Zieks: So...you refuse to admit defeat again. How...unsurprising.Judge: We shall proceed immediately with the summation examination. Mr Foreman, are all members of the jury ready?Juror No. 1: Abso-bally-lutely, sir! Always ready for action, my chaps!Judge: ...Very good. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have determined the defendant to be guilty!Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1: All the evidence clearly points the finger of guilt at this young pickpocketienne.Juror No. 2: As a housemaid, I should like to see all filthy eyesores promptly and rigorously eliminated.Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you look at that photograph in stereo, the truth will just pop out.Juror No. 4: If I have left it in there, I should think there'll be repercussions by now...Juror No. 5: Mind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.Juror No. 6: In motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.Judge: Hmmm... The circumstance of the crime and the evidence do indeed implicate the defendant rather comprehensively.Van Zieks: The storeroom, locked from the inside, in which the victim and the accused were discovered alone. And in the accused's hand, the fatal revolver, the firing of which was heard by these witnesses.Juror No. 1: Not to mention this print! Take it from a chap whose [sic] seen action on the battlefield: That young girl's on the verge of pulling the bally trigger!Ryunosuke: (...Thanks a lot, Mr Sholmes.)Iris: Oh dear... Hurley's cameras were supposed to help, not hinder.Judge: I'm afraid I think you have an uphill struggle ahead of you.Ryunosuke: (But Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank. Which means there's more to this situation that we've yet to see.)Iris: Agreed!Judge: You have the floor, Counsel. Proceed with the summation examination!Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1: All the evidence clearly points the finger of guilt at this young pickpocketienne.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You're Mr Natsume's landlord, Mr Garrideb...aren't you? We really must stop meeting like this. Juror No. 1: ......... Ah, you're that lawyer chap. Well, there's a turn-up for the books! Yes, rather a turbulent time we had back then. Ryunosuke: Some extraordinary events took place at your house, that's for sure. Luckily Mr Sholmes and I were able to get to the bottom of it all. Juror No. 1: ...! Ryunosuke: I think we did rather a lot for you, didn't we? Juror No. 1: ......... Ryunosuke: I mean, obviously... ...I wouldn't be suggesting that therefore you should change your leaning to not guilty or anything! Juror No. 1: ......... Hmph. Can't be denied, I suppose. The 'curse of the Garrideb house' was the talk of the town after that business. Lodgers moved out, and I couldn't get a bally soul to take up the tenancies. Ryunosuke: Oh. Juror No. 1: Haven't had the heart to break the news to Joanie yet. Bad enough that the old girl's clapped up. Yes, can't be denied...you did do rather a lot. But not for us, that's for dashed certain. Ryunosuke: I suppose not... Juror No. 1: 'Course... ...there can be no suggestion of that being the reason I'm leaning towards guilty here, obviously. Ryunosuke: (...Obviously. But honestly... ...I really wish he'd pay more attention to the trial, and less to juror number two.)Juror No. 2: As a housemaid, I should like to see all filthy eyesores promptly and rigorously eliminated.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...Polishing the bench, I see...again. Juror No. 2: A maid's work is never done. Not a blemish must remain. Ryunosuke: Um, what exactly do you mean by 'filthy eyesores'? Juror No. 2: On my way to market for His Lordship, I have to pass through the East End. The place is full of beggars, pickpurses and crossmen. The scum of the earth! Ryunosuke: ...A little harsh, perhaps. Juror No. 2: Let me be plain... If it were up to me, all those back slums would be made spick and span or eradicated. At least we have people like the great detective working to achieve these important goals. Ryunosuke: You're referring to Mr Herlock Sholmes? Juror No. 2: That's right. I like to keep abreast of his exploits by reading Randst Magazine in between my duties. He does wonders, cleaning up London's streets. In my opinion, he should be declared an honorary maid of the capital. Ryunosuke: ...Mr Sholmes? ...A maid? Juror No. 2: It's really quite unforgivable... Gutter scum having the audacity to shoot our very greatest detective! Ryunosuke: ......... Minor detail: It was the two brothers in the stand who shot Mr Sholmes, not the defendant. Juror No. 2: A minor detail indeed. They're all gutter scum as far as I'm concerned! Ryunosuke: Weeell...it just might be an idea to get our facts straight anyway... Juror No. 2: ...Yes, alright. I shall amend my statement. Changes Juror No. 2's statement to \"Those brothers are the scum of the earth! They should swing for shooting the great detective!\"Juror No. 2: Those brothers are the scum of the earth! They should swing for shooting the great detective!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I agree with you. The shooting of Mr Sholmes was an unforgivable act. But the purpose of this trial is to determine who shot the pawnbroker, Mr Windibank. Juror No. 2: ...I'm afraid you're splitting hairs, sir. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Juror No. 2: Whether it was the thieves or the pickpurse... ...it was still gutter trash that shot the pawnbroker in the end. Filth that should be cleaned up and eradicated...in my considered opinion. Ryunosuke: (Thanks so much for sharing. ...Changing this maid's mind isn't going to be easy.) Iris: Runo... ...it was one of those two brothers that shot Hurley, wasn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes. Without question. Iris: Well then I'll never forgive them! Ryunosuke: Oh, Iris... Iris: Perhaps we can use this maid's statement to help us somehow, do you think? Ryunosuke: Yes, maybe. Let's listen carefully to what each juror has to say first...Pit against Juror No. 6's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself! Juror No.2: Oh my! My statement? Contradictory? Juror No. 6: Contradict... C-o-n... Ryunosuke: Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick. Juror No. 6: ...I do not have stick. I have mouse. Ryunosuke: As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver. Juror No. 2: Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand! Ryunosuke: ...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d... Ryunosuke: ...Sir? Juror No. 6: Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning. Ryunosuke: ...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Forgive me. I did not hear. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 6: ...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker. Ryunosuke: (...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!) Juror No. 6: So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative. Ryunosuke: Yes! That's exactly right! Juror No. 6: Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal! Ryunosuke: ...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced. Juror No. 6: This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?! Ryunosuke: Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so... Juror No. 6: Enough! I trust no one now! Ryunosuke: ...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir. Juror No. 6: I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself! Ryunosuke: I'm afraid that won't be poss- Iris: Yes it is, Runo! Easily! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder! Ryunosuke: Ah... Iris: If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor! Van Zieks: Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight. Iris: So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken. Ryunosuke: (That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.) Juror No. 6: So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing. Ryunosuke: It would seem so, yes. Juror No. 6: Good. Ryunosuke: No, not good. Juror No. 6: You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial. Iris: Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting! Ryunosuke: Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still! Judge: Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence. The post-shooting photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: (Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...) Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.\"Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you look at that photograph in stereo, the truth will just pop out.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you mean, 'look at the photograph in stereo'? Juror No. 3: Sorry? What? Don't, don't you know? If you look at the photographic print normally... ...it looks as though the pickpocket girl is about to shoot the victim, obviously. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But there's no indication that the defendant ever fired the gun! Juror No. 3: All I'm saying is that if you look at the same print in stereo, it could reveal all sorts of new information. Ryunosuke: ......... By any chance... ...are you a fan of stereoscopes? Juror No. 3: Ooooooh! How did you know?! Ryunosuke: ...Let's call it a lucky guess. Juror No. 3: It never gets old, seeing the two prints merge into one before your eyes! It's extraordinary! It's captivating! It's the height of modernity! Ryunosuke: ...Of course. Juror No. 3: Oh yes! I think you'll find that the stereoscope is here to stay! Giving us new perspectives we could only dream of before, it's the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Ryunosuke: (...If only it could give me a new perspective on this case, I might agree with you.)Juror No. 3: All we'd need is another shot from a slightly different location, and we could see the scene in three dimensions!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Can it really show up new clues, though? Juror No. 3: Don't know unless you try! Ryunosuke: How about this print here? It should do the trick, I think. Present Photograph of Gina or Post-Shooting Photograph Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Alright then, juror number three... ...are you saying you can do this with any two suitable photographic prints? Juror No. 3: Of course I can! Ryunosuke: Very well then...I'd like you to demonstrate. Juror No. 3: I'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all! Present Post-Shooting Photograph or Photograph of Gina (whichever has not been presented yet) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Wait, sorry? What do you mean, one more print? Juror No. 3: Oh dear, oh dear... Don't you have these in the Far East? Don't you know how a stereoscope works? Iris: Runo! Ryunosuke: What? Iris: You need two photographs for a stereoscope, remember? You know, one for the left eye, and one for the right. Ryunosuke: Oh, oh yes. I remember now. But the print we have from the pawnbrokery is just a normal photograph. Juror No. 3: No no no. I think you'll find... ...that the clue is in the name. It's a stereoscope, not a monoscope! You always need two prints! Ryunosuke: (...Thanks for the friendly explanation.) Iris: Hmmm... Well, if we obtain another print at some point later in the trial... ...we can always show it to this young man then. Juror No. 3: Hahaha! Ryunosuke: (I think you'll find...that know-it-all expression is really starting to annoy me.) Judge: Let's get things back on track, shall we, Counsel? Leads back to summation examination Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Ugh...I was wrong. I can't actually think of anything we could use at all. Iris: What? Really? Oh dear, I think maybe I need to have a stereoscopic look at your brain sometime. Ryunosuke: (...What's that supposed to mean?) Leads back to summation examinationJuror No. 4: If I have left it in there, I should think there'll be repercussions by now...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um, what exactly have you been muttering about all this time, sir? You keep talking about having left something somewhere or something like that. Juror No. 4: Ah...so sorry. As you can probably tell, I'm a surgeon. Ryunosuke: A surgeon?! (That totally passed me by...) Juror No. 4: Of course, people conducting surgery in this country aren't considered to be doctors. Oh no! Even though me and my kind are at the forefront of medical science! The real brains in the field! Ryunosuke: So...what is it that you think you've left behind? Juror No. 4: Ah well, that's...a little embarrassing, to be honest. You see I was operating on someone yesterday. Standard thing - went in through the abdomen. But when I'd finished the procedure, I... Well, I couldn't find my scalpel anywhere. Ryunosuke: What?! (Did he...? Surely not!) Juror No. 4: Exactly! 'Surely not!' you say to yourself, don't you? Worrying, isn't it? That's what's been troubling me this whole time. Could I really have left my scalpel inside the fellow's belly? ...No, of course I couldn't! So...there you have it. Like I said, a little embarrassing, really. Ryunosuke: ...That's one way of putting it. The other is manslaughter. Juror No. 4: That's exactly my concern! And seeing as this case appears to be all but sewn up... ...I need to focus on trying to remember exactly what I've sewn up elsewhere! Now...I'm sure I made sure everything was back as it should be. Well, as sure as you can be without being sure. Ryunosuke: (...I'm sure you need to be more sure.)Juror No. 5: Mind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Sorry, 'radio transmission'? What do you mean? Juror No. 5: ...Are you from the Far East? Stop. Ryunosuke: Um, yes. From the Empire of Japan. Juror No. 5: All communication with Far Eastern nations used to take place by mail. Royal Mail steamers take more than a month to complete the journey. Iris: Ah, but now we have the electric telegram. So we can send messages using electrical signals. Thousands of miles of cables have been laid along the ocean beds, connecting the entire world. Ryunosuke: Thousands of miles of cable? ...On the ocean bed? (It makes my head hurt just thinking about it.) Juror No. 5: You are well informed, young lady. Iris: Hehe! Juror No. 5: But cables will soon become a thing of the past. Stop. Ryunosuke: ...And just when I was starting to catch up. Juror No. 5: Radio transmission is the future. Stop. Messages carried over airwaves to four corners of globe. Stop. Excitement growing! Stop. Atmosphere electric! Stop. Ryunosuke: Right... (...Try not to wear out your fingers.) Juror No. 5: Era of wireless telegraphy! Stop. Driving technological revolution! Stop. And people say inventions like the stereoscope are the height of technology! What utter piffle! I can't understand it. I really can't. They're just silly toys! Pursue Juror No. 3 Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Erm, juror number three...sorry to interrupt when you're obviously fuming, but... Juror No. 3: What?! Ryunosuke: Do you perhaps have something to say about juror number five's last remark? ...As if I couldn't guess. Juror No. 3: Oh, you bet I do! Say that again! Go on! I dare you! Juror No. 5: Goodness! Are you talking to me? Ryunosuke: ...I think he just might be, yes. Juror No. 3: You think stereoscopes are just toys, do you? Huh? Juror No. 5: Absolutely. I mean, really! A machine to view photographs in three dimensions? Why on earth would you not just use your eyes to look at the world around you? It's all three-dimensional! Ryunosuke: ...What a great way to appease the man. Juror No. 5: No, I'm sorry. Stereoscopes are of no practical use at all. Juror No. 3: ......... You just don't know! Juror No. 5: Pardon? Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that viewing a photograph through a stereoscope... ...can unlock all sorts of possibilities! I'm obviously going to have to demonstrate! Ryunosuke: What sort of possibilities? Juror No. 3: Well, take a crime scene, for example. If you had a pair of photographs from a crime scene that you could view through a stereoscope... ...it could reveal hidden clues you'd never even noticed before! Ryunosuke: What?! Iris: Have you got any, Runo? Any prints we could look at with a stereoscope? Absolutely! Ryunosuke: How about this print here? It should do the trick, I think. Present Photograph of Gina or Post-Shooting Photograph Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Alright then, juror number three... ...are you saying you can do this with any two suitable photographic prints?

Ryunosuke: (...What's that supposed to mean?) Leads back to summation examination None spring to mind Ryunosuke: Ugh...no, I don't think so. None spring to mind, anyway. Iris: Well if you find any, we should definitely try it! Ryunosuke: ...I don't think we're just going to find prints of the crime scene lying around, you know. (But I suppose if we somehow find ourselves with some, it would be worth a go...) Leads back to summation examination Ryunosuke: ...Don't spare any feelings, will you? It's not like there's anyone here who likes stereoscopes... So...why exactly do you think that the defendant is guilty? Juror No. 5: It's quite simple... We haven't been shown a scrap of evidence to suggest that she isn't the culprit. And just as radio waves dash through the skies faster than the eye can see... ...so we should dash to the conclusion of this trial, and stop pandering to in-dit-cision!Juror No. 6: In motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Please tell me you're not Vilen Borshevik... ...the Russian revolutionary. Juror No. 5: Re-Revolutionary?! Juror No. 6: ......... Da. I believe there is such a rumour. Ryunosuke: ...It's just a rumour? Juror No. 6: As you see, I have unfortunate appearance. I look like wicious criminal. Ryunosuke: (...Your words, not mine. Just want to point that out.) Juror No. 6: People call me revolutionary...murderer...autocrat... Juror No. 5: And...which glove fits? Juror No. 6: 'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.' Juror No. 5: ......... Ryunosuke: (Right. That didn't sound staged at all. You'll forgive me for having my doubts.) Juror No. 6: To be treated like wicious criminal all the time... It is wery painful. People do not realise. So I have much sympathies for these brothers. People say they are criminals only because of how they look. Ryunosuke: The Skulkin brothers? Juror No. 6: Da, maybe they went inside pawnbroker's shop. But they have done nothing wrong. That is all what I want to say! Ryunosuke: ...The Skulkin brothers did nothing wrong that night? (Alright, well first of all... ...that's one not-so-little misunderstanding I'll need to clear up straight away.) Tell me something, Iris... Iris: Hm? What is it, Runo? Ryunosuke: The jurors are chosen at random from the inhabitants of London town, aren't they? Iris: Yes! It's amazing, isn't it? Ryunosuke: In that case... ...how is it that there's a Russian tourist sitting among them, who looks for all the world like a revolutionary? Iris: ...I wish I knew.Pit against Juror No. 2's statement (after Juror No. 2 changes her statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself! Juror No.2: Oh my! My statement? Contradictory? Juror No. 6: Contradict... C-o-n... Ryunosuke: Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick. Juror No. 6: ...I do not have stick. I have mouse. Ryunosuke: As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver. Juror No. 2: Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand! Ryunosuke: ...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Abdomen...

Therefore I say not guilty verdict.Ryunosuke: (If I can't change the minds of more than half of these six jurors... ...the trial will be over.)Iris: But we know that Ginny would never shoot anyone.Ryunosuke: Yes, so we need to find contradictions in what these jurors are saying and pit them against each other. (I must be ready to go to whatever lengths I have to... to convince them of Gina's innocence!)Ryunosuke: Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.Juror No. 3: Yes, I see. Tell me, Mr, um...lawyer. Do you know how stereographic images work? Do you understand the principle?Ryunosuke: Well...I think so... (I did have a lesson only yesterday...) The left and right eye images need to be the same, only with a slight shift in the positions of some objects. Then when your brain merges the two images together inside your head, it notices the shift as if it were depth.Juror No. 3: Yes, exactly.Iris: It's that small shift between certain objects in the two pictures that's really important.Ryunosuke: So what happens if you use two photographs that are exactly the same, then?Juror No. 3: No no, obviously that wouldn't work at all. Not for seeing the scene three-dimensionally, anyway.Iris: Oh... OOOOOOH! Of course! Now I see!Juror No. 3: Ah! I think the young girl has discovered the secret!Iris: I have, I have!Ryunosuke: ...Can you uncross your eyes before you tell me?Iris: Have another look at these two pictures from Hurley's camera, Runo! Go on! Can you see that there's a really obvious difference between them?Ryunosuke: Of course there is! There are two people in the first, and no people in the second!Iris: Well yes, you can see that straight away. But now... ...try looking at the pictures in three dimensions!Ryunosuke: Alright, I'll, I'll give it a go. (So, to start with... ...you have to cross your eyes, and then try to make the two pictures overlap exactly.) ........................... (Let's see if by crossing my eyes I can make the quill pens from each picture overlap in the middle...) ........................... (...Wait...)Iris: Well? Did you manage to see it properly, Runo?Not really... Ryunosuke: I'm just not very good at this, that's the trouble. Iris: Oh, don't worry. I have just the thing! I happened to bring with me...a portable stereoscope! Ryunosuke: ......... I know I mentioned this yesterday, but if you've had that contraption with you from the outset... ...you could have saved me staring at Mr Windibank and Gina like I hate them all that time! Iris: And if you remember, I said in reply... ...that it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Anyway, why don't we try using this helpful little aid now? Here goes... Ryunosuke: ........................... (Now, let's see what we've got... ...Wait! Look at that!)  Leads to: \"Agh!\"Yes, I saw it! Leads to: \"Agh!\"Ryunosuke: Agh! What's, what's going on with these two pictures? Some of the things on the counter sort of... They sort of jump out at you!Juror No. 3: Yes yes yes! That's it, you see! That's the other amazing power of stereoscopes!Ryunosuke: O-Other amazing power?!Juror No. 1: Is someone going to explain this...black magic, eh? Why the deuce do some of the things on the counter seem to jump out at you like that, hm?Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you consider the basic principle of the stereoscope, you'll answer your own question.Juror No. 5: Basic principles...of the stereoscope...?Juror No. 3: As I said before... ...if you try to look at two identical pictures using a stereoscope, it won't work at all. It's the slight shift in the positions of certain objects that lets you see pictures three-dimensionally.Ryunosuke: ...In other words... ...even though at first glance it seems the objects on the counter haven't moved at all between the two pictures... ...this shows that actually...there must have been a slight shift in their positions!Iris: Yes, there must have been.Juror No. 1: Now hold fire there, sir! Got a reasonable grasp of this whole cross-eyed business now, I'd say. But why the devil does this shift between the two prints exist in the first place? Well? What's the answer, fellow? Come on, you're the cross-eyed master!Ryunosuke: What? Me? (I haven't the first idea!)Iris: You know, Runo! It's quite simple.Ryunosuke: It, it is?Iris: Just think it through step by step. The first photograph was taken at 1:00 a.m. Then, thirty minutes later...the second photograph was taken. But the position of some items on the counter appears to have shifted slightly in the interim. So that means...?Ryunosuke: That means that sometime in the half hour interval... ...someone must have tampered with the things on the counter!Juror No. 1: Zookers!Juror No. 3: Someone tampered...?Juror No. 5: New information! Stop. Not mentioned in testimony so far! Stop.Ryunosuke: (Yes... ...we've had to go around in circles a little here, it seems... ...but I'm starting to see what I should be aiming at in this summation examination now.) Ladies and gentlemen! The question now is clear. We know the items on the countertop were moved. ...But by whom?Juror No. 1: Are you... Are you suggesting you might know?Ryunosuke: Of course. I can tell you right now who is responsible for the almost imperceptible shift in the items on the counter!Present Nash Skulkin or Ringo Skulkin profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Quite clearly it was the work...of this meddler! Judge: Hm... I'm afraid you've digressed there, Counsel. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: It should now be clear even to you... ...who is responsible for the impeachable shift in the direction of this trial...toward the absurd. Ryunosuke: Let me guess... ...Me? Van Zieks: Shift aside, my Nipponese friend, and let the real lawyers do the talking! Ryunosuke: Uargh! (I really felt that one...) Iris: If you think about it... ...it has to have been someone who was in Windibank's when everything was going on, doesn't it? Ryunosuke: Well...yes, that's true. Iris: So... ...that narrows it down quite a lot, I think. Ryunosuke: I'll have another think! (We know somebody must have touched the things on Mr Windibank's counter. So who was it?) Leads back to: \"Ladies and gentlemen!\"Ryunosuke: It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!Juror No. 2: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Juror No. 6: Wait! This does not agree with what brothers said in testimony before. They said they did not even have time to pull 'dukes' from 'Lucy Lockets'. My phrasebook says 'dukes' is meaning 'hands' and 'Lucy Lockets' is meaning 'pockets'. But is this...another lie?! Is this what you are saying?!Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm afraid so.Juror No. 4: Now hold on there a minute! You can't be sure of that.Juror No. 2: I quite agree. The accused is a common pickpurse, after all. It's perfectly possible that she went through the things on the desk to see what she might steal.Ryunosuke: I think...that's unlikely.Juror No. 1: And why, exactly?Ryunosuke: ...As you can see from...this photographic print, the defendant was pointing a gun at the victim. It would seem, as my learned friend indicated, that she was coercing Mr Windibank to open the storeroom door. In other words, Miss Lestrade's interests lay within the storeroom, not in the main shop... ...giving her no reason to touch anything on the counter. All of which points to one thing! The Skulkin brothers have omitted key facts in their testimony!Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...! But the accused is a pickpurse! Common gutter trash! Why look any further for the wrongdoer here?Ryunosuke: Because the Skulkin brothers are thieves, madam. No better - in fact worse - than a pickpurse.Juror No. 2: ...!Ryunosuke: I believe that these brothers were looking for something on the victim's counter that night.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Ryunosuke: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you would condemn the defendant on the grounds that she's a pickpocket... ...would it not at least be right and proper to thoroughly scrutinise testimony given against her by two thieves?Juror No. 4: ...Well said.Ryunosuke: ...!Juror No. 4: I for one would like to hear more from that shady pair!Juror No. 3: Can you all see now? I think you'll find stereoscopes aren't playthings! You've seen their extraordinary potential firsthand!Juror No. 5: Wholeheartedly agree! Stop. Must purchase after trial. Stop. Will return home via Regent Street. Stop.Judge: Well...it would seem this trial has yet to run its course. The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have declared their inclinations via the mighty Scales of Justice. I hereby call this summation examination to conclusion with the balance altered in the defendant's favour. Two lean to guilty. Four lean to not guilty. Accordingly, the jury is without consensus... ...and I order this trial to continue.Iris: Yay! Well done! ...Oh, by the way...Ryunosuke: What?Iris: You should hold onto this, Runo. You never know when it might come in useful!Ryunosuke: (Twice in one trial would be unusual, surely? But alright.)The stereoscope has been entered into the Court Record.Judge: Lord van Zieks... ...you will instruct the witnesses that the court demands additional testimony from them.Examine evidence Stereoscope Print tray Iris: You have to pop your two prints in here to start with, you see. Ryunosuke: And then, when you look through the eyepieces, you can see the image in three dimensions! Iris: The important thing to get right is the position of the two prints. Ryunosuke: (I don't know who came up with the idea of a stereoscope, but it's really quite fascinating.) Button Ryunosuke: Ooh! Look at that! It's totally changed shape, just from one little button press! Iris: Well, that is what the button's for, Runo. You're just like Hurley. You boys love pressing buttons, don't you, especially if you don't know what they do! Ryunosuke: (Us boys? ...Says the ten-year-old girl.) Iris: Anyway, now you can see that it really is a stereoscope, can't you?Van Zieks: ......... I'm sure it won't spoil the bouquet to do so...My Lord.Ryunosuke: (I've won myself another chance to probe that pair about their activities that night at least. And I won't stop probing them until I've proven that Gina is innocent!)To be continued...Judge: Order, please. Let us resume proceedings. Witnesses! You will now retake the stand.Judge: I presume you heard the defence counsel's summation examination?Nash: Oh...yeah...guvnor.Ringo: I did, guv, I did.Ryunosuke: ...Mr and Mr Skulkin!Cor!Blimey!Ryunosuke: (...This is going to be hard work.) Earlier in this trial, you gave the following testimony about your actions after you entered Windibank's...Nash: Well it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: However...that was a lie! You brothers!Cor!Blimey!Ryunosuke: On the night in question... ...you rifled through the items on the victim's counter!We never done nuffin' o' the sort!'Ow d'you figure that out?.........Judge: You will now give formal testimony once again. You will tell the court precisely what happened on the night in question. And this time...you will tell the truth.Van Zieks: ...Each lie that passes your lips serves to increase the severity of your punishment. And that, gentlemen, may deal a crushing blow to your chances of ever seeing the light of day again....!...!Van Zieks: A thought worth pondering perhaps.Say no more, guv! We 'ear ya!We'll blab! We'll speak! We'll peach!Witness Testimony - Illegal Entry: The Whole Truth -Nash: Alright, we did knock a few things over. But we weren't riflin' fer nuffin'!Ringo: It woz when we 'eard the gunshot, see. Made us both jump, an' all that stuff went flyin'.Nash: Lummy, it didn't 'alf gimme a fright! We woz thinkin' the shooter'd come out the door and get us next.Ringo: We stuck everyfin' back where we found it and scarpered...straight into 'im in the black.Nash: We couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?Judge: Hmmm...so you admit to the defence's accusation. You did indeed ransack Mr Windibank's countertop on the night in question.Nash: Err...not ransack, guvnor, no.Ringo: That's right, Nash, that's right. It's...more like we tidied up. Yeah.Van Zieks: .........Ringo: Ugh...sorry.Van Zieks: By their own admission, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery under dubious circumstances. However, they panicked and fled on hearing the gunshot, having first made good their mess.Nash: The way you say it...we 'ardly sound like roughs at all.Ringo: We don't, Nash, we don't. Can't 'e make us sound a bit more...cut-throat?Ryunosuke: (It can't just be coincidence that these men showed up at Windibank's that night. There's more to their testimony than meets the eye. I'm sure of it!)Cross-Examination - Illegal Entry: The Whole Truth -Ringo: Alright, so we'd just got inside the gaff and 'eaved a sigh o' relief when the geezer showed 'is mug!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say 'geezer', I presume you mean the victim and proprietor of the shop, Mr Windibank? Ringo: Who else- ...Sorry, I mean, that's right! Nash: We woz keepin' a close eye on the entrance to the gaff, obviously. But we never thought no one woz gonna come outta the back room like that! Ryunosuke: The back room being the pawnbrokery's storeroom? Ringo: Yeah, that must be where 'e popped up from. Only place 'e could've been. Van Zieks: So it would seem the victim was already in the storeroom when these brothers entered the premises. Iris: Which means...Ginny must have been in there at that point as well. Ryunosuke: But that doesn't make sense...does it? If Gina had threatened Mr Windibank into the storeroom with her at gunpoint... ...then why would he have emerged from the same room all alone when the brothers arrived? Iris: Oh, I...don't know... Ryunosuke: Did you see the accused at that time? Ringo: Wot, that moll-tooler? Couldn't tell ya! Nash: No way, cobber! We 'ad bigger fish to fry then! I mean the old geezer just lost it!Nash: 'Gimme that gun!' 'e bellowed, and then 'e flew at us like 'e woz possessed! I thought we'd 'ad it!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You mentioned that Mr Windibank shouted those words in your previous testimony, too. However, you claimed that you heard him yelling them on the other side of the storeroom door. Nash: Oh...um... Hehe. ...Did we? Ryunosuke: But the truth is, he he was shouting those words at you, wasn't he? Nash: Erm...well... Hehe. ...Yeah. Van Zieks: Was the victim - Mr Windibank - wielding a gun at the time? Ringo: Woz 'e ever! Blimey lummy! A great ugly barrel 'e 'ad, pointed straight at me frontispiece! Ryunosuke: So what you're saying is... ...you definitely saw Mr Windibank with the gun at that time. Is that right? Ringo: It is, guv, it is. Spot on. Nash: Then all of a sudden 'e came at us, 'e did! Ringo: It woz bedlam! I didn't know who woz goin' for who! Ryunosuke: ...You were clearly all going for each other. Ringo: Like Nash said, we thought we'd 'ad it. I mean...Ringo: For an old geezer, the bloke woz strong as an ox. 'E chucked me over the counter!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Yes, I noted that you mentioned the counter in your previous testimony, too. Ringo: Well...yeah...'course we did! Nash: 'E knocked over a load o' books, a candlestick and some skull wotnot. Ringo: That got tangled in some marionette, wot knocked over a picture frame, wot knocked them scales on the floor. Ryunosuke: So in fact, it wasn't the sound of the gunshot that shocked you and made you knock those things off the counter? Nash: Well...'big' bruv 'ere went flyin' over that counter like a gunshot, I can tell ya! Then the old geezer pinned 'im! Ringo: 'E did, Nash, 'e did! If you 'adn't been there, the bloke would've flattened me like a bloomin' pancake in seconds! Van Zieks: At the time in question, the alarm was raised at the local police station via a secret cable from the pawnbrokery. There is a button under the counter used to activate it, which was presumably pressed by the victim. Ryunosuke: (That's right... When the brothers fled the scene and back onto the street... ...they ran straight into the arriving police, didn't they?) Iris: Poor Mr Windibank... He did everything he could to protect his shop...Nash: I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Were you intending to shoot Mr Windibank? Nash: Nah nah nah nah! Never! I, I woz just...ya know... Lookin' out fer me bruv, weren't I? 'E woz bein' flattened, don't forget! Ryunosuke: ...By a man whose shop was being burgled, yes. Van Zieks: And then? The man fled into the storeroom when you pointed your gun at him, is that it? Nash: Yeah, that's it. 'E shoved me away, then ran off fru that door an' shut 'imself in! Ryunosuke: ......... (There's something about that last remark... Something that doesn't quite ring true.) Iris: Hm...I wonder why Mr Windibank ran away into the storeroom... Ryunosuke: What? Iris: Well, according to what everyone's saying... ...Ginny was in there waiting for him...with a gun. Ryunosuke: Ah... (Yes, that's right.) Gina allegedly used Mr Windibank's gun to threaten him and force him to open the storeroom door. In which case...how did the gun end up in Mr Windibank's hands again? Iris: I have no idea... But that is strange, isn't it? Ryunosuke: (This little inconsistency could be significant. I should make a mental note of it.) Nash: Look, the point is, me an' me bruv 'ere... Ringo: That's right, Nash, that's right! Me an' me bruv 'ere...Ringo: We never 'ad nuffin' to do wiv killin' 'im! That's all wot 'appened, I swear!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You say you had nothing to do with it? Nash: Nuffin' at all! Ringo: Nuffin', guv, nuffin'! The old geezer went and shut 'imself in the back room, didn't 'e? Nash: Locked, it woz. From the inside. Ringo: We know it woz, cos we tried to open it. Nash: But it's a decent door, that one. Good an' strong. Wouldn't budge an inch! Van Zieks: So in the end, the situation remains unchanged. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Inside the storeroom with the pawnbroker there was only one other person. The sole person  who could possibly have shot the victim: the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade! Ryunosuke: Agh! Judge: Hm... It would indeed appear so. What say you to that, Counsel? Ryunosuke: (I don't know...) Was there anyone else apart from Gina who could possibly have shot Mr Windibank? There's no one else Ryunosuke: (He's right. Gina's the only one. There was no one else in the room!) Iris: With an attitude like that, Runo, it really will be all over. Ryunosuke: (Now a ten-year-old is reading the expression on my face...) Iris: Well, you just don't have that many. Wide-eyed, sweating, smug and happy. That's about it! Ryunosuke: (Surely there's more than that... isn't there?) Iris: Aaanyway...I think you might want to consider some other possibilities here. ...Or rather, I think you have to. Otherwise we won't get anywhere. ...Or rather, YOU won't get anywhere. I'm just here for moral support, remember. Leads back to cross-examination There could have been! Ryunosuke: Mr and Mr Skulkin! Nash: Eh?! Wot? Ringo: Wot's that look for? Ryunosuke: From the moment you admitted that you'd encountered the victim face to face that night... ...the course of this trial changed completely. Nash: It did? Van Zieks: What is your point...my learned friend? Ryunosuke: The question we must answer is who could have shot Mr Windibank. And it is the belief of the defence that the defendant is not the only possible answer at all. Van Zieks: You have my attention. In that case...let us return to this plan of the premises. The victim was killed in the storeroom, which was locked from the inside. Those are the facts. So pray...what other possible answer to the question of who shot the man could there be? Judge: Counsel... ...you must now provide answers to the court in respect of two conundrums. Ryunosuke: Two...My Lord? (...Twice as many chances to be right, maybe?) Judge: Indeed. Namely... ...from what location did the culprit shoot the victim? And furthermore... ...where was the victim at the time? Ryunosuke: ......... Understood, My Lord. Iris: Are you alright, Runo? Ryunosuke: I'm not entirely sure. But there's one thing I am sure about. If I can prove that there's a credible new alternative to what happened... ...it would change Gina's prospects hugely! Van Zieks: So now...time for some clarity. Show the court on this plan the answers to the questions posed by His Lordship. If you believe someone else could have killed the victim, indicate from where that person could have fired the gun! Present anywhere Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence believes that the culprit could have shot the victim from this location here. Van Zieks: ......... And in answer to the second question... Assuming the culprit fired from the location indicated, where was the victim at the time? Present storeroom (after presenting main shop) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The culprit shot the victim from outside the storeroom!\" Present storeroom (after presenting storeroom) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence believes that the victim would have been in this position here. Van Zieks: Van Zieks: What your answers in fact show... ...is that your own position is as absurd as those you have indicated on the plan. Ryunosuke: What are you saying? Judge: What Lord van Zieks is saying, Counsel... ...is that your answers are clearly flawed! Ryunosuke: UWAAAAAAGH! (...I knew it. It's twice as many chances to be wrong.) Iris: So the questions are: from where did the culprit shoot the victim, and where was the victim at the time? Well... ...you have to at least choose a place that's outside the storeroom, don't you? Ryunosuke: Oh... Iris: I mean, if you're saying that someone shot Mr Windibank from inside the storeroom, they'll just say it was Ginny. Ryunosuke: ......... You're right. (What's the best move here? Should I try again, or gather more information first?) Give it a try Ryunosuke: The defence would like to point out the locations again! Van Zieks: Well well, you appear to be a glutton for punishment. Leads back to: \"So now...time for some clarity.\" Leave it Ryunosuke: My Lord, I would like to consider the situation a little more before giving my answers again. Van Zieks: Consider the situation as much as you like. The answers do not exist. Judge: Very well. The court will hear from the witnesses again while you deliberate, Counsel. Leads back to cross-examination Otherwise Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence believes that the victim would have been in this position here. Van Zieks: Van Zieks: What your answers in fact show... ...is that your own position is as absurd as those you have indicated on the plan. Ryunosuke: What are you saying? Judge: What Lord van Zieks is saying, Counsel... ...is that your answers are clearly flawed! Ryunosuke: UWAAAAAAGH! (...I knew it. It's twice as many chances to be wrong.) Iris: So the questions are: from where did the culprit shoot the victim, and where was the victim at the time? Well... ...I don't see why we can't show that someone other than Ginny could have done it in the storeroom, do you? Ryunosuke: Yes, that's the right way of looking at it, I suppose. Someone other than Gina in the storeroom... (What's the best move here? Should I try again, or gather more information first?) Give it a try Ryunosuke: The defence would like to point out the locations again! Van Zieks: Well well, you appear to be a glutton for punishment. Leads back to: \"So now...time for some clarity.\" Leave it Ryunosuke: My Lord, I would like to consider the situation a little more before giving my answers again. Van Zieks: Consider the situation as much as you like. The answers do not exist. Judge: Very well. The court will hear from the witnesses again while you deliberate, Counsel. Leads back to cross-examinationRyunosuke: (So that's all these brothers are willing to reveal this time, is it?)Iris: They're still hiding something, don't you think?Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm sure of it. And not just a minor detail, either.Iris: It was almost certainly because of these two that poor Mr Windibank...well... You can't let them get away with it, Runo!Ryunosuke: I know. (But I get the feeling... ...that there's even less evidence at my disposal this time to prove that they did it.)Iris: We've come so far... Now it's time to finish them off!Ryunosuke: Well, I'll do my best.Ryunosuke: The culprit shot the victim from outside the storeroom!Van Zieks: ......... Continue.Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank died instantly from a bullet wound in his back. Looking at the stain of blood on the storeroom floor, it doesn't appear that the body was moved after death. Which tells us that he was almost certainly shot while he was in the storeroom. However, the crucial point is, where was the shooter when the fatal bullet was fired?Judge: So you are adamant...that the shot was fired from outside the storeroom?Ryunosuke: Well, according to the Skulkin brothers' earlier testimony...Nash: I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!Ryunosuke: If Mr Windibank ran away through the door... ...we have to assume that the door was open at the time.Judge: Ah!Ryunosuke: It was at precisely that moment, when the victim was fleeing for his life... ...that these brothers had the perfect opportunity to shoot the man in the back once he was inside the storeroom!NAAAAAAAAAGH!GAAAAAAAAAGH!Van Zieks: ...!Iris: Come to think of it...do you remember what the prosecutor said at the start of the trial?Van Zieks: Moving on to the findings of Scotland Yard's coroner... His report states that the bullet entered the body on a rising diagonal trajectory.Van Zieks: It means...the victim was likely shot by someone significantly shorter in height than himself.Iris: Poor man... Shot while he was running as fast as he could to safety...Ryunosuke: Ah! Of course! He would have been leaning forward as he was running away. So even if the bullet was fired horizontally, it would still have entered his body on an upward trajectory!Iris: So the culprit isn't necessarily someone shorter than Mr Windibank!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: I'm sure my learned friend can't have forgotten... ...that the storeroom door was found closed, and...locked from the inside. You claim the victim was shot as he fled into the room. Do you also claim his corpse was dexterous enough to turn the key in the lock?Ryunosuke: Agh! But...but... ...what if someone else locked the door? Yes! There is someone else who could have locked the storeroom door!Van Zieks: Is that so?Judge: Very well then, Counsel. Present your hypothesis to the court. In the scenario just described... ...the defence's assertion is that the victim was shot from outside the storeroom. In which case, who shut and locked the storeroom door from the inside?Present Gina Lestrade profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Obviously, the person who locked the door was the only other person inside the storeroom at the time...\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Obviously, that person could only have been... Iris: Just a moment, Runo! Ryunosuke: Hm? What? I'm just about to point dramatically at the prosecution and unveil an amazing revelation! Iris: Sorry, but just before you do, maybe you should take a deep breath and think things through one more time? The storeroom was locked from the inside. So whoever locked it must have been inside, too...don't you think? Ryunosuke: Ah, like Mr Windibank, you mean? Iris: Well yes, except that he was dead. But there's someone else it could have been. Only one other person, really. Ryunosuke: Oh... (Only one other?) Judge: You're out of time, I'm afraid. ...For which you must be penalised. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (There's a time limit?) Judge: Now then, let me pose the question again. Leads back to: \"In the scenario just described...\"Ryunosuke: Obviously, the person who locked the door was the only other person inside the storeroom at the time... ...the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: That's absurd! You're suggesting that the accused deliberately engineered the sealed room? For what possible reason?! Such actions would only serve to tighten the noose around her neck!Judge: I am inclined to agree, I must say. ...Well, Counsel?Ryunosuke: ......... Ah...yes...that's a tricky one, that...isn't it?Judge: Half-baked notions have no place in my courtroom, Counsel. Remember that, please.Iris: But of course Ginny would have locked the door. It almost goes without saying, doesn't it?Ryunosuke: It, it does?Iris: Well if I was Ginny in that situation... ...I know I would have locked the door. As quickly as I could! I mean... ...those two burglars had just fired a gun in her direction, hadn't they?Ryunosuke: (Oh yes! Obviously...) Before the two brothers arrived, Miss Lestrade and Mr Windibank were in the storeroom together. Now...I don't know what went on between them at that time, but at some point... ...Mr Windibank must have heard the intruders breaking into his shop, and left the storeroom.Ringo: Intruders, eh? ...That's us, bruv!Van Zieks: If your theory is correct, that would leave the accused alone in the storeroom.Ryunosuke: ...Yes, it would. Then, probably only moments later, the victim fled back through the storeroom door hoping to escape danger.*BANG!*Ryunosuke: Hit in the back by the bullet, Mr Windibank fell to the floor where he was, just inside the storeroom. And what we have to ask ourselves now is, what would the defendant have done in that moment?Nash: Ah! I, I see where yer goin' wiv this!Ryunosuke: Outside the storeroom was a terrifying killer who had just murdered Mr Windibank. As soon as that thought struck Miss Lestrade, she slammed the door shut and locked it... ...in order to save her own life!Van Zieks: ...!Judge: ...!???:Nash: But, but I ain't- I mean, we ain't the ones who dunnit!Ringo: We ain't, guv, we ain't! You've gotta believe us! I mean, come on! We'd never shoot no one!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: That's blatantly untrue! I know for a fact that you would. Because before my own eyes...you shot Mr Herlock Sholmes!Ringo: ...!Nash: ...!Ryunosuke: There is only one logical conclusion here. Mr and Mr Skulkin, you brothers had every opportunity... ...to have been the true perpetrators of Mr Windibank's murder!Nash: Ah...em...um...Ringo: Erm...em...ugh...NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!Where, where does this leave us? You mean to say it wasn't the pickpocket who shot the pawnbroker after all? I should have known it was those three brothers! They look as shady as a dense forest!Iris: That was amazing, Runo! All the members of the jury seem to be firmly on your side now!Ryunosuke: I know! First time ever! And probably the last...Iris: Well, I think you've done it! Surely they'll have to give a verdict of not-Van Zieks: ...Keh...heh...heh... An admirable effort...my learned friend.Ryunosuke: ...! (What's this now? He's laughing?)Judge: You find the situation amusing, Lord van Zieks? I myself find the defence's argument most persuasive.Van Zieks: I dare say... ...such chicanery is the bread and butter of the street performers in your provincial Eastern nation. But such blatantly malicious conjuring tricks amount to nothing more than inexcusable pettifoggery here.Ryunosuke: What?!Van Zieks: The hypothesis you put forward so ostensibly credibly cannot, and will not stand. Because, you see, it contains a fatal flaw!Ryunosuke: A, a fatal flaw?!Van Zieks: ...Do you mean to tell me that you're unaware of your logic's failing?Juror No. 1: I say! Lord van Zieks... Might be an idea to explain this bally conjuring trick or whatever it is to the troops on the ground, hm?Van Zieks: The fatal flaw in my learned friend's argument is really very simple to understand... ...assuming you're not too dim-witted to count bullets!Juror No. 1: By George! Count bullets?!Iris: Oh dear... ...he noticed then.Ryunosuke: Huh? (What's everyone talking about?)Van Zieks: Counsel!Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, sir?!Van Zieks: Tell the court, how many bullets were found at the scene of the crime?Ryunosuke: Um...two. Two bullets.Van Zieks: Correct. The first, that which hit the victim in the back, ending his life. And the second, that which struck the 'detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes, on his arrival at the scene.Judge: Indeed. The defence presented a picture showing the damage caused by the second bullet earlier in the proceedings. The bullet which injured Mr Sholmes appears to have passed through his body to strike the calendar.Van Zieks: Your Lordship's understanding is correct. Furthermore, we know there are two firearms involved in the incident. The revolver belonging to the victim, Mr Windibank... ...and the Skulkin brothers' revolver. The evidence shows that a single bullet was fired from each gun.Judge: Yes! Indeed it does! A single bullet from each!Van Zieks: Now then, my learned friend...Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: You yourself told the court only moments ago... ...that these two brothers shot Mr Herlock Sholmes right before your eyes.Ryunosuke: Yes, I, I did!Juror No. 3: Oh my goodness! I, I think you'll find...Juror No. 4: That if the single bullet that was fired from the brothers' gun hit Mr Sholmes, it means...Juror No. 5: Windibank not shot by same gun! Stop. Only one bullet! Stop.Van Zieks: ...Exactly. Yes, this Nipponese street performer presented an ostensibly credible argument. ...However! It was never anything more than a diversionary trick with no hope of standing up to scrutiny!Ryunosuke: Ugh............ UWAAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!Van Zieks: ...Pray forgive the discourtesy of flinging the dregs of this hallowed nectar into the public gallery...Judge: L-Lord van Zieks!Van Zieks: ...but this court needs to open its eyes. The accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, is no ordinary little girl. Despite her young years, she can, regrettably, no longer be described as a juvenile. No, the person in the dock is far from a law-abiding citizen. She has a past riddled with criminal conduct!Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Van Zieks: The truth is, the accused broke into the pawnbrokery on the night in question with loathsome intent... ...as we can see beyond doubt in this print which depicts her threatening the victim with the murder weapon!Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Van Zieks: And I have here in my possession one more piece of evidence the prosecution wishes to present.Ryunosuke: ...! (That disk!)Gregson: I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much!Gina: No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!Gregson: I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.Ryunosuke: (Yes, that music box disk... McGilded's music box disk...)Van Zieks: The very day before the hateful murder of Mr Windibank... ...the accused attempted to make off with this article, which clearly doesn't belong to her. And with none of the subtlety of a pickpocket, I might add. But by brute force and brazen impudence.Judge: Good gracious!Van Zieks: Make no mistake! Any sympathy for the accused on account of her years is misguided and dangerous! There are no depths to which this girl would not stoop if pushed. No crime she would not commit. ...The court forgets that fact at its peril.Juror No. 5: ...!Juror No. 6: ...!Judge: Hm...I see... I think it would be prudent to take this music box disk into evidence, Counsel. As a grim testament to the defendant's character.???:Gregson: Um...Lord van Zieks...I, um...Ryunosuke: (Inspector Gregson...what...?)Van Zieks: Yes, Inspector?Gregson: We had a meetin' yesterday at the Yard with the prosecution service, and, um... ...I, I think it was agreed that that disk wouldn't be used as evidence.Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: (What's this all about? Why is the inspector acting strangely? That's the first time he's said anything to van Zieks at all...)Van Zieks: I am unaware of any such meeting.Gregson: But! But those were the instructions, right from the top. The government bigwigs were insistent!Van Zieks: Inspector, I am the prosecutor, and I alone determine how to present my case. Your warning is noted. ...Thank you.Gregson: ...!Van Zieks: The prosecution wishes to proceed with submitting this disk as evidence, My Lord.Judge: In-Indeed. Bailiff!The music box disk has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: The prosecution has established the accused's motive, opportunity and baseness of character. There is nothing more to add. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I await your informed decisions...and rest my case.Examine evidence Music Box Disk Bloodstain Iris: Oh! Runo, look! This is blood! Ryunosuke: Yes, you're right. (Just a small smear, but definitely blood. Actually, I feel as though I might have noticed that before...) Iris: Haha! Then it's my time to shine again! I thought I'd be waiting forever! Alright, hold still with that disk, Runo. Ryunosuke: Can we get this done quickly, Iris? Iris: In a flash! Ooh! A lovely bright shade again. Ryunosuke: ......... (Wait, that colour...) Iris: What is it? Ryunosuke: It's just...that green, it... ...it's not the first time we've seen that colour, is it? The blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record. Bloodstain (subsequent times) Iris: So this is blood! Probably from somebody's fingertip. Ryunosuke: Well deduced. But not just somebody's fingertip... Mr Benedict's fingertip. Iris: The man dressed all in white? Ryunosuke: Yes. It happened that afternoon in Windibank's. Gina tried to snatch this disk out of the man's hands, and the sharp little bumps cut his thumb. Iris: So the lesson is, if someone tries to grab a music box disk from you, let go quickly. Ryunosuke: ...The lesson is don't snatch things, surely? Note on back Iris: 'For McGilded'... That's the man you defended in court a couple of months ago, isn't it, Runo? Ryunosuke: Yes. Or rather, mistakenly defended. Iris: I wonder what his name is doing on the back of this disk... Ryunosuke: That's a question I'd love to know the answer to myself.Ryunosuke: (I don't believe it... I had the jury on my side for once, for all of five minutes...)Iris: Oh dear... It wasn't even for five minutes, Runo...???:My Lord!Juror No. 1: Wonder if I might say something at this point?Judge: Proceed, Mr Foreman.Juror No. 1: Been stumbling about in a bit of a fog up to now, if truth be told. But all of a sudden... ...the answer's bally obvious to me and my men! There's only one thing for it!Ryunosuke: (Oh no!)Judge: Very well. The court will hear from the jury. Ladies and gentlemen, you will present your leanings as to the defendant's culpability.Juror No. 1: Guilty!Juror No. 2: Guilty!Juror No. 3: Guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Guilty!Judge: We have a consensus among the jury, it seems.Van Zieks: When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains...must be the truth.Iris: That's, that's my line! I wrote that! For Hurley! Argh! How dare he use it against us?!Ryunosuke: Don't worry, Iris. I don't think we're finished yet. (There's still more to this case than we realise. There must be, because there's one thing that I'm absolutely certain of. Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank! That's beyond any doubt!)Judge: Very well... ...we will proceed with the second summation examination of the day. Mr Foreman, are you and the other jurors ready?Juror No. 1: Garrideb Squadron is primed and ready for action, sir!Judge: Very good. So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have now determined the defendant to be guilty!Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1: Once a rogue always a rogue, I say...hm? Different breed to us law-abiding citizens!Juror No. 2: As only two bullets were found at the scene, I would say the whole case is done and dusted.Juror No. 3: You don't need a stereoscope to see the truth here. Every which way you look at it, it was that pickpocket!Juror No. 4: Hm...I never imagined that simple operation would cause me such grief...Juror No. 5: The accused attempted a theft on the previous day. ...I can see I'm in for a busy day ahead.Juror No. 6: I am ballistics expert. I have seen many shootings. There is nothing I do not know about guns.Judge: Hmmm... It would seem there is little remaining room for doubt.Juror No. 1: Have to admit, I was rather bowled over by the argument put forward by the chap in black. But when that fell apart like a house of cards, I saw that I'd jolly well been hoodwinked. Well, no more!Ryunosuke: (Ugh...the whole courtroom is turning against me.)Iris: It's not fair!Ryunosuke: Iris?Iris: That prosecutor's being mean! Just because Ginny's done some things she shouldn't have done in the past... ...that doesn't make her a murderer!Van Zieks: Allow me to savour this fruity vintage while I savour the spectacle of your fruitless debate on the matter. Here's to the truth coming out...eventually.Ryunosuke: .........Judge: That's enough preamble. Counsel, proceed with the summation examination.Ryunosuke: ...Yes, My Lord.Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1: Once a rogue always a rogue, I say...hm? Different breed to us law-abiding citizens!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Just because Miss Lestrade has a history of pickpocketing, she must be guilty of murder, is that what you're saying? Juror No. 1: Ah...well... Ryunosuke: Are all members of the British army so quick to judge? Juror No. 1: I beg your pardon? Are you mocking Her Majesty's armed forces? The greatest military organisation in the world! Ryunosuke: No. I'm simply illustrating my point. Juror No. 1: ...! Ryunosuke: Making assumptions about people because they're a soldier...or a pickpocket...is wrong, and dangerous. Juror No. 1: Hmph. Well, yes, might have a point there, I suppose. But let's not forget the girl had already shown she had it in her from before. She's clearly a criminal sort through and through. Can't deny it. Ryunosuke: When you say that she'd 'shown she had it in her'...are you referring to this? Juror No. 1: Exactly. Tried to swipe that only a day earlier, hm? Or am I mistaken? Ryunosuke: ...Not exactly. (Given that I was actually there at the time, it's hard to refute that.) Iris: I've never actually seen the real thing. I can't wait to have a closer look at it! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, of course... Mr Sholmes did use his caramel bars to make a copy of the disk, didn't he. (And then ordered every type of music box he could find from across Europe...) Iris: We still don't know what tune it plays though, do we? But I'd love to see how the original compares to Hurley's copy. Ryunosuke: (McGilded's disk... Could it be a clue somehow? Perhaps we should examine it in more detail...)Juror No. 2: As only two bullets were found at the scene, I would say the whole case is done and dusted.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It's the number of bullets that has you convinced? Juror No. 2: Only two bullets were fired, and the two guns that fired them have been examined by the police. When the parlour maid asks me how many are invited for dinner, I always tell her to count the table settings. Ryunosuke: (Well, that's logical, I suppose.) Juror No. 2: Although... Ryunosuke: Yes? Juror No. 2: ...sometimes after dining, crockery does go missing. One or two guests rather like the fine china. Ryunosuke: ...Does your employer dine with thieves? Juror No. 2: So I suppose... ...if there was another bullet somewhere of which we were unaware... ...I'd have to reconsider my position. Ryunosuke: (...A third bullet somewhere on the scene? Could that be possible?) It's impossible Ryunosuke: Unfortunately... ...only two bullets were discovered by the police during their investigation. Juror No. 2: Yes, I know. Ryunosuke: Right... Juror No. 2: And I don't imagine the good men of Scotland Yard would have overlooked anything. If I missed a bullet while I was cleaning His Lordship's office, well! I should receive a sound scolding, I don't doubt. Ryunosuke: ...And he should receive a visit from the police, perhaps. It sounds like a crime scene to me. Iris: Hm, a third bullet.... Ryunosuke: It would completely turn things around if there was one, wouldn't it? Iris: ...Do you think we might find one lying around somewhere? Leads back to cross-examination I can prove it! Ryunosuke: Allow me to show you, then...the third bullet! Present The Third Bullet Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Here it is.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I, um...don't suppose this would pass as the third bullet? Van Zieks: It passes for a bullet as much as you pass for a lawyer... my learned friend. Ryunosuke: (Coming from you, I'm going to take that as meaning, 'not much'.) Van Zieks: In no way does it resemble a bullet...if that helps your understanding of my last remark. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Judge: Counsel, at the very least I would expect the evidence you present to be of the correct form! Ryunosuke: (...It's been a long day.) Iris: Let's actually try to find this third bullet before we attempt that again, Runo. Leads back to cross-examinationJuror No. 3: You don't need a stereoscope to see the truth here. Every which way you look at it, it was that pickpocket!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So if I've understood correctly, you need two pictures: a left eye one and a slightly different right eye one. Juror No. 3: Eeexactly! Then you can see the scene in three dimensions ...like this! Ryunosuke: So...if we have two bullets...I don't suppose you can see anything useful with them? Juror No. 3: Hm, I think you'll find... ...that no matter how much you squint, the truth of the situation always looks the same here. The only person who could have shot the victim is that girl in the dock! Ryunosuke: How can you be so sure of that? Juror No. 3: Think about it! The Skulkin brothers shot the great detective, didn't they? Ryunosuke: Yes...that's been mentioned once or twice... Juror No. 3: Well then! Surely it's coming into focus now, isn't it? Ryunosuke: (This is a waste of time. I'm not going to change this man's mind any time soon.)Juror No. 4: Hm...I never imagined that simple operation would cause me such grief...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Would you please stop muttering about things that have nothing to do with this trial, sir? The defendant's life is on the line here! Juror No. 4: Hm, well, the thing is... ...I couldn't really say that it is nothing to do with this trial, to be honest. Ryunosuke: Huh? Juror No. 4: I mean, there's no question that the man was shot, but the bullet had simply vanished from his stomach. It's quite inexplicable. ...Don't you think? Ryunosuke: ......... I almost don't want to ask, but this surgery you've been muttering about all this time. You were operating on... Juror No. 4: What was the fellow's name now? Herr Lich? ...No. Herr Loch? ...No. Hairlock? Ryunosuke: Herlock Sholmes by any chance? Juror No. 4: Yes! Good Lord! It was that Hairlock fellow! Ryunosuke: WHAAAT?! You're, you're the surgeon that operated on Mr Sholmes?! Juror No. 4: That's right. Using the very latest anaesthesia techniques, I might add! It was a fairly major op, I can tell you. Ryunosuke: (This is crazy!) Juror No. 4: Let me see, the fellow was brought in not long after midnight, if I remember correctly. They said he'd been shot by some criminal or other. So I opened him up like a shot. But the funny thing is, I went over his insides with a fine-tooth comb, and couldn't find the bullet anywhere. So I'm afraid I had to throw up my hands and just stitch the fellow back up. Ryunosuke: ......... I hate to state the obvious, but... Juror No. 4: Yes? Ryunosuke: ...surely that's because the bullet is still at the scene of the shooting! Judge: The counsel for the defence is correct. As is clearly shown in this photographic print. Ryunosuke: The bullet that the Skulkin brothers fired at Mr Sholmes hit him in the stomach region... ...then exited his body and lodged into the shop wall where the calendar was hanging by the door. I think you'll find it's really quite simple if you just consider the problem three-dimensionally. Juror No. 4: Hah! Who do you think I am, son? Ryunosuke: ...Um, well, 'juror number four' is about the best I can do. Juror No. 4: As soon as I saw the wound to the man's stomach, I flipped him over. Ryunosuke: ...Like a pancake? Are, are you saying that you checked his back? Juror No. 4: Of course I did! And there wasn't a trace of injury. No sign that the bullet had left the body at all! Ryunosuke: What? Juror No. 4: That's the point! The only logical conclusion was that the bullet was still somewhere in the man's innards! Which is exactly why I set about slicing him up! And I'm still none the wiser, even now! How many times do I have to say it? Can somebody please explain how it happened? Can somebody please solve the mystery! Ryunosuke: ...It's almost as much of a mystery as how this jury was put together. Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"The mystery of where that bullet ended up is infuriating! Where's an expert when you need one?\"Juror No. 4: The mystery of where that bullet ended up is infuriating! Where's an expert when you need one?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes's surgeon is on the jury...? I've experienced some coincidences recently, but this is ridiculous. Juror No. 4: I'm as surprised as anyone! Ryunosuke: But there's no question that Mr Sholmes was shot? Juror No. 4: Well, that's what the police told me when they brought him in. Iris: ...How bad were his injuries, doctor? Juror No. 4: He was in a bad way. He'd lost a huge amount of blood, you know. And I suspect he was shot at quite close range, too. Because his skin was badly burnt around the point of entry. Ryunosuke: Burnt? Juror No. 4: As I said, I flipped the fellow over and examined his back, but there was no sign of an exit wound. Which is why I thought I'd better locate the lug and pop it out. Ryunosuke: And yet you say you found no bullet inside the patient? Juror No. 4: Well I wouldn't have done, would I? Because it's in the wall of the pawnbroker's. But how did it get there?! I need someone to solve this mystery before it drives me to insanity! If only there were some expert in ballistics who could help! Even if he looked extremely untrustworthy! Ryunosuke: (So we have a disappearing bullet on our hands...)Pit against Juror No. 6's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict...the idea that all I do is pit jurors against each other! Juror No. 4: Ooh! A ballistics expert! Juror No. 6: 'Pitting'... 'P-i-t-t-...' Ryunosuke: On the night in question, Mr Sholmes was shot by one of the Skulkin brothers. But since there was no sign of an exit wound on his back, we must assume the bullet didn't pass through him. However, no bullet was found lodged in Mr Sholmes's body, either. Furthermore... ...a bullet was found lodged in the wall of the shop where Mr Sholmes was shot. Juror number six... Juror No. 6: 'Hello. My name is Vilen. Pleased to meet you.' Ryunosuke: This apparent contradiction in the facts that is so clearly troubling juror number four... Are you able to explain the mystery? Juror No. 6: ......... I have seen wery similar situation in motherland. Ryunosuke: ...! Juror No. 6: It was night. There was blizzard. I was running away long mountain round in freezing cold. Judge: Golly. Juror No. 6: The snow was piling high on both sides of road. It was wery narrow and dangerous. My pursuers had hunting rifles and they were on dog sleds. Ryunosuke: (...Mental note: don't ask too many questions.) Juror No. 6: I was shot from behind, and I fell down in snow. And this situation was wery similar to what I hear today from doctor. They could not find bullet in my body. And no sign of - how do you say? - exit wound. Judge: Then, then where did the bullet go? Juror No. 6: Bullet never hit me. Juror No. 4: Well if it never hit you, why did you fall down? Juror No. 6: Bullet hit frozen wall of ice wery close to my side. Ryunosuke: What?! Juror No. 6: One small piece - wery sharp - broke away from lump of ice and pierced my body. It made deep wound that looks just like bullet wound. Juror No. 4: Good gracious... Juror No. 6: Of course, piece of ice quickly melted inside me. And that is solution to mystery of disappearing bullet. Ryunosuke: ......... Juror No. 6: ......... Juror No. 4: But, but that doesn't answer the question at all! Ryunosuke: Hm? Juror No. 4: The shooting happened in a pawnbroker's shop... ...not some snowy mountain road in another country! Ryunosuke: ......... ...Just an idea, but we might not be looking at EXACTLY the same scenario here. Iris: Runo... ...where exactly was Hurley shot again? Ryunosuke: Um, well, according to the report, in his stomach. Sort of around this area, I think. Iris: Well...that's precisely where he always wears a little pouch on his belt. Ryunosuke: A pouch? (Actually, I might have noticed something like that.) Iris: Yes, a pouch. It's where he keeps three glass phials of very dangerous chemicals that he uses in his investigations. Ryunosuke: What?! (Really?) Doctor! Where is the pouch Mr Sholmes was wearing? Juror No. 4: Hm, well... ...the fellow had nothing like that on his person when he arrived at the hospital as far as I remember. Van Zieks: If I may... Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks...? Van Zieks: While I realise it is forbidden for the prosecution to interject during a summation examination... ...I should inform the defence that I have the pouch in question in the antechamber outside the courtroom. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: As I understand it, when the police arrived on the scene and found Mr Sholmes injured... ...they removed the pouch in order to assess the wound. Juror No. 4: Ah! Thank goodness. I thought I was getting forgetful for a moment! Van Zieks: Since then, it has been in my safekeeping along with all other evidence relating to the case. I can personally vouch for the fact that it has not been touched since the incident occurred. Judge: Very well. While extremely unconventional during a summation examination... ...I must demand the prosecution presents the item in question with all speed. Bring forth Mr Herlock Sholmes's pouch! Judge: Hm, I see... So this is the pouch worn by Mr Sholmes on the night in question, is it? Ryunosuke: Look at that! One of the phials is broken and the leather around it is scorched black! It's almost as if...the phial exploded! Judge: Exploded? Ryunosuke: So...that night... ...the bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun struck Mr Sholmes's pouch. Juror No. 4: And it was the glass phial exploding that caused the fellow's injury! Juror No. 6: The bullet did not penetrate wictim, but was deflected into wall of shop. Van Zieks: ......... ...A delightfully complex aroma. Judge: Well, it would appear one mystery has been solved at least. Van Zieks: Though it has no bearing on the truth of this case. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: The bungling and burgling brothers shot the detective, and the accused shot the pawnbroker. The pertinent facts of the case remain unaltered. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 4: But at least the mystery is solved! I can sleep easy tonight! Thank you, young man! Juror No. 6: ...Da. 'Thank you wery much.' Ryunosuke: ...Glad I could help. Judge: Due to its bearing on the conundrum just solved, the court will sequester this scruffy pouch as evidence. Iris: Hurley's pouch isn't scruffy! Sholmes's pouch has been entered into the Court Record. Judge: Now, the summation examination... It would appear the defence is somewhat struggling to alter opinion, hm? Ryunosuke: Please, My Lord! A little more time. (After all, that's a new piece of evidence. It could be a valuable clue. And you can't afford to overlook anything here, Ryunosuke. There's still a way to turn this around...somehow. I'm sure of it!) Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.\"Examine evidence Sholmes's Pouch Scorch mark on left side Ryunosuke: (It's really scorched badly just here...) Iris: Oh! The strap is broken, look! Ryunosuke: This must be where the bullet hit, then. Iris: Let me see... Bullet Ryunosuke: Wh-What the... Iris! Look! Behind where the broken phial was... Do you see it? Iris: AAAH! That's... ...the Skulkin brothers' bullet! Ryunosuke: (What a stroke of luck that it hit his pouch!) This is an amazing discovery! (What this means is... ...there were three bullets fired at Windibank's that night!) Iris: We've found exactly what that juror was talking about! The third bullet! Ryunosuke: It's time to press that juror again, I think! The third bullet has been entered into the Court Record. Bullet hole (after examining bullet) Ryunosuke: (This is where the third bullet was lodged. Imagine what would have happened if it had pierced the leather... Thank goodness Mr Sholmes is going to be alright.) Scorch mark on left side (after examining bullet) Ryunosuke: (It's really scorched badly just here...) Iris: Yes, the strap is broken. Ryunosuke: Ripped apart by the bullet, obviously.  Iris: Let me see... Hole on back Ryunosuke: Oh look...there's a hole here at the back. (It doesn't look much like a bullet hole. But clearly something's ripped through the leather with great force.) Iris: Something must have pierced it somehow to have left this hole behind. Ryunosuke: Yes, it looks that way. Mr Sholmes and his pouch both took a beating, didn't they? Broken vial Ryunosuke: This phial has been smashed to pieces. Presumably this is where the bullet struck. Iris: As soon as the bullet hit the chemical in that phial, there would have been a really big explosion. Ryunosuke: A big explosion?! Iris: Well Hurley's potions and chemicals are amazingly useful for the investigation work he does. But they're also quite tricky to handle. Safely, at least. They're very dangerous. Ryunosuke: Oh. Iris: I'm sure that when this phial broke, the chemical inside would have ignited. Ryunosuke: ......... (Note to self: Always walk on the right-hand side of Sholmes in future. The left is the danger zone.) Intact vials Iris: These glass phials are full of Hurley's homemade potions. Ryunosuke: Homemade...? Iris: Yes, like fingerprint powder to show up where people have touched things... ...and scent-amplifying solution to intensify a smell lingering on an object. Ryunosuke: That's...amazing. Iris: They're all very easy to use. There's just one thing that you have to be careful of: They're all very flammable. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes is a walking bomb! (Either he's passionate about finding out the truth, or just oblivious to the dangers...) The Third Bullet Bullet Ryunosuke: This is the bullet that was fired from the Skulkin brothers' gun on the night of the incident. Iris: Yes. So it turns out it never actually entered Hurley's body at all. Ryunosuke: Thanks to the thick leather of that pouch he was wearing. It saved him. Iris: Hehe, Hurley's always lucky like that. Ryunosuke: Well...considering what he had to go through in hospital... ...I wonder how lucky he really was. Iris: Oh dear...poor Hurley...Juror No. 4: Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Then I ask you to reconsider your leaning, sir! Juror No. 4: Oh no, that's another matter entirely. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Juror No. 4: All I can think about for the moment...is this wonderful sense of relief I have that the mystery is solved. I need some time to let that sink in before I could possibly consider anything else. Ryunosuke: Alright... (I thought surgeons had to be able to think quickly...) Iris: Perhaps we should leave him alone for now while he savours his inner peace... ...and focus on some of the other jurors? Ryunosuke: I suppose we'll have to. ...I wish I had the chance to experience inner peace sometimes.Juror No. 5: The accused attempted a theft on the previous day. ...I can see I'm in for a busy day ahead.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you mean, you're in for a busy day? Juror No. 5: Forgot to say. Stop. Do excuse me. Stop. I am a communications officer. Stop. Ryunosuke: A communications officer? Does that have something to do with sending telegrams? Juror No. 5: Everything from personal messages written by members of the public to the latest news in the capital. I convert all the messages into morse code and tap it out to the entire world electronically. Ryunosuke: To...the entire world? Juror No. 5: Thousands of miles of cable under the sea! Stop. Worldwide communication network! Stop. Information transmitted to and from all corners of globe! Stop. Ryunosuke: (Ah yes... ...she was getting equally worked up about radio waves or the like before, wasn't she?) Juror No. 5: I specialise in communicating information from government departments and newspaper offices. Ryunosuke: I see. Juror No. 5: I'm sure I shall have to wire the newspaper reports of today's guilty verdict later. So no sleep for me tonight, I imagine. Ryunosuke: (...Let's just finish the trial first, shall we?)Juror No. 6: I am ballistics expert. I have seen many shootings. There is nothing I do not know about guns.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I thought...you were just a tourist? Juror No. 6: ......... 'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.' Ryunosuke: (...There's no way he's just a 'wisiting' tourist.) So...you're a ballistics expert? ...Who knew?

Extreme violent bloodbaths, perhaps? Juror No. 6: Da! Those! Extreme wiolent bloodbaths! ...English is wery difficult language. Ryunosuke: (...Considering the sort of people you associate with, I'm surprised you still have a tongue.) Juror No. 6: Anyway. If you have questions about bullets and guns, you ask me. There is nothing I do not know. No mystery I cannot solve. Ryunosuke: (He's very confident in his knowledge of guns, that's for sure.) Juror No. 6: But...if possible, please, only in Russian language. Iris: He's not very confident in his knowledge of English, though, is he? Ryunosuke: No... Still, we should bear it in mind. (He's our man if there's a mystery about guns or bullets.)Pit against Juror No. 4's statement (after Juror No. 4 changes his statement, before Juror No. 4 changes his statement a second time) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict...the idea that all I do is pit jurors against each other!

(Actually, I might have noticed something like that.) Iris: Yes, a pouch. It's where he keeps three glass phials of very dangerous chemicals that he uses in his investigations. Ryunosuke: What?! (Really?) Doctor! Where is the pouch Mr Sholmes was wearing? Juror No. 4: Hm, well... ...the fellow had nothing like that on his person when he arrived at the hospital as far as I remember. Van Zieks: If I may... Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks...? Van Zieks: While I realise it is forbidden for the prosecution to interject during a summation examination... ...I should inform the defence that I have the pouch in question in the antechamber outside the courtroom. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: As I understand it, when the police arrived on the scene and found Mr Sholmes injured... ...they removed the pouch in order to assess the wound. Juror No. 4: Ah! Thank goodness. I thought I was getting forgetful for a moment! Van Zieks: Since then, it has been in my safekeeping along with all other evidence relating to the case. I can personally vouch for the fact that it has not been touched since the incident occurred. Judge: Very well. While extremely unconventional during a summation examination... ...I must demand the prosecution presents the item in question with all speed. Bring forth Mr Herlock Sholmes's pouch! Judge: Hm, I see... So this is the pouch worn by Mr Sholmes on the night in question, is it? Ryunosuke: Look at that! One of the phials is broken and the leather around it is scorched black! It's almost as if...the phial exploded! Judge: Exploded? Ryunosuke: So...that night... ...the bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun struck Mr Sholmes's pouch. Juror No. 4: And it was the glass phial exploding that caused the fellow's injury! Juror No. 6: The bullet did not penetrate wictim, but was deflected into wall of shop. Van Zieks: ......... ...A delightfully complex aroma. Judge: Well, it would appear one mystery has been solved at least. Van Zieks: Though it has no bearing on the truth of this case. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: The bungling and burgling brothers shot the detective, and the accused shot the pawnbroker. The pertinent facts of the case remain unaltered. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 4: But at least the mystery is solved! I can sleep easy tonight! Thank you, young man! Juror No. 6: ...Da. 'Thank you wery much.' Ryunosuke: ...Glad I could help. Judge: Due to its bearing on the conundrum just solved, the court will sequester this scruffy pouch as evidence. Iris: Hurley's pouch isn't scruffy! Sholmes's pouch has been entered into the Court Record. Judge: Now, the summation examination... It would appear the defence is somewhat struggling to alter opinion, hm? Ryunosuke: Please, My Lord! A little more time. (After all, that's a new piece of evidence. It could be a valuable clue. And you can't afford to overlook anything here, Ryunosuke. There's still a way to turn this around...somehow. I'm sure of it!) Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.\"Before Sholmes's Pouch is added to Court Record Ryunosuke: (Van Zieks has managed to convince everyone...) Iris: 'When you have eliminated the impossible...' he said. But he hasn't! Ryunosuke: (If we're going to fight back, we need more material. And we have to fight back! We have to turn this trial around again!)After Sholmes's Pouch is added to Court Record Iris: Hurley always turns up at just the right moment! Ryunosuke: ...Does he always come in the form of a pouch? (Seriously though, it sounds like the great detective was on death's door. But maybe his injuries won't be for nothing. That pouch could be a very valuable clue.)Ryunosuke: Here it is. We discovered it just now. Yes! On the night in question in Windibank's pawnbrokery...another bullet was fired!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: What is this new trickery, you Nipponese conjurer?! Where did you find that bullet?Ryunosuke: It was lodged inside Mr Sholmes's pouch.Van Zieks: What?!Ryunosuke: This pouch was removed from around Mr Sholmes's waist before he was taken to hospital. And since then, it has been touched by no one.Judge: Do, do you mean to say... ...the shot fired by the Skulkin brothers that night...Ryunosuke: Yes. As your Lordship has surmised...it hit this pouch.Judge: But that makes no sense whatsoever! We already know the whereabouts of the bullet fired at Mr Sholmes. It's clearly visible in this photographic print!Juror No. 1: Ah!Ryunosuke: Two guns from the scene have already been submitted into the Court Record as evidence.Judge: Yes. That of Mr Windibank, and that belonging to the Skulkin brothers.Ryunosuke: And examination of both guns revealed... ...that only a single bullet had been fired from each.Juror No. 2: Ah!Juror No. 3: But, but that must mean...Ryunosuke: That's right. We now know that on the night in question, three bullets were fired. However! Only two bullets were fired from the guns recovered from the crime scene! And until that incontrovertible inconsistency is somehow explained... ...we cannot and must not pass judgement!Van Zieks: Agk......... AAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! While this summation examination remains incomplete, the court has been presented with new facts. Facts that would appear to shake the very foundations upon which the case against the defendant has been built.Van Zieks: ...!Judge: As is my prerogative in this situation... ...I hereby temporarily suspend the summation examination.Juror No. 1: By Jupiter!Ryunosuke: What?!Judge: Bailiff! Bring the witnesses back to the stand at once!Judge: Witnesses...Nash: Guvnor!Judge: Were you listening to proceedings while the defence carried out the summation examination?Ringo: We woz, guvnor, we woz!Van Zieks: Perhaps we can dispense with the tedious preamble. Simply answer this one question: A third bullet has been identified at the scene of the crime. ...What do you make of that?Nash: Make of it, guv? I dun't make nuffin' of nuffin' if I can 'elp it. Um...Van Zieks: Is it one of yours?Ringo: Gorblimey, guv, gorblimey! Not a chance!Van Zieks: In that case...did you have an accomplice?Nash: Wot?! Eh? Wot?! Never! The Skulkin bruvvers work alone!Ringo: It's just the two of us! That's our trademark!Ryunosuke: (...How soon we forget poor Sulky...)Van Zieks: Only two of the bullets from the crime scene originated from the firearms we have in evidence. The third bullet was fired from another gun. ...Where is it?Nash: Lummy...that's an 'ead-scratcher... .........Judge: Hmmm... Counsel for the Defence...Ryunosuke: Y-Yes?Judge: I should like to hear your thoughts regarding these new developments. The third bullet...and the mysterious missing firearm from whence it came.Ryunosuke: (Thinking back over all the testimony we've heard and all the evidence we've seen... ...I think I'm starting to form a picture. A picture of what really happened that night.) My Lord, I think it's clear what this third bullet tells us about the Skulkin brothers:They had a secret accomplice Ryunosuke: On that night at Windibank's pawnbrokery...the brothers must have been working with a third man. Nash: Erm... Ryunosuke: The witnesses are clearly doing their best to cover up the existence of this accomplice... ...but the evidence all points to the fact that there was someone else present! Someone carrying a gun! Van Zieks: Leads to: \"...An accomplice, you say?\"They had another gun Ryunosuke: On that night at Windibank's pawnbrokery...the brothers must have been in possession of another gun. Nash: Erm... Ryunosuke: We know that only one bullet was fired from each of the two firearms already in the Court Record. The logical conclusion, therefore... ...is that the brothers were working with an accomplice! An accomplice who was carrying a gun! Leads to: \"...An accomplice, you say?\"It's nothing to do with them Ryunosuke: I believe...it has nothing to do with them. Nash: Eh? Ringo: Eh, Nash, eh! That's right! Nash: Yeah! Nuffin' to do wiv us, guv! Ryunosuke: We've established that one bullet was fired from each of the two guns already known to the court. The logical conclusion therefore, is that on the night in question at Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery... ...there was another person present in possession of a third firearm. Van Zieks: ...! Ryunosuke: Whilst the brothers may have had nothing to do with the third gun or the bullet fired from it... ...it's inconceivable that they had nothing to do with the third man. Yes! The brothers were working with an accomplice! An accomplice who was carrying a gun! Leads to: \"...An accomplice, you say?\"Van Zieks: ...An accomplice, you say? Pigswill.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: These protracted proceedings have already forced us to endure two summation examinations. Yet in all that time, there has been not a murmur of a third man. If this apparently wraithlike being exists... ...the court must be shown hard evidence! Without it, this fantasy will be crushed.Ryunosuke: Agh!Van Zieks: The prosecution demands answers on two counts: Firstly: proof - evidence - that this accomplice was ever at the scene of the crime. And secondly... ...the identity of this spurious character.Ryunosuke: (The Skulkins are lying. I know that. But... ...how can I ascertain the identity of the person they're hiding?)Judge: Well, Counsel?Ryunosuke: ......... (I'm supposed to prove the existence of this accomplice... and reveal the person's identity, even...) In response to the prosecution's demands, My Lord, the defence is...Ready to present answers Ryunosuke: The defence is ready. I believe I can provide all the answers the prosecution demands. Van Zieks: So, my Nipponese friend, despite the swimming eyes, you seem to think you have something to say. This promises to be interesting. Ryunosuke: (I have to push forward now. There's no other option. I need to use every single piece of evidence available to me if it will make a difference...) Leads to: \"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Unable to present answers Ryunosuke: The defence is... ......... Van Zieks: Unable to complete a sentence, it would seem. Much less provide any credible answers here. Judge: Yes, it would appear so. Very well, this trial will now- Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Wait! Please! Judge: Good gracious, Counsel! Ryunosuke: (I have to keep the momentum going here. I can't give up now!) Iris: This is just like scientific research if you ask me. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: When you start doubting yourself and thinking you can't possibly work something out, you become blind. Even though in truth, the answer you're looking for is right there in front of you. Ryunosuke: (The answer...is right here in front of me!) ...My Lord! Actually...the defence would like to present answers to the questions posed by the prosecution. Van Zieks: Van Zieks: So, my Nipponese friend, despite the swimming eyes, you seem to think you have something to say. But your earlier tongue-tied display will not go unpunished. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (Now I wish I'd bit my tongue instead of speaking before I'd made up my mind. It would have hurt less.) Leads to: \"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Judge: In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay. On the night in question, in the moments leading up to the death of the victim... ...what proof have you that there was a third intruder present at the scene?Present Blood Samples Portfolio Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The evidence is right here...in this portfolio.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The evidence...is this! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: My learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Ryunosuke: The evidence is right here...in this portfolio.Judge: By Jove! That portfolio again, is it?Van Zieks: Do you expect the court to rifle through your papers itself? Be more specific!Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: You claim one of those blood samples proves the presence of this third intruder. Well, which one is it?Present Windibank's Main Shop sample Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"What am I looking at here?\"Present any other sample Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: THIS is the blood sample that proves it! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"You claim one of those blood samples proves the presence of this third intruder.\"Judge: What am I looking at here? There appears to be some green paint or suchlike around the bullet hole in the middle of the calendar.Ryunosuke: That's a bloodstain, My Lord.Judge: A bloodstain?Van Zieks: Green blood? Curious, even for you. Is the court to understand that the intruder was some unhuman creature?Ryunosuke: It's...something developed by Mr Herlock Sholmes.Juror No. 3: By the great detective!Juror No. 5: New invention! Stop. Not yet appeared in stories! Stop.Iris: It's this, you see. It...doesn't have a name yet, though. This fogger sprays a chemical that reacts with the different elements in people's blood to change its colour.Judge: Different elements...of people's blood...?Iris: Yes. Everyone's blood is slightly different, you see. Because it's made up of different elements. So by seeing what colour it changes to, you can tell in a flash whose blood it is!Juror No. 3: Ooh! That brings a whole extra dimension to looking at blood!Juror No. 5: Talk of blood in courtroom! Stop. Very exciting! Stop.Ryunosuke: As an example, this one shows the blood of the victim, Mr Windibank.Judge: Ah... A striking blue.Ryunosuke: Yes. So you see, the green colour of this bloodstain on the calendar... ...shows that somebody else was shot in the main part of the shop!Juror No. 1: Now hold fire there, young man! Could be from some unrelated incident, couldn't it?Ryunosuke: No. It's not unrelated.Juror No. 1: ...!Ryunosuke: The date showing on the calendar is the date on which Mr Windibank was killed.Juror No. 1: By golly!Ryunosuke: Therefore we can assume that whoever was shot, was shot on the same day.Juror No. 4: Then whose blood is it?!Ryunosuke: Well, the Skulkin brothers in the stand don't appear to be suffering from any gunshot injuries... Which means it must be the blood of somebody else. The third intruder, in fact.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Whose identity the court is still waiting to hear. You can't delay this any longer, my learned friend. Who is this alleged third intruder?Present Eggert Benedict profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The man's name...is Eggert Benedict.\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: There can be no doubt! THIS is the shadowy accomplice the brothers have been trying so hard to protect! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: A lottery? Is that how you decide who's guilty? Ryunosuke: Hm? Van Zieks: In that case, the name Ryunosuke Naruhodo should be added to the draw. For being guilty of incompetence! Ryunosuke: GAAAAAAGH! (...And I bet my lot would be drawn, too.) Iris: The identity of this accomplice is our trump card, Runo.  Ryunosuke: Yes...I, I expect it is... Iris: At this point, we're the only ones who know the person's identity. But it's time to stun the courtroom now! Let's give everyone something to think about! Ryunosuke: Yes... YES! Leads back to: \"You can't delay this any longer, my learned friend.\"!Ryunosuke: The man's name...is Eggert Benedict.Judge: Eggert Benedict?! Who on earth are you talking about, Counsel?Ryunosuke: He paid a visit to Windibank's pawnbrokery on the afternoon before the incident took place.Van Zieks: When the accused attempted to deceive the pawnbroker into releasing this article into her possession.Ryunosuke: ...That's right.Van Zieks: ...!Ryunosuke: The man identified by the defence, Mr Eggert Benedict... ...then attempted to take the article from the defendant by force.???: Broker!Windibank: Um, yes, sir????: I believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemed an article from you, no?Windibank: Yes, yes, erm...???: The article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once.Gina: Now that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull????: Give me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box disks, too.Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson was there at the time, and can attest to what happened. In the end, it was the inspector himself who took the disk.Judge: Can you corroborate this account, Inspector?Gregson: Erm, yes, My Lord. That's more or less what happened. And in the interests of bein' thorough, I asked Windibank for a print showin' the fellow. Taken from one of his 'Red-Handed Recorder' gubbinses.Ryunosuke: (Yes! That's him talking to Mr Windibank that morning.)Judge: And you claim this man is the brothers' accomplice?Ryunosuke: Well, Mr and Mr Skulkin?Nash: ......... Never seen the geezer before in me life!Ringo: On me life, guv, on me life! Never seen 'im!Judge: Well...somewhat unsurprisingly, it appears our witnesses disagree with the assertion.Van Zieks: I'm sure Your Lordship recalls my learned Nipponese friend's actual assertion. Which was that he could prove the identity of the alleged accomplice.Ryunosuke: Yes, and I can!Juror No. 3: Then show us the evidence!Juror No. 2: I agree! We must see proof that the clean-cut gentleman in the photograph is the filthy criminal you say he is!Ryunosuke: ......... (This is the last piece of evidence... I've had a feeling that something has been missing in this trial from the very start. But now...I'm going to drag it kicking and screaming into the courtroom!)Judge: Are you ready to present your answer to the court then, Counsel?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. The defence will present the evidence now. Proof that the man pictured in this photographic print was in fact the person struck by the third bullet!Present Music Box Disk (after examining bloodstain during trial) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question...\"Present Blood Samples Portfolio Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That proof is right here, in this portfolio! Judge: Good gracious, Counsel! Does that portfolio contain the answers to every question posed? Van Zieks: ...I see you share my interest in claret-coloured liquids, my Nipponese friend. But... Enough. The court demands to see further evidence. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Which blood sample proves the man you identified was the one shot by the third bullet at the scene of the crime? Present Music Box Disk sample Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question...\" Present any other sample Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: THIS is the blood sample that proves it! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! (It has to be a sample that links the bloodstain at the scene to Mr Benedict...) Iris: In other words, we need a sample of blood that turned the same colour as that bloodstain. Ryunosuke: (Another green sample? ...Did we have one of those?) Iris: I think perhaps you should have another look through everything, Runo. Ryunosuke: Right. I might need to go over the evidence again. (Where else did we notice a bloodstain?) Leads back to: \"Enough. The court demands to see further evidence.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Here it is! This is the irrefutable evidence! Judge: I'm sorry, Counsel, but I fail to see the connection. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: It seems my learned friend is wide of the mark...again. In fact...he has just shot himself in the foot! Ryunosuke: GYAAAAAAGH! (I'll have to try that one more time. Even though my foot is killing me here...) Judge: I might remind you, Counsel, of the gravity of the choices you make in this courtroom. Think very carefully. Leads back to: \".........\"Ryunosuke: As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question... ...the defendant attempted - deceitfully, admittedly - to reclaim this disk from Windibank's.Judge: Which is when the aforementioned Eggert Benedict appeared on the scene, I believe. This man then attempted to purloin the article from the defendant's possession, no?Ryunosuke: That's correct, My Lord. I myself was present at the time. It was following this that a minor incident occurred.Windibank: But of course, sir. Here is the disk for you.Benedict: ......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style.Gina: Wait a minute! That disk... ...is mine!Benedict: Argh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal!Ryunosuke: Being a music box disk, it has countless small but sharp metal protrusions over its surface. Those protrusions caused Mr Benedict's finger to bleed. And the resulting smear of blood is still visible on the disk now.Judge: Goodness! A bloodstain, is it?Ryunosuke: My assistant and I have just analysed the bloodstain here in this very courtroom.Iris: Using...my trusty fogger gun!Ryunosuke: Yes. And we added the results to this portfolio.Juror No. 1:I say!Juror No. 2:It's green!Juror No. 5:It's exactly the same colour as the blood around the calendar!Ryunosuke: The evidence is conclusive! The man calling himself Mr Eggert Benedict, who was in Windibank's earlier in the day... ...is the accomplice who was present at the scene of the crime that same night!So there was someone else there! Look at those two brothers now! They're sweating buckets!Oi! Who are you talkin' about? ...It's boilin' in 'ere!Ryunosuke: My Lord! It is the opinion of the defence... ...that Mr Eggert Benedict...should be summoned to the courtroom to testify!Judge: Hmmm... It would certainly seem that we can ill afford to ignore this gentleman's apparent presence.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ...This has gone on long enough now. This flagrant ignorance of the mechanics of law.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: Herlock Sholmes, you say? Yes, I've heard the name. The protagonist in a series of short stories for the vulgar classes. A god of detection or some such.Iris: ...!Van Zieks: And now you employ chemical substances devised by this fantastical persona in the highest court in the land? Do you expect us to take you seriously? The samples made by this plaything are not fit to be called evidence.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: So the bloodstain turned a shade of green. What of it? Here's to you successfully proving that no other blood in the world would turn the same colour.Ryunosuke: Ah...well...Van Zieks: And pray, do not even think of suggesting that we should take Mr Sholmes's word for it!Ryunosuke: Ugh...Is he right? Is Mr Sholmes's concoction a load of rubbish? I don't know... I mean, he is a great detective.What are you talking about?! We can't let him get away with that!Ryunosuke: ......... (I knew it would come to this. Of course Mr Sholmes's invention isn't going to be recognised by any official body. But...what other choice did I have...?)Iris: Hm... I'm just remembering what Father Christmas over there said before. About how he was temporarily suspending the summation examination.Ryunosuke: Ah!Iris: In other words... ...the examination isn't over yet, is it?Judge: G-Good grief! What did you just say, young girl?Iris: And in a summation examination, the decision as to whether or not the trial continues... ...is in the hands of the six jurors, isn't it?Van Zieks: ...!Iris: So the way I see it... ...it doesn't matter what certain other people think of Hurley's invention. At least, not for now!Ryunosuke: Yes! (She's right!)Judge: Young lady, you have quite the devious mind!Iris: It really just comes down to one thing: Whether these ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...are convinced by what you say, Runo! ...Is that about right, would you say? Or did I misunderstand something?Ryunosuke: (Unbelievable! Mr Sholmes's partner is a force to be reckoned with!)Iris: Iris Wilson...sharpshooter!Judge: After that shrewd precis of the situation from an entirely unexpected source... ...it must be acknowledged that the previous summation examination has yet to reach its conclusion.Van Zieks: This is absurd!Judge: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the court now looks to you for your final leanings in this matter.Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Judge: As proud citizens of Her Majesty's Britain, I'm sure you will come to fair and just conclusions.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Judge: So then, state your final decisions in turn, please.Juror No. 1: Not guilty!Juror No. 2: Not guilty!Juror No. 3: Not guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Not guilty!Judge: Two call guilty, and four call not guilty. Such is the outcome of the summation examination.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: My Lord, with all due respect, this is an outrage! The prosecution refuses to accept this decision!Judge: ...On what grounds?Van Zieks: If these jurors are persuaded by some half-baked concoction devised by a pretender to real police work... ...then they are too ignorant to be trusted with the judgement of anyone's guilt.Judge: I'm sorry, Lord van Zieks, but the outcome of the summation examination cannot be ignored. This trial will continue!Van Zieks: Agk......... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge: ...Nevertheless, we find ourselves in a rather awkward situation. The defence has very reasonably requested the subpoena of a new witness. But sadly, I fear that will be impossible.Ryunosuke: What?Judge: The name the gentleman gave for himself - Eggert Benedict - is quite clearly false.Ryunosuke: (I don't believe it! Just when I'd managed to prove the man was there that night...)???:...Um... Could, could I say something?Judge: ...? Who was that, please? Who spoke?Juror No. 5: Um...it was me, My Lord.Ryunosuke: (Juror number five...?)Judge: What have you to say, madam?Juror No. 5: If possible...Inspector...Gregson: Eh? ...Me, ma'am?Juror No. 5: I wonder if you might show the photographic print to me again? The one in which the gentleman is shown.Gregson: Ah, right, yes. This one, you mean? Of Mr Benedict?Juror No. 5: ......... ......... .........Yes... There's no doubt in my mind.Ryunosuke: Juror number five, you don't mean to say... You know this man?Juror No. 5: Yes, I know him.Ryunosuke: What?!Van Zieks: No!Judge: GOOD GRACIOUS!!! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Juror number five! How on earth...?Juror No. 5: I am a communications officer. Stop.Ryunosuke: ...As we can clearly see...Juror No. 5: The gentleman in the photograph is... Stop. ...also a communications officer. Stop. He works in my office. Stop. A very talented operator in fact! Stop. He should be in the communication station now. Stop. Tapping away on the telegraph. Stop.Ryunosuke: (This doesn't seem right somehow... I can't put my finger on why, but...it doesn't feel right.)Iris: Hm... I suppose we all imagined the accomplice would be some sort of hardened criminal. It's...a bit unexpected to find out that he has a respectable job by day, whatever he gets up to at night.Ryunosuke: Yes...I suppose that's it. (I suppose that's why I felt something was wrong...)Judge: If the gentleman is at London's communication station, we should be able to subpoena him within the hour. Lord van Zieks, if you please...Van Zieks: ...Yes, My Lord?Judge: Make the necessary arrangements with all haste!Van Zieks: As Your Lordship bids.Judge: The court will recess for one hour. When the new witness arrives, we shall reconvene to hear the gentleman's testimony. Inspector Gregson...Gregson: Yes, My Lord?Judge: I should like to hear from you specifically about events at the pawnbrokery on the day in question. Come to my chambers during the recess.Gregson: Yes, sir, My Lord.Judge: Very well... Court is adjourned until 1:40 p.m.!To be continued...17th April, 12:41 p.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberRyunosuke: Ah, Gina. How are you holding up?Gina: .........Ryunosuke: (I'm starting to feel quite warmly towards her frequent cold shoulders now.)Iris: Ginny! Are you alright? Why aren't you saying anything?Gina: ......... Wot's the point, eh? Why go to all this trouble an' fight so 'ard...for the likes o' me?Iris: What?Gina: Well you saw it! That picture.Ryunosuke: What picture?Iris: Ah, you mean this? The photograph taken by Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder. Well, I didn't think it would have captured a scene like this, that's for sure!Gina: It's 'opeless. Anyone who sees that's gonna think I did it, ain't they?Ryunosuke: Well...I won't pretend it wasn't a bit of a shock when the prosecution first presented it to the court.Gina: Surely you've gotta 'ave yer doubts about me now. Ya can't still think I'm innocent.Ryunosuke: ......... Of course I can.Gina: Hmph.........Iris: Ginny...why don't you talk to us? Tell us what really happened that night.Gina: Eh?Iris: Runo's cleverly managed to piece together a lot of new information, but still... ...we'd really like to hear it from you.Gina: ......... Alright then. It was after we'd 'ad that dinner together at your place, right, Iris? Then we all 'ad a chat up in your office, didn't we?Ryunosuke: Yes, I remember.Gina: After that, I just couldn't get to sleep. So I slipped out an' went down the street to the two-to-one. To Windibank's place. ...I 'ad to know.Ryunosuke: If Iris's story was there or not? 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.Gina: I dunno wot it's about or nuffin'... ...but if you ask me, there's somefin' in it that Sholmes don't like. Somefin' wot 'e don't want people readin'. So that's why 'e lied to Iris about stickin' it in lug wiv Windibank for safekeepin'. At least, that's wot I thought at the time.Ryunosuke: So you broke into Windibank's?Gina: I just 'ad to know if it was there or not. I mean, I 'ad no idea all o' that was gonna kick off, did I? I struck the lock and snuck inside. It was dark as you like in there. So I gave the oil lamp on the counter a bit o' wick. And that's when...What d'you think you're doing?!AAAAAAGH!Gina: I nearly died, I did! And the next thing I knew... ...I'd grabbed the gun off the counter and was wavin' it in the air like...I dunno wot.Ah...you're the girl who was in here this afternoon. I didn't think pickpockets went in for armed robbery.The, the mantelscript... 'Ave you got it 'ere? Did Sholmes leave a load o' papers wiv you? A story.Windibank:I beg your pardon?Gina:'The Hound o' the...' somefin'-or-other. If it's 'ere, I wanna see it!Windibank:I'm sorry, young lady... ...but I'd sooner die than relinquish an article belonging to one of my customers.Gina:I don't want it! Wot would I do wiv it anyway? I just...wanna see it's 'ere, that's all.Windibank:Oh, you want to see it, do you?Gina:I wanna know if Sholmes really pawned it 'ere or not. Please! Just let me see it an' I'll go.Windibank:......... Oh, very well then. But for pity's sake, stop waving my gun around, would you?Gina: So then the old cove unlocked the storeroom door, and we both went inside. And it was there alright. The mantelscript. Sholmes weren't lyin' after all.Iris: You did all that just to check for me, Ginny?Gina: ...Anyway, then there was a bit of a kick-up out in the main bit o' the shop.Ryunosuke: The Skulkin brothers arriving on the scene, yes.Gina:Wot was that noise? Someone's breakin' in!Windibank:Dear me, is there some burglars' convention here tonight that I don't know about?Gina:...I think I forgot to shut the door be'ind me. Sorry.Windibank:I'd better go and take care of it. Could I possibly have my gun back?Gina:Oh, well I'll come wiv ya and-Windibank:Now don't be foolish, young girl. You must stay right here. Don't leave this room under any circumstances.Gina: An' wiv that, 'e took the gun out of me 'ands and walked back out into the shop. I 'ung back in the storeroom like 'e said, strainin' me ears in the dark to 'ear wot was goin' on. It sounded like they got into a bit of a scrap. I started to think I should 'elp, see. So I was just about to go out the storeroom myself, when...*BANG!**BANG!*Gina: I 'eard a couple o' shots go off. Two, I think. Almost at the same time. And then there 'e was, right at me feet. Lyin' face down on the floor! I was right next to the storeroom door, so I slammed it shut an' locked it quick as ya like.Ryunosuke: Because you thought whoever had shot Mr Windibank might come for you?Gina: Yeah. So I went to grab the old cove's gun. I figured I'd put up a fight at least. But when I got a better look at 'im, I knew... ...Windibank was a goner. I felt funny in me 'ead all of a sudden. Kind of dizzy. And after that...I don't remember nuffin'.Ryunosuke: That must be when you passed out, Gina.Gina: ......... If...if I 'adn't done wot I done... ...the old cove might still be alive!Ryunosuke: Did you tell the police everything you just told us?Gina: 'Course I did! But they didn't believe a word of it, did they? All they said was, if I kept tellin' lies, it'd make things even worse for me. .........Iris: It'll be alright, Ginny, don't worry. Just stay strong a little longer. Runo's about to put the real culprit through the mill!Gina: ......... That cove wot was there in the afternoon? That Eggert Benedict...I still remember 'ow 'e looked at me. Like I was nuffin'. 'E...'e was there that night.Ryunosuke: We don't know his real name yet... ...but I'm convinced that he's involved somehow.Gina: .........Ryunosuke: Anyway, thank you for telling us what happened, Gina. I appreciate your honesty.Gina: You wot?Iris: You can leave it all in Runo's capable hands now, Ginny!Gina: ......... Mr Narra-'Oddo...Ryunosuke: Yes?Gina: ...'Ow come you trust me? I don't get it.Ryunosuke: .........Gina: I mean, 'ave you forgotten wot 'appened 'ere before? Come on, it was only two months ago. Me and McGilded...we told you a whole pack o' lies. An' you got the bogtrotter off wiv 'em! Even though 'e was a killer!Ryunosuke: ......... No, I could never forget that.Gina: Oh...Ryunosuke: (I did what I thought was best at the time. But the pain of that error of judgement doesn't get any easier to bear.) Still, don't forget that I also made you a promise. I told you that I'd be on your side to the bitter end, no matter what.Gina: But wot if I'm lyin'?! You could be workin' to get another killer off the 'ook for all you know!Ryunosuke: ......... I was once in your position, Gina. I was the accused in a trial.Gina: You were?Ryunosuke: Before I left Japan. I was accused of murder. And strange as it might sound, the circumstances of the crime were pretty damning. I was sure that no one would believe it wasn't me who'd done it.Iris: Oh, Runo...Ryunosuke: But there was one person who stood up for me. Who believed in me, and was prepared to defend me. My best friend.Ryunosuke, no one believes in you more than I do. Leave this to me. All you need to do is put your faith in me, and I'll do the rest!Ryunosuke: I was so happy, I cried. But even then... ...somewhere inside me, I couldn't help thinking: 'Surely he doesn't really believe in me. Not completely.'Gina: ...!Ryunosuke: But...I was wrong.As soon as my trial began, it was obvious... ...that he had an absolute, unwavering belief in me. And in turn, I developed an absolute, unwavering belief in him.Ryunosuke: Since then, I came to realise... ...if you want someone to believe in you, you have to believe in the other person first.Gina: Wot are you sayin'...?Ryunosuke: I promise you, Gina, that no matter what happens, I'll keep believing in you. So you don't need to worry. I won't let you down.Gina: ......... Even though I'm a diver? ...And a no-good liar?Ryunosuke: ......... You're not like McGilded. I know that.Gina: Eh?Iris: That's right! You're our friend, Ginny!Gina: I-Iris!Ryunosuke: We know you better than you think. And we've come to the conclusion that you're someone we can trust.Iris: Yes!Ryunosuke: That's really all we need to know.Iris: Exactly!Gina: Um...Mr Narra-'Oddo, I, um... I... *Sniffle, sniffle*Bailiff: Defendant Gina Lestrade and her legal representative! Court proceedings are about to resume. Please head into the courtroom immediately!Ryunosuke: Yes, of course! Thank you.I'd been both a defendant and a defending lawyer in my time. So I knew only too well... ...just how hard it was to put all your faith in another. And I also knew... ...just how hard it was to bear the burden of another putting all their faith in you. (This is it at last. The final chapter. The final battle. Wish me luck, Susato-san... And I hope you're watching over me too...partner!)17th April, 1:41 p.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: I hereby call this court to order as we resume the trial of Miss Gina Lestrade. Lord van Zieks, have you successfully subpoenaed the witness?Van Zieks: The subpoena was delivered to the communication station where the man works immediately, My Lord. However, the heavy rain has delayed the arrival of his carriage, it would seem.Judge: Hm, I see. Then let us turn our attention to Inspector Gregson's precis of the case heard by the court this morning. The glaring omission of the third bullet in your report is a serious blunder, Inspector.Gregson: Yes, um, I can only apologise, My Lord.Judge: And although the defence's chemical analysis of the blood at the scene makes for a compelling argument... ...I cannot permit such untried methods to be used as evidence in my courtroom.Iris: Hmph! It's a big mistake to cross Hurley and me. A very big mistake!Bailiff: My Lord! The subpoenaed witness has just arrived in the building.Judge: Thank you, Officer. Show him to the stand without delay.Ryunosuke: (Mr Eggert Benedict... I didn't expect to be crossing paths with him again so soon. And certainly not like this.)Judge: Thank you for complying with the court's subpoena at such short notice, sir.???: But of course, My Lord. As an upstanding member of London society, it is my pleasure to oblige.Judge: Now, kindly state your name and occupation for the record.Graydon: Ashley Graydon, communications officer.Juror No. 5: Mr Graydon and I both work at London's central communication station.Graydon: Now perhaps somebody would kindly explain what all this is about?Van Zieks: You were apprised of the situation by the court officer on your way here, I presume.Graydon: Yes, I was. Something to do with a murder that took place at a pawnbroker's on Baker Street. And some nonsense about me having been there on the night in question.Van Zieks: That is the accusation, indeed.Graydon: This really is beyond a joke, you know.Judge: Very well. Without further delay, the court will hear your testimony now, Mr Graydon. You will respond to the accusation made against you under oath.Graydon: Gladly, My Lord. Gladly.Witness Testimony - The Accusation -Graydon: Naturally, I have occasion to make use of pawnbroking services from time to time. But are you seriously suggesting I colluded with these thugs to break into the place on the night of the murder? ...I have no intention of admitting to such an outrageous accusation. Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene. Some scaramouch detective's homebrewed tincture can hardly be taken as serious evidence.Judge: So...you deny the accusation completely, do you?Graydon: I must say, I am dismayed. For the highest court in the land to be swayed by this self-professed detective's toy...Van Zieks: It was the will of the jury. And our great British justice system demands that the jury's will is upheld.Graydon: Then it would seem we have the misfortune of a most inept assembly of jurors today.Juror No. 1: ...! By golly!Graydon: How long am I expected to be detained here?Judge: If, following the defence's cross-examination, your involvement in this matter has not been established... ...you will be free to leave immediately.Graydon: Good. Then I shall be away in time for afternoon tea. Some small consolation at least.Judge: Let us not hold up Mr Graydon any longer than necessary, Counsel. Proceed with the cross-examination.Ryunosuke: So...we meet again, Mr Eggert Benedict. Or is it Mr Graydon?Graydon: ......... My apologies. You are...?Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke Naruhodo, defence lawyer. We have met.Graydon: If you say so. Ashley Graydon. Enchanté. So...Ryunosuke: Agh!Graydon: ...I trust we can conclude this quickly.Ryunosuke: Ugh...

    "cot": "Evidence 3 (\"Gina's Representation Papers\") shows that Gina has signed paperwork allowing Ryunosuke to represent her. Testimony 0-5 are all spoken by Graydon denying involvement in the pawnbrokery murder or any connection to the pawnbrokery. \n\nHowever, Evidence 1 (Music Box Disk) and related testimonies link Graydon (under the alias Eggert Benedict) to the pawnbrokery as he was present there and involved in an incident with the disk. He demanded the return of the overcoat and the music box disk from Gina, and he had a blood injury caused by the disk. Testimony 3 and 4 by Graydon suggest denial of involvement despite physical evidence (blood) tying him to the scene.\n\nSpecifically, Evidence 17 and 18 (Sholmes's Pouch and The Third Bullet) implicate Graydon by proving there was a third shot fired from a gun other than those belonging to the Skulkin brothers and Windibank himself, linking to his presence at the scene.\n\nAmong these, the strongest contradiction is between Evidence 5 (Blood Samples Portfolio), which shows blood at the scene proving the presence of a third person (Graydon), and Testimony 3 by Graydon, where he denies that his blood was found at the scene, calling the detective’s chemical evidence untrustworthy.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction lies between:\n\n- Evidence: Blood Samples Portfolio (Evidence 5) showing blood of Graydon at the scene.\n- Testimony: Graydon denying (Testimony 3) that his blood was found at the scene and dismissing the detection method.\n",

Sholmes' cry pierced through the thick wall of fog around us. Wisps of vapour flowed over the pistol as I cocked it, and I waited breathlessly in the stillness. The silence lasted for what seemed an eternity until, at last, it appeared. From the shadows of the cloud, an enormous beast sprang out upon us. A hound it was, but not such a hound as any mortal has ever seen. Its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, the whole of its ox-sized body was outlined in white-hot flames. Its rumbling pant and hideous howl... So terrified was I that I began to tremble with fear. 'Look well, Wilson!' Sholmes declared, gazing upon the mystical beast. 'For this! This is the diabolical Hound of the Baskervilles!' Our first two months in London passed by in a flash. In that disconcerting courtroom experience we were first thrown into on the day we arrived in the country... ...and in Soseki-san's terrible ordeal that had followed closely behind, we had emerged victorious. However... ...there then came an abrupt end to our opportunities to appear in court. Which was hardly surprising, of course... ...since I was nothing more than an amateur, an unknown student of law from a faraway land. So life in our little office was very quiet. That is... ...until it was shattered one day, by that fateful telegram... 15th April, 9:13 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy *Knock knock knock* That morning... ...I was woken by the unreserved knocking on the door by the telegram boy. But after he'd gone... ...Susato-san's behaviour became very obviously strange. Ryunosuke: Um...Susato-san? Susato: Yes! Is it time to leave for court already? Let me see... What case is it today? Ryunosuke: I...don't think I'm scheduled to defend anyone at the moment, am I? Susato: Oh! No, of course not. How silly of me. Ryunosuke: But I think Iris said she would make us breakfast this morning. So shall we go down to Mr Sholmes's suite? Susato: Yes! Iris makes the most delicious breakfast food. Ryunosuke: She does, doesn't she? Susato: And once our bellies are full, we can leave for court in fighting fit form! Let me see... What case is it today? Ryunosuke: (Here we go again...) 15th April Sholmes's Suite Iris: Morning, Runo! Morning, Susie! Susato: Good morning, Iris! Ryunosuke: Um...Iris... Iris: What is it, Runo? Ryunosuke: What is that terrible noise? It sounds like a cat being strangled. Iris: Ah, yes... You noticed that, did you? Hurley isn't in the best form this morning, it seems. Sholmes: Hello... Susato: Hello...Mr Sholmes. Ryunosuke: G-Good morning. Sholmes: ......... A good morning to die perhaps... Ryunosuke: ...Has something happened, Mr Sholmes? You look miserable, and...the way you were playing the violin before... Sholmes: Hmph. My analytical mind is dead. Music is dead. The world...is dead. Damn this blanched existence! ...That's all it is, my dear fellow. Nothing of consequence. Susato: I'm afraid I don't understand. Sholmes: Well, Iris? Isn't it time we ate? Some dry toast and insipid coffee for me...if it's not too much trouble. ???: Miaow... Ryunosuke: Oh look, it's Wagahai. Susato: Good morning, boy. Wagahai: Miaow. Ryunosuke: ......... (That must be some sort of tiny door for cats to use. But how did it get there?) Iris: Well then, everyone, time for breakfast! Susato: Oh, wonderful! Let me help you, Iris.

Sholmes: What was that? Iris: Oh no! Wagahai's tangled up in your violin! Susato: I think he thinks it's a toy! Ryunosuke: No! (What's he doing to it?!) Susato: Oh dear... Mr Sholmes's precious violin... Sholes: ...Why should I care? Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: I shouldn't be surprised... ...if the cat is a more accomplished musician than I now. Susato: ...Mr Sholmes really is in poor spirits, isn't he? Iris: Well anyway, I'll put it back where it lives, shall I, Hurley? Ryunosuke: Out of the cat's reach, if possible. (Maybe we should assess the damage...) After examining \"violin\" and clearing all Converse options with Iris Wilson: Sholmes: Come, Mr Naruhodo! Dilly-dallying will get you nowhere! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: Crunching your toast with that vacant aspect... Fressing your coffee so obtusely... Are you not a little embarrassed by your own conduct, considering the urgency with which we are faced? Susato: We must visit Mr Windibank's brokery at once! That's right, isn't it, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Precisely, Miss Susato. Without a moment's delay! Ryunosuke: But, but I haven't finished my bacon and eggs... Sholmes: My dear fellow! Surely you do not still intend... ...to crunch your bacon with an increasingly vacant aspect? To fress your egg ever more obtusely? Ryunosuke: Alright, alright, say no more! Let's go then. Iris: Don't worry, Runo, I'd be happy to heat it up for you again later. Ryunosuke: Oh, thank you, Iris. (As it happens, I am rather curious to see what a British pawnbroker's looks like.)

There are all sorts of tools and contraptions in here that I've never laid eyes on before! Ryunosuke: (Ah, Susato-san...and that spark of wonder in your eyes. You can't wait to scour the shelves, can you?) I get the impression you enjoy places like this? Susato: Oh yes! I don't know why, but seeing such a lot of things I don't understand is a real thrill for me! Sholmes: My dear fellows...let us not forget why we are here. Susato: Oh! Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: We are calling on matters of business, not pleasure. Ryunosuke: (And clearly Mr Sholmes means business, too, judging from the spark of fury in HIS eyes.) Windibank: Ah, Mr Sholmes, sir! Welcome back! Sholmes: ...Did you hear that brazen welcome? Ryunosuke: Well, yes. We are potential customers, after all. Sholmes: We are disgruntled customers, Mr Naruhodo. And it's time to inform Mr Windibank of our ire. Come! The fight is afoot! After clearing all Converse options: Windibank: Now then, Mr Sholmes, allow me to return your precious violin. Sholmes: Ah, the very thing! Thank you, Mr Windibank. Windibank: Perhaps this might mark the end of the peculiar items you try to pop, hm? Because if anything were to happen to one of them... ...this would be the only answer! Ryunosuke: Um, I really think you ought to stop waving that gun around. Someone could get hurt. Windibank: Fear not! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Windibank: I've only loaded a single bullet, so no one but myself could possibly be harmed! Ryunosuke: (That's...not really what I meant.) Sholmes: Good day to you then, Mr Windibank. Windibank: It's been a pleasure as always, Mr Sholmes! Susato: So, Mr Naruhodo! Now we can explore at last!

Down and out, like the rest of us? Nuffin' to eat? Come to pop that black weasel - sorry, 'coat' - 'ave ya? Ryunosuke: (...What is it about this black uniform that makes everyone comment on it?) Sholmes: Ah, good day. Unless I'm much mistaken... ...you would be the young pickpocket who stole our experimental smoke grenade launcher. Gina: Agh! Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: So...you have something of value to pawn, do you? Allow me to see the article, and I shall negotiate with Mr Windibank on your behalf. Gina: Pull the other one! I don't need no 'elp from some stuck-up dee! Get outta my business! Go on, or I'll make trouble for ya! Sholmes: As you wish, Miss Lestrade. I will happily remove myself from your presence. Ryunosuke: (He's really done it. He's gone.) Windibank: I'm sorry, but as I said, there really is no room for negotiation here. Ryunosuke: (What is that thing he has in his hand? Some kind of metal disk?) Gina: And you! Go on! Leave me alone! Susato: Oh, Miss Lestrade, just pretend we aren't here. We shan't be offended in the slightest. Gina: ......... Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: (Susato-san can really stand her ground when she wants to.) Gina: Wotever...

Ryunosuke: (Who's this picture-postcard English gentleman?) ???: Good day to you, ladies. Gentlemen. Gina: Wot's your problem, eh? ???: There is no problem, as long as you remove yourself. I've a matter to discuss with the proprietor. Gina: ...! ???: And if you intend to make a problem of it, I shall see you outside, little girl, for the hiding you deserve. Gina: Look, ain't it obvious? I ain't done talkin' wiv 'im yet. If you think yer such a gent, you should know 'ow to wait in line. ???: ......... Well, you are an impudent little brat, aren't you? ...As well as a pickpocket. Gina: Eh? Who, who are you? 'Ow d'you know who I am? ???: The question is, how do YOU not know who I am? You haven't the courtesy even to remember the faces of your victims, it seems. Gina: ...! Wot?! You mean I...? From you...? ???: Broker! Windibank: Um, yes, sir? ???: I believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemd an article from you, no? Windibank: Yes, yes, erm... ???: The article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once. Susato: Oh my! Gina: Now that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull? ???: Give me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box disks, too. Gina: No! You, you can't 'ave it! You just can't! It's me old man's! Or it was! ...Now it's mine! Susato: Goodness, Mr Naruhodo... ...this is a very awkward situation. Ryunosuke: Yes... I think perhaps we should hear both sides of the story in a little more detail. After clearing all Converse options with Gina Lestrade and \"Eggert Benedict\": Windibank: So, let that be an end to the matter. And thank you for your custom, Mr Eggert Benedict, sir. Benedict: With such reasonable rates of interest...I may even decide to come back. Gina: ......... Tsk! This is why I 'ate grown-ups! Just cos I'm a diver, everyone thinks that makes me a liar. Benedict: And the contents of the coat pockets, if you please, broker. Windibank: But of course, sir. Here is the disk for you. Benedict: ......... Just this one? Windibank: Pardon, sir? Benedict: I was expecting another. Er, that is...I deposited another. Ryunosuke: (Another disk?) Windibank: Oh, um... Oh dear. I regret to inform you, sir, that what was deposited with me was merely the overcoat. The disk happened to be in one of the pockets, but I was completely unaware of it until now. Benedict: So, gutterling... You're hiding more of what's rightfully mine, are you? Gina: Says who, eh? I don't know nuffin' about it! Benedict: ......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style. Gina: Wait a minute! That disk... ...is mine! Benedict: Argh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal! Susato: Oh my! Yes! There's blood on the disk! Ryunosuke: (It's because of all those sharp little bumps! The man must have scratched his finger on them.) Gina: I found it first, alright! I mean! It belonged to me old man! So yer not 'avin' it! ...Oi, you! You take it! Ryunosuke: Me? Gina: If I 'ang onto it, they'll 'ave it off me again. So you keep 'old of it. Ryunosuke: Miss Lestrade, I... (Why is this disk so important to her?) The music box disc has been entered into the Court Record. Benedict: You there! In the black livery! Hand that disk to me at once, please. Gina: No! Don't! He's lyin'! Grown-ups are all liars! Ryunosuke: (Ugh... What do I do now? How am I going to resolve this?) Ryunosuke: Erm...Mr Sholmes... ...what are you examining with such keen interest there? As you enjoy a bar of caramel, I see. Sholmes: ......... So... ...you've found me at last...Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: After that young pickpocket sent me on my way, I was forced to lurk in the shadows. Cruelly ostracised, as the rest of you partook in the jovial atmosphere of fellowship. I had nothing to occupy my mind, but was too ashamed to let society see what my downfall had done to me. So feigning mock interest, I pretended to examine the tedious trinkets in this desolate place. ...Whilst, as you shrewdly observed, gnawing on the only friend I have left: this seven per cent solution of caramel. Pray, do you claim to understand the depths of my despair, Mr Naruhodo? But how could you?! I was so lonely... So desperately lonely... Ryunosuke: Then...why on earth didn't you rejoin the conversation? Things have gone from bad to worse here, you know! Sholmes: Yes...I overheard much of your conversation. Or rather...in my craving for human contact, my ears devoured every word that was uttered! Ryunosuke: ...You really were sad, weren't you? Susato: Poor Mr Sholmes. I feel simply awful for you. Sholmes: It would seem... ...that my inferences are correct. Susato: Oh! ...Surely you're not about to tell us... ...that you've solved the entire case once again?! Sholmes: My dear madam, sometimes I wonder... Were my genius for deduction to be commoditised... ...how much could I pawn it for? Ryunosuke: (It seems Mr Sholmes has had another of his flashes of inspiration. But who knows if it will help to resolve the situation between Miss Lestrade and the mysterious gentleman? What's the right thing to do here...?) Sholmes: Well, Miss Lestrade...it would appear you find yourself in something of a predicament. Gina: Tsk! Where the blue blazes 'ave you been, eh? Sholmes: Pardon? Gina: When a lady's in trouble, a true gent's s'posed to be there to 'elp. Straight away! Not an 'our later! Ryunosuke: (...Harsh.) Benedict: And who, pray tell, are you? Sholmes: ......... Mr Eggert Benedict... ...you have, in my eyes, a veritably encyclopaedic array of curiosities about your person. Nevertheless, there are two immovable conclusions I have drawn. Benedict: I beg your pardon? Sholmes: The first is this: The true reason for your visit to this pawnbrokery today is something you have not yet revealed. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: And the second is this: A considerable crime is in contemplation. One you will orchestrate, with intent to steal a vast sum of money. Well, Mr Benedict? What say you to my deductions? Benedict: How...! Ryunosuke: (He's turned as white as a hard-boiled egg!) Susato: It would seem that once again...Mr Sholmes has made a flawless deduction! Benedict: Just who do you think you are, sir? Sholmes: Ah yes, as I hoped... That is precisely the pained expression I was looking for. So...shall we begin? The time has come for yet another Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! The Great DeductionThe game is afoot! Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Sholmes: First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! The piece of paper in your hand is a 'staff wanted' advertisement from this very shop. Yet even the most unobservant would soon realise that a man of your appearance has no need of such employ. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction. Benedict: What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years! Sholmes: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. The end of any walking cane would be terminated with a metal ferrule to protect the wooden tip. And yet detailed analysis shows the wooden tip of this stick to be utterly bare. Therefore...there is only one conclusion: The rod that you hold in your hand, which appears to be a walking cane... ...is in fact no cane at all! Benedict: ...! Sholmes: You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong? Benedict: I... Well, I... Sholmes: And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear? Benedict: ......... Sholmes: Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. From the moment I saw it, my suspicions were aroused. 'What walking cane demands such a stout handle?' mused I. Benedict: ......... Sholmes: But of course, as I said, this is no walking cane. No, that rod... ...is the broken handle of a shovel! Benedict: Wha...? Are you insane?! Sholmes: And now, having determined this undeniable truth, the conclusion is clear. Your true motive for coming here... ...was to take employment at this establishment in order to excavate the ground beneath the premises! What a calculated crime you have conceived, sir. A wickedly calculated crime. Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery Topic 2 Great Crime Sholmes: Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning. Benedict: This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, intend to excavate the ground beneath this pawnbrokery with a broken shovel? What on earth do you propose I could expect to find there? Some long-forgotten treasure, I suppose? Save for such a fanciful theory, what possible reason could I have to do as you say? Sholmes: Oh, but there is ample reason... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped. Benedict: What? Sholmes: Let us consider what would motivate a man to infiltrate a shop such as this and covertly dig beneath its floor... The answer is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. This letter gives notice of public works to be carried out in the local area. And according to the enclosed plan of the upcoming sewerage works... ...beneath this shop runs a sewer that adjoins another, one that runs under the bank on the opposite side of the road. Benedict: This madness has entered the sewers now, has it?! Sholmes: By excavating the ground beneath our feet, you would gain access to the waterway... ...that flows in very close proximity to the great vault of the financial institution opposite. Benedict: What are you...? Sholmes: In summary, sir... ...you devised a master plan to pull off an elaborate bank robbery by dint of the underground tunnels! Benedict: M... Master plan?! Sholmes: Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... With what plunder did the thief hope to make off from the underground vault of the bank? Benedict: Are you quite serious? Sholmes: Having consulted with Scotland Yard some days ago, I happen to know the answer. But naturally, the answer is no secret to you, is it, Mr Benedict? Benedict: I have no idea what you're talking about! Sholmes: Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know. Benedict: A postcard of the Great Exhibition? I'm afraid you've quite lost me. Sholmes: Currently in the final stages of preparation, the Great Exhibition will soon be underway. And the government has provided extra funds to complete its centrepiece, the Crystal Tower. Funds that currently sit in the vault of the bank on the other side of this road! Benedict: Pardon? Sholmes: Yes, the considerable crime you have been contemplating... ...is the theft of that which sits in the vault of that bank, the special reserve funds for the Great Exhibition! ...Of course, that is top-secret police information. So keep it under your hat, please. Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this pawnbroking puzzle! Ryunosuke: Um...Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: Well, Mr Naruhodo? An impressively upbeat deduction for a detective racked with loneliness, would you not agree? Ryunosuke: Was it true what you said about the bank over the road and what it has in its vault? Sholmes: Indeed. Though few know of its existence. It is one of the government's most closely guarded secrets. Gregson told me, in the strictest confidence. Susato: But you just announced it to everyone here. Rather loudly, in fact. Sholmes: ...Ah. Ryunosuke: And if it's such a big secret... ...how would Mr Benedict have come to find out about it? Sholmes: There can be but one explanation for that. Clearly it is because the man is a criminal! Susato: But what if he didn't know anything about the money in the vault? If he is a criminal, as you said... ...then buying a brand new shovel is sure to be the first thing he does now that you've revealed the secret. Sholmes: ...Oh. Ryunosuke: Or if he doesn't... ...maybe Mr Windibank will. He already has plenty of shovels here, after all. Windibank: Oh my life! I assure you I'm not so unscrupulous! Sholmes: Hm, well... Hopefully this has taught you a valuable lesson. Sensitive information must be handled with the utmost of care. One can never be sure that someone privy to secrets won't disclose them. And once the word is out, it's out. Ryunosuke: ...Perhaps I'll think twice before confiding in you next time, Mr Sholmes. Sholmes: An excellent idea, Mr Naruhodo. An excellent idea. Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Susato: Well then, Mr Naruhodo, you know what to do, I'm sure. Ryunosuke: Yes. Let's listen to that great deduction again, and see if we can massage it into shape! Sholmes: Very well, then. Let us start once more from the beginning... ...of Herlock Sholmes's magnificent 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! Course CorrectionHold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery Sholmes: First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! Ryunosuke: So, by Mr Sholmes's reasoning... ...Mr Benedict came here in order to apply for a job so he could dig down through the floor. Susato: Yes. In an attempt to tunnel into the sewers to gain access to the money in the vault of the bank across the road. But...he wouldn't get very far with a broken shovel, would he? Ryunosuke: No. I think it's fair to say his motives lie elsewhere. The question is, where? What did bring Mr Benedict here at this particular point in time? Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! Susato: I still don't quite understand why this gentleman came to Mr Windibank's today. Ryunosuke: He might look like a smartly dressed man about town, but perhaps he's destitute really. I really think that's the only explanation! Susato: We must stop thinking along those lines, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Yes...I suppose you're right. Well in that case... ...perhaps there's something in this pawn shop that the man was looking for? Susato: Let's look closely and see if there's anything about his person that gives us a clue. Ryunosuke: Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the info about Miss Lestrade! Sholmes: Quite so, my dear fellow! It would appear that the writing and sketch on the reverse of the flyer... ...pertain to the pickpocket, Miss Lestrade, and to Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery here. Benedict: Ah! Ryunosuke: You originally told us... ...that you had merely given chase after Miss Lestrade stole the redemption ticket from you. Sholmes: But that, sir, is a thinly veiled lie. Ryunosuke: It is the information on the back of the flyer that led you here today. By which I mean... Here, to Windibank's Pawnbrokery, and today, the redemption deadline of that overcoat. Sholmes: So you waited outside for the young girl matching the description you have written down to arrive. Benedict: Hmph! Sholmes: And you have gone to some lengths to hide the reason for your pursuit of Miss Lestrade. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction. Benedict: What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years! Sholmes: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. Ryunosuke: Um...what's a ferrule? Susato: It's the metal cap commonly found on the end of a cane, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Ah, the bit that makes the nice clacking sound on the pavement? Susato: Yes, exactly, And Mr Sholmes is right, it appears to be missing on this cane. Ryunosuke: ...But it doesn't actually look broken, does it? Susato: No, it doesn't. Though the gentleman certainly did recoil when Mr Sholmes identified the cane as suspicious. Ryunosuke: In other words... ...there's some secret about the cane that Mr Benedict would rather we don't know! The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. Ryunosuke: I don't know, I just can't picture it. I mean, a respectable gentleman strolling the streets of London with a shovel in his hand? (I'm sure it's just that the cane is broken and the ferrule was lost somehow.) Susato: Well, there is one thing of which we can be certain in all of this. After all, we saw it with our own eyes. At the mention of his cane, Mr Benedict visibly recoiled. Ryunosuke: ...! (That's very true. So there's definitely something about this cane that's not right...) Ryunosuke: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the initialling. Sholmes: A most astute observation...wouldn't you say, Mr Eggert Benedict? Benedict: ...! Sholmes: We are led to believe, sir, that your initials are 'E. B.'. Yet in a most possessive manner, you have in your grasp a cane bearing the initials 'A. G.'. An incontrovertible contradiction indeed, would you not agree? Benedict: No! You're, you're wrong. This cane isn't- Ryunosuke: You said before that you'd had that cane for years. Benedict: Grrr... Ryunosuke: So don't try to tell us that you just borrowed it from a friend or found it in the park! Sholmes: In short... ...though you hold yourself to be a gentleman, you have withheld your true name! Benedict: ...! Sholmes: You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong? Benedict: I... Well, I... Sholmes: And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear? Benedict: ......... Sholmes: Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Ryunosuke: Let's consider the bare bones of what's happened here: Miss Lestrade redeemed that fine-looking overcoat. And now a mysterious man has appeared, introducing himself with a fake name... ...and claiming that the overcoat belongs to him. Susato: But we know that he actually identified Miss Lestrade from a written description. Which suggests that everything else he's told us is untrue. Ryunosuke: So what we need to do here... ...is somehow prove that the overcoat cannot possibly belong to him! The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Ryunosuke: The man is white all over, but for his overcoat. That's almost reason enough to say it doesn't belong to him, isn't it? Susato: But I'm sure the gentleman's wardrobe isn't exclusively white, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Well mine is exclusively black! Susato: ...I think perhaps we should go shopping together. Ryunosuke: (There's no doubt about it. That black overcoat doesn't suit Mr Benedict at all. But we need a more tangible way of proving it...) Ryunosuke: The split seam, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Benedict: Ah! Sholmes: Yes, because the overcoat is rather obviously a poor fit. Ryunosuke: Having forced it over your broad shoulders, the seam is already breaking apart. Sholmes: My suspicions were aroused from the outset... ...when you so baldly lied about your name and so boldly waylaid this pickpocket. Benedict: Argh! Sholmes: This catalogue of untruths has all been for one very specific purpose: To steal the article that the young girl redeemed from Mr Windibank! Benedict: AAAAAARGH!!! Sholmes: But what really irks me is this: The considerable crime I initially imagined has been considerably curtailed. Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery To abscond with a redeemed item Solved Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds Sholmes: Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning. Benedict: This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, designed a wheeze to filch some tawdry article of pawnage? Have you forgotten that I redeemed the article in the proper manner, using the watchword? Had I not been the one to deposit it in the first place... ...how could I possibly have known the relevant details? N'est-ce pas? Sholmes: Oh, but the watchword can be discovered... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped. Benedict: What? Sholmes: Let us consider how one might come to learn a secret watchword relating to the pawned property of another... The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Susato: The direction of the deduction must change rather dramatically now, I think. Ryunosuke: Yes, no more talk of tunnelling into the sewers. (Which is a pity, because it all sounded rather exciting.) Anyway... ...you can't deny that this mysterious gentleman did know the watchword. Susato: Yes. 'Professor'... If you didn't know that word, Mr Windibank would never allow you to redeem the article. Ryunosuke: Or, looking at it another way... ...if you did know that word, Mr Windibank would allow you to redeem the article whether it was yours or not. (So the question is, could this gentleman have found the watchword out somehow?) The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Ryunosuke: There's no question that Mr Benedict used some wheeze or other to find out the watchword. (Let's think. He only appeared in the shop after Miss Lestrade had redeemed the overcoat...) Susato: He certainly couldn't have overheard Miss Lestrade saying the watchword. So he can only have discovered it from something on this countertop. Ryunosuke: (It sounds like I need to have another look and examine things more closely this time.) Ryunosuke: The method is revealed by the notelet on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Sholmes: Yes, the broker here follows the same procedure whenever a customer comes to redeem an article. He asks the customer for the watchword, and notes down the response uttered on a notelet he has to hand. Then he consults his ledger, and confirms whether or not the watchword matches that of the article in question. Benedict: I would expect nothing less of a diligent pawnbroker. Ryunosuke: But his diligence clearly has its disadvantages. Benedict: What are you talking about? Sholmes: It is increasingly apparent that you were present in this shop before your accusation against Miss Lestrade. Ryunosuke: In all likelihood, you followed her inside, and then observed her talking to Mr Windibank. Sholmes: When the diligent broker made a note of the watchword, as is his common practice... Ryunosuke: ...You observed him writing the word 'Professor' on the notelet beside the ledger. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: And that, sir... ...was the master plan you devised to steal the pawned article from the young Miss Lestrade! Benedict: M... Master plan?! Sholmes: Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... Why would you go to such lengths to redeem that particular article from this pawnbroker? Benedict: Are you quite serious? Sholmes: For an ill-fitting overcoat hardly seems to justify the effort, much less a worthless music box disk. But naturally, you had very good reason to make them yours, didn't you, Mr Benedict? Benedict: I have no idea what you're talking about! Sholmes: Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know. Ryunosuke: The articles we're talking about are the overcoat and the music box disk that was in one of the pockets. Susato: Which according to Mr Windibank, isn't even worth a penny. Ryunosuke: And yet this man went to such lengths to steal them... Why? Susato: I wonder if perhaps... ...we already have the evidence we need to explain it, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: (Could we? Really? I'd better have a thorough look through all the evidence we've collected so far.) Ryunosuke: You see, this music box disk tells us all we need to know. Benedict: What's that...on the back...? Sholmes: It reads, 'For McGilded'... Benedict: Agh! Sholmes: Ah, Mr Magnus McGilded... The unfortunate philanthropist who perished in curious circumstances at the Old Bailey two months ago. A prominent man in London...though his loan-mongering demonstrated a distinct lack of scruples. So...you're an associate of his, are you? Or perhaps a subordinate? Benedict: ......... Ryunosuke: Mr McGilded was a man of unusually small stature. In fact... ...he was precisely the right size for that overcoat that you've squeezed yourself into. Benedict: Ugh! Sholmes: Your true identity remains shrouded in mystery... Mr Eggert Benedict. But the final conclusion here is crystal clear. The reason you came to this pawnbrokery today... ...was to retrieve an article left behind by the late Magnus McGilded! Benedict: Tsk... AAAAAAAAARGH!!! Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds To acquire an item deposited by Mr McGilded Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Sholmes: Well well, Mr Magnus McGilded... Not a name I expected to hear in these circumstances. Benedict: ......... Susato: Mr Sholmes, I'm afraid there's something very troubling on my mind. Sholmes: Pray tell, Miss Susato. Susato: Well, according to what Mr Windibank told us earlier... ...today was the final day on which the coat could have been redeemed, was it not? Windibank: Yes, ma'am, that is correct. Today would be precisely two months since it was first deposited. Ryunosuke: Well, today is 15th April, so...two months ago today... Windibank: ...Would have been 15th February, sir, that's right. It's all carefully recorded in my ledger. Deposited at 10:30 p.m., I see. Ryunosuke: What?! But, but that suggests... Susato: Yes. 15th February... Ryunosuke: ...Is precisely the day on which the omnibus murder took place! Susato: And half past ten in the evening... ...is precisely the time at which the terrible events were unfolding! Sholmes: Suggestive is not the word. It would seem the matter is entirely beyond coincidence. Benedict: ......... You are of course at liberty to make whatever outlandish deductions you choose. However... ...I must insist you hand over the music box disk now. Ryunosuke: ...! Benedict: It would be a terrible shame to return to your native land in a box. Ryunosuke: Agh... (What do I do?!) Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank! Windibank: This is my shop! I can't allow any harm to come to my customers! If that were to happen... ...I should have to take my own life! Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank, no! ???: Alright, that's enough! Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson! Benedict: Inspector...? Gregson: That's right, sunshine. The alarm was raised on one of our dedicated emergency lines. So we got here as fast as we could. Now, what's this all about, eh? Windibank: Oh, praise be! You're here at last! I was moments away from forfeiting my own life in my very own establishment! Benedict: ......... It would seem you have the upper hand. Gregson: Right, you lot have got some explainin' to do! I don't appreciate bein' bothered with some petty argy-bargy! Susato: Petty?! Mr Windibank very nearly met with his end! Gregson: Yeah, with his own gun, as far as I can tell. Windibank: Oh dear... Gregson: And the whole of Britain could meet with its end if I don't get to the bottom of the case I'm s'posed to be workin' on! Ryunosuke: What?! What on earth is the case, Inspector? Sholmes: Spare no detail, Gregson! Gregson: ...I, I might have said a little too much. No matter. It's nothin' to do with you lot. Anyway, sir, you're gonna have to come with me down to the station. Benedict: ......... But of course, Inspector... Gregson: Aah! He's getting away! Get after him, lads! Whistle the beat officer, too!Sir! Gregson: ...There's been a spate of thefts at pawn shops round here recently. So we've fitted emergency buttons underneath the counters for brokers to let us know when there's trouble. Windibank: Oh, Inspector...I was very worried there for a while. Very worried indeed. Gregson: Now then, Mr Permanently-in-Mournin'... Ryunosuke: Oh! ...Yes? Gregson: I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over! Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, of course... Gina: No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine! Gregson: I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now. Ryunosuke: As evidence...? Sholmes: If the police demand something as evidence, my dear fellow, we have no choice but to capitulate. It's all yours, Inspector. Gina: Grrr... Ryunosuke: And so, we handed Mr McGilded's disk over to Inspector Gregson... ...and were summarily turfed out of the shop and onto the street. To be continued...

All they do is feed you a pack o' lies and take stuff away from ya! Sholmes: Oh really, Miss Lestrade? ...Tell me, is that overcoat keeping you warm? Gina: Wot? Susato: Oh my! Surely, you were given that! Gina: Yeah, the dee let me keep it. After I looked daggers at 'im for long enough. 'E went through the pockets and then said, 'Go on, then, 'ave it' before tellin' me to scarper. Always pays off, givin' people a look like you 'ate 'em.

Ryunosuke: But Mr Windibank said it was practically worthless. Gina: I think I'm gonna go and 'ave another bash. Give 'em a long, 'ard stare. Sholmes: I think not, Miss Lestrade. We shan't enter Windibank's again today. Gina: Why not?! That's not fair! Ryunosuke: It can't be helped, I'm afraid. The police are investigating the scene now, and taking a statement from Mr Windibank. Gina: But that disk's mine! I 'ad the ticket for this coat, and it was in this coat's pocket! And there should be somefin' else an' all! That's wot that rotten cove said, ain't it? Ryunosuke: Yes, he did mention something about another article, didn't he? Gina: Well then, that's mine, too! Wotever it is! Ryunosuke: (Now she's really pushing her luck...) Sholmes: Miss Lestrade, I think it's time to admit defeat. You've had your 'haul' for the day. Gina: Yeah! And it's all your fault, Sholmes! Sholmes: So what are your plans now? Will you dine with us this evening? Gina: Eh? Sholmes: Iris would be delighted to cook, I'm sure. And I might entertain you with a modest violin recital. Gina: ......... No, ta. Sholmes: Oh... Gina: Why would I come round your place, eh? 'Ave you lost your 'ead or somefin'?! Susato: Oh dear. She's gone. Sholmes: Hm, having reviled on me quite unnecessarily, I might add. Ryunosuke: I...can't help wondering... ...if perhaps she might turn up anyway. Sholmes: Interesting... Ryunosuke: Once she's had a chance to calm down, I think there's a good chance she'll decide to come. Sholmes: ......... Very well, then. I'll inform Iris to set a place for our potential guest at the dinner table this evening. And one more thing... I should be glad of your company later, too. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: I believe I will have a rather splendid surprise to show you. Susato: Oh, how exciting! What is it? Sholmes: You shall have to wait and see, Miss Susato. ...Until later, then! 15th April, 3:46 p.m. Sholmes's Suite Iris: Ah, Susie! And Runo! Come in, come in! Ryunosuke: Good afternoon, Iris. Susato: Thank you so much for breakfast this morning. Iris: Oh, don't mention it! ...Goodness! Look at the time already! Ryunosuke: Busy as always? Iris: I am! I'm preparing everything for dinner this evening. Ryunosuke: Already? You're obviously cooking something special, are you? Iris: Oh, yes! After all, we have a special guest joining us! Guess who it is! Go on! Hee hee, you'll never guess! Ryunosuke: Um... (Look at those little eyes of hers shining!) Susato: Oh dear. It is awkward when you already know the answer, isn't it? Iris: It's Ginny! Isn't that exciting?! Susato: Oh! Oh...what a surprise! Yes, that's wonderful news! Ryunosuke: (Wow, Iris seems overjoyed at the idea!) Iris: I can't wait to learn some pickpocketing tips from a real professional! Ryunosuke: Oh yes! That does sound like fun! Susato: I'm not sure that's entirely appropriate. Are you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Erm... By the way, Iris, what's Mr Sholmes up to? Iris: Hurley? Oh, he's been like that ever since he got back. Ryunosuke: ...Hellooo! Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: I beg that you won't speak to me. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: I don't know who you are, but kindly take your leave. As you can see, I'm not here. Ryunosuke: ......... (I, I don't know how to respond to that.) Iris: I do apologise. When he gets like this, he's completely oblivious to everything. Ryunosuke: Yes... I see... Iris: Really, he behaves just like a child sometimes, Hurley does. Susato: Mr Sholmes and Iris have something of a parent-and-child relationship, don't they? Ryunosuke: Yes, except that Iris is clearly the parent here... (Come to think of it... ...I wonder where her real parents are.) Iris: What's the matter, Runo? You have ever such a funny look on your face! Ryunosuke: Oh...no...it's nothing. Iris: I know what it is! 'Why does this girl live here with Mr Sholmes?' you're wondering. ...Am I right? Ryunosuke: How?! How did you...? Iris: Heh heh, oh, Runo! I can read you like a book! Ryunosuke: (Ugh... This girl is dangerous...) Iris: Don't worry, you can ask me anything! I won't mind. After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Ah, my dear fellows! How good to see you! Susato: Eek! Mr, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Whyever did you not make your presence known to me before? Ryunosuke: ...Haah. Sholmes: Well, no matter now. So, how the devil are you? Ryunosuke: We've...been with you for most of the day. Sholmes: Goodness, really? Susato: Do tell me, Mr Sholmes, is your violin unscathed? Sholmes: Hm? My violin? Whatever are you talking about, dear madam? Susato: Oh! Um... Sholmes: Never mind that now. I have something far more interesting to show you. Behold, my dear fellows! Susato: Oh, another music box disk. Sholmes: No, not 'another' disk, Miss Susato. This is the one Gregson demanded we hand over as evidence: Mr McGilded's disk! Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: Then, then...what's it doing here?! Sholmes: Heh heh heh! You know, at times, Mr Naruhodo... ...I think that though I have an undeniable turn for detection... ...I may well be even more adept at larceny! Iris: Ooh! That would be wonderfully exciting! I'd be your pickpocketing assistant! And Runo could be our go-to lawyer if we ever got caught! Ryunosuke: Right... Iris: Plus, Susie has such beautiful handwriting, she could write all our menacing crime notifications! Susato: Yes! I'd be delighted! Ryunosuke: (I'm just going to pretend this conversation never happened, I think.) After clearing all Converse options: Iris: Well, it's time I started getting things ready for dinner, I think. Ginny will be here before long. Sholmes: Thank you, Iris. Susato: Oh, well you must let me help you, then. Iris: Of course, Susie! There's plenty to do. Sholmes: I think I shall investigate the condition of my faithful performing partner. Now then...where did I leave it...? Ryunosuke: Let this be a lesson to you, Mr Sholmes: Never leave anything too precious with the pawnbroker. Sholmes: Hm, yes... You may be right. Susato: Oh, that reminds me! Of something Mr Windibank said before. He said that he had a manuscript of Iris's in pawn, didn't he? Sholmes: Did he? Ryunosuke: Yes, he definitely mentioned it. 'Mr Sholmes's latest tale of otherworldly mystery lies dormant in my storeroom,' were his words, I believe. Iris: So you heard about that, did you? I expect you were as incensed as I was! Susato: Oh yes! The idea of such a wonderful story languishing in Mr Windibank's storeroom, gathering dust... Sholmes: My dear madam, I'm quite sure I told you already... ...the pawnbroker's storeroom is the safest place for it. More secure than a bank's vault! Iris: And what about your Stradivarius, Hurley? Was that safe and secure? Sholmes: Weeell... There may be the occasional mix-up. Ryunosuke: (Caused by a certain impetuous someone not too far from me now...) Iris: Do you have any idea how long it took me to write that Baskerville story, Hurley? Susato: Oh, it sounds so exciting! 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'! I should love to read it! Iris: ......... Sholmes: ......... Susato: .........Ah! Ryunosuke: ......... (What's going on here? Why does it feel like an icy chill just swept through the room?) Iris: Susie...what did you just say? Susato: Erm... Iris: You said...'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... But...how could you know the full title? Susato: Well, that's... ......... Ryunosuke: That's because Miss Susato is such a great fan of all the stories about Mr Sholmes, of course. Iris: But Runo, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... ...has never been published. Ryunosuke: What? Iris: When I showed Hurley the manuscript, he told me that I wasn't allowed to publish it yet. Ryunosuke: I don't understand... Iris: That's why he said that he'd keep it safe. Until it was the right time for the story to be made public, you see. Ryunosuke: So that's why the manuscript is at Windibank's...? Iris: And yet, how could Susie here know its title? Well Hurley? What's going on? Sholmes: ......... ...Ah! Ryunosuke: ...? What is it, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: It would appear our guest has arrived. Ryunosuke: Miss Lestrade! Gina: ......... ...This was a bad idea. I knew I weren't welcome. I'm goin'! Ryunosuke: No! Wait! ...Miss Lestrade! We've all been eagerly awaiting your arrival. ...Haven't we, Iris? Iris: ......... Oh yes! Just wait there, Ginny. We'll have everything ready in a jiffy! Come along, Susie! Susato: Right! Of course! It's a pleasure to see you here, Miss Lestrade. Please, make yourself at home! Sholmes: Don't stand in the doorway, my dear girl. Come along in! What say you to some Mendelssohn? I won't take 'no' for an answer! Ryunosuke: ...Meddlesome it is, then. Gina: ......... Wagahai: ...Miaow. Ryunosuke: That evening... ...Iris prepared us all a meal that was even more delicious than usual... ...Mr Sholmes's violin performance was in no way meddlesome... ...and Gina, as we came to call her, taught us all how to steal things from one another without being noticed. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves...well into the night. 15th April, 9:34 p.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Ryunosuke: That was a very enjoyable evening, wasn't it? Susato: Oh yes! Iris's cooking was truly divine! Ryunosuke: And I feel as though I can still hear the enchanting strains of Mr Sholmes's violin even now. Susato: Best of all...I bet I could steal the glasses from His Lordship's face next time we're in court! ......... Naruhodo-san...could I consult with you about something, I wonder? Ryunosuke: What's the matter, Susato-san? Susato: ......... It's...about the telegram I received. Ryunosuke: Ah... (The one that arrived first thing this morning, I suppose.) Susato: ......... I've...I've been summoned. Ryunosuke: What?! Summoned? ...What do you mean? Susato: The telegram was from the Lord Chief Justice's office. Lord Stronghart has asked to see me. Ryunosuke: The Lord Chief Justice? ...When? Susato: Tomorrow morning. Ryunosuke: What?! Then, then we have to start preparing at once! Susato: Oh! No...that won't be necessary, Naruhodo-san. I've been summoned alone. Ryunosuke: Alone? What on earth for? Susato: ......... I have no idea. I suppose I shall find out tomorrow. Ryunosuke: (What's all this about? Whatever it is, it's making me feel very uneasy...) *Knock knock* Ryunosuke: (Oh, who could that be, I wonder?) Iris: Good evening, friends! Ryunosuke: Ah, Iris. Hello again. Gina: ......... Susato: And Gina, too. Iris: Yes! Ginny's going to stay with us tonight. She's going to sleep in with me! ...Isn't that right, Ginny? Gina: Well...yeah... Susato: How lovely! Let me make a pot of tea. Iris: You know, I've learnt so much today! Susato: Oh, what...in particular? Iris: All those things Ginny showed us! Wasn't it wonderful? Ryunosuke: Ah, you mean all those pickpocketing techniques? We had fun trying them out on each other, didn't we? Iris: I think I've awakened a natural talent! I could earn a living from it! Ryunosuke: (...You might be getting ahead of yourself a little there.) So...what brings you up to our humble quarters at this late hour? Iris: Well, you see... ...I came to return this. Ryunosuke: Wait, what?! That's, that's mine! Susato: Oh my! However did you...? Iris: I told you, didn't I? I have a natural talent for it! Ryunosuke: (Oh yes, I'd forgotten... ...Iris literally is a child genius.) Iris: So anyway, here...you can have it back. Not that I really understand why you wear it, though. Ryunosuke: Ah. Thank you. Iris: Alright then, good night! Ryunosuke: Yes, good night. Iris: ......... Hm... So this is your office, is it? What do you think, Ginny? Gina: I think I wouldn't fancy me chances wiv a lawyer wot lives in a place like this. Iris: Yes! Me too! Hahahaha! Ryunosuke: (It seems as though Iris here... ...still has something she'd like to talk about.) Susato: I suppose...she probably wants to talk about the manuscript. Ryunosuke: (Yes, I suppose she probably does.) After clearing all Converse options with Iris Wilson and Gina Lestrade: Iris: Oh my goodness! Look at the time! Come along, Ginny, we should go back downstairs. Gina: Yeah...alright. Iris: And please, don't mention any of this to Hurley, will you? Ryunosuke: No...of course not. Good night then, Iris. Good night, Gina. Susato: You must let me make breakfast for you tomorrow morning! I insist! Iris: Oh, yes please! I can't wait, Susie! Good night, then! Ryunosuke: (Iris... It sure is easy to forget, isn't it? Sometimes she speaks just like an adult. But deep down, she's still just a child.) Susato: Well, I think it's time that I turned in for the night, too, Naruhodo-san. Ryunosuke: Dr John H. Wilson... Iris's father... But also... ...the name of the murdered visiting professor at Yumei University. It can't be a mere coincidence... There's something deeper going on... ........................... .................. ......... ???: ...ster Naruhodo... ...Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: (That voice... That's...Mr Sholmes!) What's going on? It's the middle of the night. Sholmes: It's Miss Lestrade... She's gone. Ryunosuke: Gina? Sholmes: She was supposed to be sleeping in Iris's room. But her bed is empty. Ryunosuke: Well...she's an independent young woman. She probably decided to go home, no? Sholmes: I think not. From speaking to her before she retired... ...I received the distinct impression that she was looking forward to breakfasting with Miss Susato. No, I don't believe the girl has gone home. But I've been waiting for over an hour now. Ryunosuke: Over an hour? Oh... Sholmes: If you'll indulge me, look out of the window, my dear fellow. Ryunosuke: (What's this about?) ...! Wait a minute... (Why is there a light on at this time of night?) Sholmes: That's Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery. Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank's... (Oh no!) Gina: It's simple! If that story was really in old Windibank's storeroom... ...there's no way someone from 'alf way around the world - in other words, you - could know about it. Gina: Sorry, Iris, but if you ask me, 'e's sold it. Wivout tellin' you. Ryunosuke: (Could Gina have gone...?) Sholmes: It seems you have some knowledge of the situation, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? ...Oh, no! No, not really. Sholmes: Well anyway, we must investigate. ???: At once! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! 16th April, 1:14 a.m. Baker Street Ryunosuke: The door to Windibank's... It's open! Susato: And the lamp is burning. Ryunosuke: It must be Gina...mustn't it? Sholmes: Let us hope it's nothing more sinister. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: Come, there's not a moment to lose! Clearly something is afoot inside! Ryunosuke: ...There's no one here... Sholmes: ...Oh yes... ...there is! *BANG!* Susato: AAAAAAAH!!! Mr Sholmes! Mr Shooolmes!!! Ryunosuke: What the- (Has Sholmes been shot?!) Sholmes: Leave me, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: But... Sholmes: After them! Go! Ryunosuke: Right! Ryunosuke: ...Blast! (I've lost them!) ???: 'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere? Bobby: The alarm was just raised from this pawnbroker's sir. Would you know somethin' about that? Ryunosuke: Officer! Come with me! It's my friend! Mr Sholmes! He's been shot! Bobby: Shot?! Ryunosuke: With the policeman close behind me, I ran back to Windibank's... Anime cutscene Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! Susato: Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: How bad is it? Sholmes: Agh...never mind me. But there's much at stake. Behind that door... In the storeroom! ...Hurry! Ryunosuke: Huh?! It's...it's Gina?! To be continued... *BANG!* AAAAAAAH!!! I'll be alright, Mr Naruhodo! After them! Go! Behind that door. In the storeroom! ...Hurry! It's...it's Gina?! From that moment, Windibank's Pawnbrokery became a crime scene. Everything that followed happened in a whirlwind of activity. The arrival of the police, the preliminary investigation of the scene and the questioning... It was just before dawn before I was allowed back to my lodgings at 221B. 16th April, 6:21 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Ryunosuke: Oh! Iris! Iris: A telegram came. But all it said was, 'Wait at home'. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, we asked one of the policemen to have it sent. It was simply impossible to come back. Iris: When I woke up...I was all alone. Hurley and Ginny were gone. Everyone was gone. What happened, Runo? Ryunosuke: (Poor Iris. She's trembling. She's obviously trying very hard not to let herself get too worried.) ...I'll explain everything that I know. Iris: Something awful has happened, hasn't it? Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, I'm afraid so. After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: I'm afraid I'll need to go out again now, Iris. There's not much I can do at the moment... But I can at least try to find out how Mr Sholmes and Gina are getting on. Iris: I want to go, too. Take me with you, Runo! Ryunosuke: ...! Iris: I can't stand just sitting around here waiting. Ryunosuke: (I'm not sure how I feel about taking a ten-year-old child to the scene of a murder... But I don't want to leave her all alone here, either.) Alright then, Iris. Perhaps you can help me? Iris: Oh yes! I'd love to! Ryunosuke: Gina's at the prison. Mr Sholmes is...probably in his hospital bed. Iris: And don't forget we have to visit the crime scene! We need to conduct a thorough investigation! Ryunosuke: Ah, I can see you're ready for action! (I imagine Iris would appreciate going to the hospital sooner rather than later...) Sholmes's Suite Baker Street 16th April St Synner's Hospital, Ward 3 Iris: Hurley! ...Oh! He's not here! Ryunosuke: No. That's strange... The nurse definitely said he was in the bed by the window, didn't she? Iris: Ooh, I know what's probably happened! Hurley was being a big baby. And the bullet wound wasn't that bad after all so he's been sent home. Ryunosuke: Hm, I'm not so sure about that. Baby or not... ...there's no question that it was a fairly serious injury that Mr Sholmes suffered. Iris: Oh... ???: 'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere? Bobby: This ward is off limits! No visitin'! So what are you doin' in 'ere, eh? Iris: Well, I'll have you know, we're Hurley's next of kin! Bobby: Eh? ...Oh! Well beggin' your pardon then, ma'am. Sir. ...A little lady and a curious Eastern gentleman... The great mystery-solver 'as a mysterious family, eh. Ryunosuke: (...If that's how you see us, um...sure.) Iris: Where is he, Constable? Where's Hurley? Bobby: I believe 'e is currently in the operatin' theatre, ma'am. Undergoin' an extensive operation. Iris: Extensive?! Bobby: It 'as been several 'ours since 'e went in. Iris: Oh dear... Is he going to be alright? Bobby: Well, it doesn't appear to be workin', you see. The anaesthetic, that is. Iris: Oh! Bobby: I 'ave 'eard a report that the gentleman claims 'e may 'ave 'ad a little too much to drink last night. Coffee, that is. Ryunosuke: Haah... Bobby: Anyway, I think it would be fair to assume that 'e won't be back 'ere for several 'ours yet. Ryunosuke: ...I see. Thank you, Constable. Perhaps we should leave and come back later. Iris: Oh, poor Hurley... 16th April Windibank's Pawnbrokery Iris: This is where it happened, then? Last night. Ryunosuke: That's right. The two thugs I told you about were obviously ransacking the place, looking for valuables. Iris: But... ...apart from the policemen in here, you wouldn't know anything had happened. There's no sign of a disturbance. Ryunosuke: No...you're right about that, actually. Iris: In fact, if anyone, it's the police who seem to be the ones doing the ransacking. Ryunosuke: I know what you mean. They're like a gang of organised criminals, all dressed in black! ???: Oi! I heard that! Ryunosuke: Oh, Inspector! Erm... Good morning. Gregson: Hmph. I s'pose I ought to thank you for your vigilance last night. We got to the scene before it was disturbed at least. Shame you let the two rogues get away, mind. Ryunosuke: Yes... I'm sorry about that. Iris: ...I thought you'd assigned extra men to the beat around here, Gregsy. Now look what's happened! Hurley's been injured because there weren't enough police on duty! Gregson: .........Ah! Y...Y...Your Ladyship! No one told me you were comin'! Iris: I expect you to take full responsibility for what happened to Hurley and see he has the very best medical care! Gregson: Of course, Your Ladyship! The very best doctors in the capital are tendin' to him as we speak! Iris: And I don't think it's Runo's fault that the rogues managed to get away, is it? Chasing criminals is the police's job. Gregson: Absolutely, Your Ladyship! As you say, ma'am, as you say! The gent in black is totally blameless! Everyone's in agreement about that. Ryunosuke: (Would you believe it?! He's like a completely different person with Iris. Talk about a personality change...) Gregson: Oh! Where are me manners? Are you thirsty, Your Ladyship? Perhaps you'd like some juice? Some nice, refreshin' fruit juice? Iris: Oh, why? Are you thirsty, Gregsy? I have some of my special herbal tea with me, if you'd like some! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Ta very much. That really hit the spot...Your Ladyship. Ryunosuke: (I don't even recognise him like this...) After clearing all Converse options: Gregson: Oh...yeah...there's somethin' I was s'posed to talk to you about, actually, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Yes? What is it? Gregson: I've got an important message for you. I clean forgot about it until now. Ryunosuke: An important message? (I wonder what it could be...) 16th April British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: (Yes... ...no matter how many times I come here, I always get the same sense of oppressiveness somehow...) Iris: Do you think the place is oppressive? I think it's normal. Ryunosuke: How so?! Iris: I mean, look at that suit of armour over there. You can't take that seriously, can you? Ryunosuke: ...Maybe it thinks the same about you. ???: ...So everything is clear with regard to tomorrow's arrangements, I trust? ???: Yes. Thank you very much. Ryunosuke: (There they are. Susato-san and Lord Stronghart.) Iris: I wonder what they're talking about. They both look very serious. Stronghart: Very good. There is nothing further to discuss. You may return to your lodgings. No doubt you have much to do in preparation for your return to your homeland. Ryunosuke: ......... (...Wait, what did he just say? 'Your return to your homeland'...?) Susato-san! Susato: ...! Oh! Um...Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: ......... What was all that about? Susato: ......... Stronghart: Ah, Mr Naruhodo. Thank you for coming to collect your colleague. Ryunosuke: What's this all about? Why were you talking about Miss Susato's 'return to her homeland'? And, and... ...tomorrow?! Susato: ......... Iris: Tomorrow...? But what about Ginny's trial? Susato: ...! You mean... ...she's been formally charged now? Oh dear... Iris: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Stronghart: ...Three minutes precisely until my next meeting. You must excuse me. Ryunosuke: ......... There's just...one more thing, Lord Stronghart. Stronghart: Which is? Ryunosuke: It's Miss Lestrade's trial... I wonder if you might permit me to defend her? Stronghart: ......... A timely suggestion. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Stronghart: The girl currently has no representation. Iris: But, but that's not fair! Yes, she may be a pickpocket, but she still deserves a fair trial! Stronghart: ...Do not misunderstand me, young lady. The government provides for those too poor to afford representation with a public defender. The accused need only sign the relevant paperwork, and a defence barrister will be assigned to the case. However...the young girl in question has refused that right. Ryunosuke: Why would she do that? Stronghart: A question you would do well to direct at Miss Lestrade. You'll find her at the local prison. Ryunosuke: Yes, thank you. Stronghart: Now then, it's time I was leaving. Good day to you. Ryunosuke: (What a day. Gina charged with murder... Susato-san about to leave...) Susato: ......... Come, Mr Naruhodo. Iris. We must make haste. Iris: But, Susie... ...you're leaving for Japan tomorrow morning, aren't you? Don't you have packing and things to do? Susato: ......... As Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant, my personal circumstances are of no consequence. My sole purpose remains to help you in whatever way I can. Ryunosuke: ...Thank you, Miss Susato. (That's a very pensive look...) Ryunosuke: (If I'm honest, this has completely thrown me off. I'll just have to do what I can...as a lawyer...) 16th April Local Prison, Cell 13 After clearing all Converse options at Local Prison, Cell 13 and Lord Chief Justice's Office: Susato: Gina... ...I wonder if you might hear me out. There's something I'd like to say. Gina: Wot? Susato: I'm sorry to say...that I must reluctantly bid you farewell. Gina: Eh? Farewell? Susato: Tomorrow, I must begin my journey back home. To Japan. ...I fear we may never meet again. Gina: ...! Oh...right... Susato: I've had the pleasure of meeting so many lovely people here in London. I have so many wonderful memories. And yet...as things stand now... ...it will be a glum parting indeed. Poor Iris is so miserable. Iris: Susie... Gina: Well...well...that ain't my business! Susato: Both Iris and Mr Naruhodo believe you to be innocent, Gina. They've put their faith in you. But somehow...you can't find it in your heart to put your faith in them. Gina: Yeah! That's right, I can't! ...Wot of it? Susato: It grieves me greatly to have to say goodbye to my friends when they are so clearly unhappy... ...because of you. Gina: ...! Wot, it's MY fault?! Susato: Yes. So I have one final request, Gina, before our paths never cross again. Right here and now... ...I want you to show both of them that you don't deserve the faith they've invested in you. Gina: Eh?! Susato: Only by doing that... ...will you truly be as alone as you claim to be. Gina: ...! Wot are you talkin' about? Wot d'you expect me to do, eh? Susato: You've told us that everyone lies. So prove it! ...By admitting one of your own untruths. Gina: ......... Iris: What about what you said before, Ginny? You said something about unforgivable lies. Susato: You must tell Mr Naruhodo and Iris the truth now. That is my last request before I leave. My last request as a judicial assistant. Gina: No... I, I can't... Ryunosuke: (Whatever these lies are, they're obviously weighing very heavily on Gina's mind...) Gina, I could be wrong, but... ...is it something to do with what happened two months ago? Something about that trial? The one in which Magnus McGilded was acquitted? Gina: Ah... Ryunosuke: The case of that mysterious murder that took place inside the omnibus... You were called as a witness by the prosecution. Is that what this is about? Gina: ......... Yeah. You're right. Because...in that trial... ...I lied. I lied like you wouldn't believe. Ryunosuke: ......... Will you tell us about it now? Gina: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Gina: ......... I bet yer ready to string me up, eh? I lied...in that big old courtroom. I told some corkers. Ryunosuke: ......... Gina: The thing is, 'e said 'e would make it so we couldn't live in the East End no more. That's wot 'e threatened me wiv. Iris: What a wicked man... Gina: 'E knew everyfin' wot went on in the back slums. 'E knew we 'ad no one to look after us, and we was all just lookin' out for each other, gettin' by together. Susato: So you mean...Mr McGilded would have- Gina: In an 'eartbeat! 'E could've 'ad the lot of us chased out o' there if 'e'd wanted. And then where could we 'ave gone, eh? Nowhere, that's where! So... I didn't 'ave no choice. ......... Ryunosuke: Thank you, Gina, for telling us everything. Gina: But...I'm for it now, eh?! Go on, admit it! You must be livid! Ryunosuke: Well...you can make amends by doing me a simple favour. Gina: ...A favour? Wot? Ryunosuke: Sign the representation papers for tomorrow's trial. Gina: Eh?! Ryunosuke: If you don't actually want me to represent you in court, you can rip it up later. But we need that paperwork or we can't investigate. The police won't let us. Gina: Investigate wot? Ryunosuke: The scene of the incident last night. Mr Sholmes was shot, you see. Gina: You wot?! Iris: Hurley's having a big operation right now, Ginny. Gina: Is it bad?! Is, is 'e gonna be alright? Sholmes is gonna be alright...right? Iris: ......... Ryunosuke: That's why I want to investigate. For Mr Sholmes's sake as much as anything. Gina: ......... Right. So wot yer sayin' is, if I sign that bit o' paper, everyone's 'appy, is that it? Ryunosuke: Something like that. ...Miss Susato? Susato: Yes! Of course! I have the representation papers here. Gina: ......... ...I, I don't need no one to stick up for me, though. No lawyer or nuffin'. Iris: Poor Ginny... She seems so lonely. Gina's representation papers have been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: Well...at least this should mean we can investigate the scene at Windibank's now. Iris: Yes. And perhaps we can come back to visit Ginny when we're done there? Ryunosuke: (I feel like we've finally cracked Gina. She's opened up to us at last. And now I have her representation papers... No one else knows just what a responsibility that is. Anyway, for now it means Inspector Gregson can't stop us investigating at Windibank's. Although something tells me he's not going to be happy about it...) To be continued... 16th April, 1:26 p.m. Windibank's Pawnbrokery Ryunosuke: (Here we are again at the scene of the crime... Now to thrust these representation papers in Gregson's face and see what he makes of them!) Hello again, Inspector. Do you have a minute, please? Gregson: What is it now? You should go home and get some rest. Iris: Here you are, Gregsy! Here are the representation papers! Gregson: .........Your Ladyship! Hooooooooooooooooooooow?! I don't believe it! How the devil did you get that stubborn little ragabash to sign that?! I salute you! That is good work, that is. Iris: I can see you've been very busy here as well. How about some tea? It's a special blend designed to relieve fatigue! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Well, let's see now... Yes... Yes! I hardly feel tired at all! I'm fit as a fiddle, Your Ladyship! Ryunosuke: ...Would it be alright if we investigated the scene of the crime, then? Gregson: Do as you please! You know where it happened. Through that door behind the counter. Ryunosuke: (Yes, the storeroom... That's where I discovered Mr Windibank...and Gina.) Gregson: Right, well...I'll be gettin' back to business then. Ryunosuke: Will you be investigating in the storeroom as well, Inspector? Gregson: If I'm perfectly honest, we need to wrap this up before long. Can't afford to spend too much time on it. But there are so many articles to go through, it's taking forever, even with the lads workin' round the clock. Which is a problem, 'cause there's another case the Yard needs to investigate urgently. Ryunosuke: (That must be what Lord Stronghart meant by 'far more serious matters' before...) Gregson: So what I'm sayin' is, don't get under my feet, sunshine! Susato: Come then! Let us not waste any time! After clearing all Converse options: Iris: So what do you think of these stereoscopic prints then, Runo? Ryunosuke: They're certainly amazing, but it isn't easy to get the knack of viewing them properly. Iris: No, some people find it easier than others. But that's why contraptions like this exist. For people who find it tricky. Susato: Oh! I recognise that. We saw one over there yesterday, didn't we? If I remember correctly, you press this little knob here... ...then set the pair of photographs in this stand at the back and... Ryunosuke: It's still amazing, even though I know roughly how it works now. Iris: Well, London seems to agree with you. Stereoscopes are very popular at the moment. You can find one of these folding contraptions in lots of households in the capital currently. Ryunosuke: But if these little machines are so affordable... ...surely there's no need to go around staring cross-eyed at pictures like you hate them. Iris: ......... But it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Well, I think so, in any case. Ryunosuke: (Stereoscopic pictures... I'd never even heard of them until yesterday. We've certainly learnt a lot about them. But I wonder if it's knowledge that I'll ever actually need...) The second white cat photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Iris: Oh! That looks like blood! Ryunosuke: I would say it's from a gloved finger. Almost certainly a glove made of leather. iris: Well don't worry, Runo! You can leave the rest to me! Ryunosuke: Look at that... Iris: Yes, that's a colour we haven't seen before, isn't it? Susato: We simply must add it to the portfolio of blood samples! It could be an important clue. Although...it would be nice to find out whose blood these different colours correspond to at some point. Ryunosuke: ......... (Well, this particular stain of blood...) Iris: Oh! You've had an idea, haven't you? Do you know whose blood this is? Ryunosuke: Yes, I have an idea whose blood it is. Not from the colour it turned, but with a little deduction. Iris: That's right! I think it's clear. Susato: Iris, you know as well? Iris: You first, Runo. Who do you think it belongs to? Ryunosuke: Alright, I believe that this is the blood of... Ryunosuke: ...'Thrice-Fired' Mason...? Iris: You don't sound very sure of yourself, the way you trailed off there. Ryunosuke: Well it was two months ago now, that case. And of course I'd never met the victim. So I'm struggling to remember his name. He was definitely 'Thrice-Fired', though. Susato: The victim...of the omnibus case? Yes, his name was indeed Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason. But that would mean that this bloodstain... ...was left on the ticket two months ago! Ryunosuke: Yes. I think it was. Gina brought this ticket here to Windibank's yesterday. I'm suggesting that the bloodstain was already on it at that time. Iris: So it's a smear of blood from the time that Mr Mason was killed two months ago! Susato: Something else is coming back to me now... Mr McGilded was also wearing leather gloves that night. McGilded: Now I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand. Ryunosuke: It certainly does look like a leather-gloved thumbprint, this mark. But we know that Mr McGilded had no injuries at the time, anywhere on his body. From which we can conclude... ...that any blood on the glove...belonged to the victim, Mr Mason! Susato: Mr Naruhodo! You sound just like Mr Sholmes! Ryunosuke: (...Minus the quirky slip-ups, I hope.) Iris: Yes, I think you're right, Runo! Susato: Very well. Let's make a note of this. The details of the pawnbroker's ticket for the coat have been updated in the Court Record. The blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record. 16th April Local Prison, Cell 13 Ryunosuke: Gina doesn't appear to be here. Susato: I believe she must be in questioning at the moment. Iris: Oh, but...wait a minute... Ryunosuke: What is it, Iris? Iris: Well if you examine the scene here carefully, there's another possibility, isn't there? Ginny could have slipped the key from the jailer when he wasn't looking and escaped! Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: Why, why would she do something like that? It would only make her situation worse! Iris: ......... Calm down, Runo! I was only joking of course! Ryunosuke: ......... Oh. Ugh...you had me worried there. I thought it was a 'great deduction'. Susato: Yes, it must be your way with words, Iris. You're so wonderfully persuasive. Perhaps you don't fully understand the weight your words carry. Iris: Oh dear... I'm sorry. I suppose a light-hearted great detective is a contradiction in terms. Ryunosuke: Well, in the same situation, I'm sure Mr Sholmes would just have thrown his head back and guffawed. Susato: I'm not entirely sure that's helpful, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Well anyway, it looks like we won't be able to talk to Gina for a while. We should try to make progress with our investigation in the meantime. Iris: Yes. Come along then, Runo! Come along, Susie! 16th April Windibank's Storeroom Iris: ......... Ryunosuke: (Poor Iris... She's clammed up completely.) Susato: Iris is bound to find this difficult. After all, Mr Windibank's life was taken in this very room only last night. Iris: ......... Gregson: .........Ah! Ryunosuke: Wait! Inspector! Gregson: What is it now, sunshine? Ryunosuke: You took one look at me and tried to run away! Gregson: You think a Scotland Yard inspector would run away from some jumped-up little defence lawyer, do ya? Iris: ......... Gregson: I just! Well... ...I've never seen Her Ladyship lookin' like that before, is the thing. I didn't know what to say to her. Ryunosuke: (So you weren't running away from me...you were running away from a ten-year-old.) Susato: I'm afraid this is all a little much for young Iris. Some gentle reassurance might go a long way perhaps, Inspector. Gregson: Eh?! Iris: ......... Gregson: Erm... Ahem! Don't, um... Don't trouble yourself unduly, Your Ladyship. I mean...at least you're not dead, are you? Ryunosuke: ...I don't think that went very well. Gregson: ......... WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! Look! I'm in the middle of an investigation here, sunshine! And I told you not to get under my feet! Susato: And we have investigating to do ourselves. Ryunosuke: Yes. I'd like to hear more of what the socially inept inspector has to say. Iris: Oh Hurley... Ryunosuke: (And enquire into how Mr Sholmes's operation is going...) After clearing all Converse options, examining calendar, and presenting Pawnbroker's Ticket (Coat) in Windibank's Main Shop, and clearing all Converse options, examining chalk outline, red chest, and revolver in Windibank's Storeroom: *Dong* *Dong* *Dong* Iris: AAAAAAGH!!! I nearly jumped out of my skin there! How could Mr Windibank set such a wicked trap?! Ryunosuke: I...I doubt he set out to scare anyone. Susato: Is that really the time? I think perhaps we should pay Gina another visit soon. Ryunosuke: Oh? Susato: Her trial is tomorrow. We must establish whether or not you will be defending her. I think we should ask her one more time. ...She may have changed her mind. Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: Don't you remember, Runo? You told her she could rip up the representation papers if she didn't want you to be her lawyer. Ryunosuke: ...Really? Did I say that? Yes. You did. Susato: The deadline for submitting the paperwork is fast approaching. Ryunosuke: (In that case, we had better hurry back to the prison and talk to Gina again.) 16th April, 5:41 p.m. Local Prison, Cell 13 Ryunosuke: Ah, Gina, good... You're back. Gina: Ah! ......... Susato: The police must have finished questioning her, then. Iris: Oh, how was it, Ginny? Was it awful? Gina: Eh? Oh... Didn't bother me. Ryunosuke: Thank you for the papers you signed before. It meant we were able to investigate at Windibank's. Gina: Oh...right... ......... Iris: Don't you want to know how we got on? We've been ever so busy. Gina: ......... Wot's the point in askin'? Won't change wot everyone's sayin'. That I did it. Iris: That's not... Gina: ......... Ryunosuke: Gina, we came to ask for your final decision. Gina: Eh? Wot decision? Ryunosuke: About tomorrow's trial. Will you let me defend you or not? Gina: ...! Susato: I must submit the paperwork now if you'd like Mr Naruhodo to represent you. Gina: Right...I see... Ryunosuke: (She's really lost her fight all of a sudden. But I know what that feels like. The worry is just so hard to bear...) Ryunosuke: Those stains on the sleeves of your new coat, Gina... They're blood, aren't they? Not that I know whose blood yet. Gina: WOT?! Susato: B-Blood, Mr Naruhodo?! Ryunosuke: You don't appear to have any obvious wounds yourself, though. So could it be blood that spattered from Mr Windibank when he was shot last night? Iris: Let's not beat around the bush here. This trusty friend of mine will get results much faster than anything else! Gina: Eh?! T-Take it easy, Iris! Iris: Don't move, Ginny! I'm going to shoot! Oh... Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: What the...? Forget the sleeves... Iris: ...The whole coat is covered in blood! Ryunosuke: (Of course! The black colour of the fabric was masking the stains. That's why we haven't seen them until now!) Susato: And the blood has reacted with the chemical to turn a purple colour... ...which matches one of the samples we've already collected perfectly! Iris: Yes, now let's see...who had the purple blood? Aha! Yes, it was the brickmaker, Mr Mason. The victim of the murder case two months ago. Ryunosuke: ......... (I knew it...) Gina: Wot, wot are you all on about? The victim? Wot d'you mean? Susato: ......... It's a rather uncomfortable situation, Mr Naruhodo, but I think this makes things quite clear. It means the omnibus case is finally solved. The truth about who really murdered the brickmaker, Mr Mason...is revealed. Gina: Oi! Would someone explain wot's goin' on?! Stop tellin' 'alf a story! Susato: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Susato: Gina...may I ask you something? Gina: Wot? Susato: I'd just like to make absolutely sure... What would you like us to do with these representation papers for tomorrow's trial? Gina: ......... 'Ow many times do I 'ave to say it? Rip 'em up and chuck 'em away. Susato: Are you really sure that's what you want? Gina: I bet that's wot 'e wants an' all now. Mr 'I'm-a-Believer' Lawyer over there. Ryunosuke: ......... Gina: Don't forget it was me in that trial two months ago. I led everyone up the garden path, didn't I? An' yer tellin' me you can believe in me after that? Not likely. Susato: ......... Well, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: (A lawyer's primary weapon is an unwavering belief in his clients... Ultimately it comes down to whether or not I feel I can trust Gina after everything that's happened...) Ryunosuke: Gina...let me say it again... Please allow me to represent you in tomorrow's trial. Gina: Eh? Are you 'alf-baked? Ryunosuke: Not at all. You've not once admitted to committing the crime, have you? What's more...I believe that you're telling me the truth. Gina: ......... Seriously, um...Mr Narrow-'Oddo... ...didn't you 'ear all of wot I said before? I'm a born liar. Fibs just trip off me tongue. And I'm a diver, don't forget. I pulled the wool over yer eyes two months ago and got you into all sorts o' trouble. Why would you ever trust me now? I just don't get it! Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Gina... Gina: ...! Susato: ...I do understand why you choose not to put your trust in others. But I assure you, there is more to this life than you yet realise. Gina: Wot d'you mean? Susato: The world we live in... ...is full of people you would do very well to trust. People who won't ever let you down. Gina: Eh? Ryunosuke: It's true that I'm just a student of law, and I'm certainly lacking in courtroom experience. But I can promise you this: Whatever happens...and until my very last breath... ...I am completely on your side! Gina: ......... Wot...wot d'you expect me to say to that? ......... Susato: Then it's decided. I will take these papers now and carry out the necessary preparations for tomorrow's trial. It would be a shame to throw them away now after it's been penned with your name so beautifully. Gina: ...Do wot you like. You Eastern lot are...are... I dunno wot you are! I don't get ya! Ryunosuke: (Gina's taken herself off to the back of her cell. She'd never admit it, but I hope she's feeling relieved. That turned out alright in the end...I think.) ........................... Susato: Whoever's hiding there... ...show yourself at once! Eavesdropping is the height of cowardice! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato?! Susato: Somebody is there in the shadows. I can sense it. Somebody who wasn't there before! Ryunosuke: What?! ???: ......... ...Blimey, you're sharp, eh? Gregson: I s'pose you were usin' one of those mystic Japanese arts. Like the art of stealth I've heard so much about. Ryunosuke: ...If anyone was being stealthy, it was you, Inspector. Iris: Gregsy! Gregson: Oh dear me, I am most terribly sorry, Your Ladyship! I didn't mean to startle you! Iris: How long have you been listening in on our conversation? Gregson: Good grief! Listenin' in?! No no no! I just got word that there were some visitors who were refusin' to leave even though it was after hours. I assure you, Your Ladyship, I only just arrived. This very minute! Not a moment earlier! That's all it is! Nothin' untoward! Nothin' at all! Ryunosuke: After hours...? Is it that late already? Gregson: So then, I'll humbly excuse myself now, Your Ladyship. Ta-ta! Toodle-oo! Cheerio! All the best! Bye, by and by! Ryunosuke: (That's a lot of farewells, and not one of them appropriate for 'Her Ladyship'.) Iris: Oh, but I wanted to have a chat! Gregson: I'm, I'm terribly sorry, but time is pressin' at the minute. Iris: Oh, I see. ...That's a shame. Gregson: If I don't get this emergency at the Supreme Court dealt with sharpish, Lord  Stronghart will, well... Iris: Emergency?! Ryunosuke: Lord Stronghart? Gregson: Nothin'! Forget I said anythin'! Anyway...ahem! I'm off! Iris: Alright, Gregsy, if you have to. But let's chat soon! Gregson: Delighted! Charmed! Can't wait! If you please! My pleasure! Ryunosuke: (That's a lot of pleasantries, and not one of them sounded sincere...) Iris: Gregsy's so funny! He says such silly things! Ryunosuke: It's certainly entertaining to see an inspector of the police fawning to a ten-year-old girl. (But anyway, I wonder what this emergency is at the Supreme Court...) Susato: I must attend the court clerk's office now before it closes. Ryunosuke: Yes, of course. Thank you, Miss Susato. Susato: ......... Kindly escort Iris home now, Mr Naruhodo. I shall meet you there later. Ryunosuke: And so our investigation came to an end. Susato-san went to file the necessary papers for my defence of Gina the following day. And then it hit me... I could no longer suppress the wretched feeling that had been gnawing away at my insides. Tomorrow...Susato-san would be leaving. Leaving Britain and making her way back to Japan. 16th April, 11:13 p.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Susato: Naruhodo-san... ...it's been a very trying day, hasn't it? I do hope you're not too exhausted. Ryunosuke: What about you, Susato-san? Today has been even more trying for you, I'm sure. (Mr Sholmes was shot before our eyes, Gina was arrested... ...all on the back of the news that her father has fallen ill and that she must return to Japan at once.) I...hope your father recovers soon. Susato: Thank you for your kind words. ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: I wonder why it is... ...that so many thoughts rage in my head like a storm... ...and yet I seem unable to find the words to express any of them. Ryunosuke: I know exactly what you mean. Susato: Anyway, I have one final task to complete as your judicial assistant. Once that is done, I shall make preparations for my departure tomorrow. Ryunosuke: (One final task...?) After clearing all Converse options: Susato: Well...it's getting rather late. I think you should go to bed now, Naruhodo-san. I must finish packing up my things in my room. Ryunosuke: Susato-san, I... Susato: I wish you the very best of luck tomorrow! ...Good night. Ryunosuke: Wait! There's, there's something I need to say! Susato: Haiiiiii-YA! Ryunosuke: What, what was that...? Susato: A secret technique of mine... The 'Susato Shutdown'. Ryunosuke: Shutdown? Susato: ......... Please...I implore you... If we have to voice our goodbyes... ...I won't be able to hold back my tears. Ryunosuke: ......... Susato-san... It truly had been a trying day. On our feet for hours... Getting Gina to open up to us... And learning the truth about that nemesis of a case. Physically and mentally, I was exhausted. And yet the idea of sleep seemed impossible. But I forced myself to close my eyes... ...eventually...my fatigue triumphed, and I fell into a deep sleep. ...................................................... 17th April, the Small Hours St Synner's Hospital, Ward 3 ???: ...Yes, I quite understand. ???: That is a great weight off my mind. Sholmes: Rest assured, I shall put everything in place, exactly as we have discussed. ???: Thank you so much. It has been an honour and a pleasure to be acquainted with you, Mr Sholmes. Sholmes: On the contrary. The pleasure has been mine. I bid you farewell...and Godspeed... ...my dear madam. To be continued...\nNash: We woz walkin' down Baker Street in the small hours, an' the gaff's door was ajar, see?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The front door of Windibank's was ajar, you say? What time of night was this? Nash: Must've been about one. ...Right, Ringo? Ringo: Yeah, I'd say so. ...Right, Sulky? Gregson: How would I know? The place would've been shut at one in the mornin'. Just like every other shop in town. Nash: Well it woz pitch-black inside, it's true. ...Ain't that right, Ringo? Ringo: I'm not so sure, Nash. I seem to remember a little light burnin' inside. Wot about you, Sulky, me old mucker? Gregson: ...Leave me alone. Ryunosuke: (There definitely was a small lamp burning inside. That's what alerted us to the situation in the first place.) Van Zieks: And when these gentlemen ventured into the open establishment... ...the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, already had the muzzle of her gun trained on the unfortunate victim. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That is pure conjecture! Judge: Hmmm... Van Zieks: Hah, perhaps. But it changes nothing. These brothers inadvertently wandered into the middle of a cold-blooded murder... ...simply because they found the door of the victim's establishment open and ventured inside. Nash: Right! That's wot 'appened!Ringo: It woz like some kinda sign. Beggin' for us to go in, it woz!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What are you trying to suggest? That you had to go in? Nash: Well, God moves in mysterious ways, they say, dun't they, Ringo? Ringo: They do, Nash, they do. Must've been some sort o' providence, I reckon. Ryunosuke: ...God's will often presents itself as the whim of thieves, does it? Nash: It weren't no whim. I'm dead sure o' that. Ringo: It weren't, Nash, it weren't. Like we said at the time... Nash: ...Ya don't just find doors open in the middle o' the night like that. Nah, there's no two ways about it... Ringo: ...It woz a sign that our long-lost bruvver was inside! Iris: They're not very good liars, are they? Ringo: Well...ya can't deny it. It led us to a bloke wot looks just like our bruv! Gregson: ...I said, cut it out. Ryunosuke: (Those chips are getting a chomping today...)Nash: But once we got inside, cor blimey lummy! We 'eard a gunshot from the back room!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A gunshot, you say. Just the one. Are you sure about that? Nash: Yup, just the one, guvnor. I can swear to that. Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. ...Ain't that right, Bruv? Gregson: ...The firearm used belonged to the victim himself. Iris: Yes, Mr Windibank always used to leave his gun lying around on the counter. Ryunosuke: Right. I remember. Gregson: When we examined it, we found the revolver was completely out of rounds. Iris: That makes sense. Mr Windibank always used to say he only ever kept a single bullet loaded. Ryunosuke: (That's true. I remember him saying that as well.) Judge: So we can say with considerable certainty... ...that only a single round was discharged from the firearm used as the murder weapon. Gregson: Yes, My Lord. We can. Van Zieks: And I should remind the court... ...that the firearm in question was discovered in the hand of the accused. Judge: Hmmm... Ryunosuke: (...Wonderful.)Ringo: We went to see wot woz wot, but the door was locked from the inside.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you mean the door between the main shop and the storeroom? Van Zieks: If my learned friend is having difficulty grasping the situation, perhaps a drawing would help. Excluding the shop's entrance from the street, there is only one other door. That of the storeroom. Nash: 'Course there woz only a little oil lamp burnin'. Not much to see by. Ringo: An' the door woz 'idden be'ind a curtain an' all. Ryunosuke: (That's right. When we arrived, the door was mostly obscured by the curtain.) Tell me... ...why exactly did you try to open that door? Ringo: Eh? Ryunosuke: Any normal petty thief would run at the sound of a gunshot, I should think. Nash: Oh, well, erm...your turn to rabbit, Ringo. Ringo: Well, Nash, erm...yeah... ...I s'pose...you'd 'ave to say we ain't 'normal', eh? Van Zieks: Broadly speaking, humans respond in one of two ways on hearing a gunshot or scream: The timid flee, gripped by fear, while the courageous investigate to see if they might help. These gentlemen are of the latter inclination. My learned Nipponese friend, it would seem, is of the former. Ryunosuke: (Alright... Somehow I just proved that I was a coward that night...) Judge: Thank you, Counsels... So, I believe we all understand that the door was locked and could not be opened. Proceed, witnesses...Nash: We never done nuffin', guvnor! We never took nuffin'! We just left after that, nice an' quiet.Press Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"You didn't do or take anything...\"Iris: What do you think about this pair, Runo?Ryunosuke: I think they're lying through their teeth, that's what I think. And I'm going to prove it!Iris: .........Ryunosuke: What is it, Iris?Iris: Weeell...I'm not really sure. There's just something a bit funny...about that prosecutor over there.Ryunosuke: Hm? (Wait, could this... ...could this testimony be some sort of a trap?)Ryunosuke: You didn't do or take anything... Is that your story?Nash: Well it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: So with no time to take your hands out of your pockets, you just left, nice and quietly, you say?Nash: That's right, guvnor. Nuffin' we 'ate more than violence. Peace-lovin' nibblers, we are, not bludgers.Ringo: We are, Nash, we are. Never even pulled me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: ...So, you'd clearly like us to believe...Nash: Eh? Come again...?Ryunosuke: As you fled from the pawnbroker's that night... ...did you not run into anyone else?Nash: Um...Ryunosuke: And...did you not fire a gun at that person?!Ringo: Erm...Judge: Saints alive! They fired a gun, you say?Nash: AAAAAAGH!!! Blimey, guvnor!Ringo: You ain't tellin' us it woz you in the doorway?!Ryunosuke: It was.Ringo: ......... Why the bleedin' Nora...Nash: ...Didn't ya mention that before?!Ryunosuke: You were armed with a gun. And as you fled the scene, you fired that gun... ...at London's greatest detective, Herlock Sholmes!They shot the great Mr Sholmes? I did hear that, actually. There was a rumour he'd been rushed to hospital....The great Sholmes? That's beyond the pale!Van Zieks: On the night in question... ...this pair were arrested by the police within minutes of the discovery of the crime scene. ...Their suspicious countenance rapidly gave them away.Ringo: Hehe...Van Zieks: And when searched... ...a firearm was indeed found in their possession.Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Van Zieks: Furthermore, the barrel shows signs of a shot having been fired from it.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Van Zieks: The prosecution invites His Lordship to examine the firearm recovered from these brothers.Judge: Yes, indeed... Remnants of powder around the muzzle, as you say, Counsel.Juror No. 5: ...!Juror No. 6: ...!Judge: The court will hold this weapon as evidence.The Skulkin brothers' gun has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: Now, my learned Nipponese friend...Examine evidence Skulkin Brothers' Gun Bullet cylinder Ryunosuke: So, there's ammunition still loaded in five of this revolver's six cylinders. Iris: Yes, which tell us that only a single shot has been fired from it. Ryunosuke: Exactly. Iris: The bullet that hit Hurley in fact, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes... It happened almost as soon as we'd walked in through Windibank's door. Iris: ......... I'll make those brothers pay.Ryunosuke: Y-Yes?Van Zieks: Here's to you successfully presenting the evidence.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: For yes, there are the telltale signs of spent powder on this gun, and a single bullet missing from the cylinder... ...but the prosecution demands evidence that it was fired at the scene of the crime under scrutiny in this trial!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Well, I don't need evidence! Because I was there!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ...However, the rest of us in this courtroom were not.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: If the defence fails to provide evidence in support of its rash claim... ...we shall have no choice but to toast your incompetence...and move on.Ryunosuke: (Evidence that these two fired that gun before they left Windibank's that night...)Judge: The court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof. What evidence shows that these witnesses unloaded a firearm in the pawnbroker's shop that night?Present Blood Samples Portfolio Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The evidence...is in this portfolio!\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The evidence...is this! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: My learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"The court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof.\"Ryunosuke: The evidence...is in this portfolio!Judge: What, what on earth have you there, Counsel?Ryunosuke: During the course of our investigations, we discovered a number of bloodstains.Van Zieks: ...Not trusting the police to do the job they're trained to do? How arrogantly Nipponese of you.Ryunosuke: W-Well anyway... ...we analysed all the blood samples we found and recorded the results in this portfolio.Judge: And you claim to have the evidence the court is demanding therein?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord.Judge: No more dallying then, Counsel. Present the pertinent evidence at once! What do you have in your portfolio that proves these witnesses unloaded a firearm at the scene?Present Windibank's Main Shop sample Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"What is that? Explain!\"Present any other sample Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: THIS is the blood sample that proves it! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"No more dallying then, Counsel.\"Judge: What is that? Explain!Ryunosuke: It's a photographic print taken at Windibank's pawnbrokery on the day of the incident.Judge: From the scene of the crime, is it? Is, is that... ...a bullet hole? And if my eyes do not deceive me, it appears the bullet is still lodged there.Ryunosuke: Yes, as Your Lordship noticed... ...the bullet pierced Mr Windibank's calendar. The date shown being the 16th of April - the very day of the pawnbroker's death.Judge: The incident occurred at one hour after midnight. But this indicates that a separate shot had been fired sometime after the calendar had been set to the 16th!Ryunosuke: That's right. And while it isn't irrefutable, the defence believes... ...this is credible evidence that the witnesses did fire a round from their gun in the pawnbroker's that night!Nash: NAAAAAAAAAH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! ...How does the prosecution stand, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: ......... If that is the direction my learned friend wishes to take, the prosecution has no objection.Ryunosuke: What?Van Zieks: But you'll forgive me for flinging my hallowed chalice aside in disgust at the repugnancy it exposes. Yes. On the night in question, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery illegally... ...and like the bold 'baddies' they claim to be, opened fire on the new arrivals before fleeing back onto the street!Nash: EEEEEEH?! Take it easy there, guvnor! Yer gonna land us in the soup!Ringo: We 'ad a deal! You weren't gonna get into them...details. Tell 'im, Sulky! Set the bloke straight!Gregson: ...I have nothin' to add.Ryunosuke: (So he knew, did he? Van Zieks knew their testimony would almost certainly expose the extent of their crimes.)Van Zieks: It would seem now... ...that I owe my learned Nipponese friend a word of gratitude.Ryunosuke: What do you mean?Van Zieks: What I mean...is that you have helpfully confirmed an important fact.Judge: To what fact do you refer, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: As has been established, at the point of their arrest, a single shot had been fired from the brothers' gun. However, if that shot found its target in Mr Sholmes... ...then clearly these witnesses cannot be accused of the fatal shooting of the proprietor and victim.Ryunosuke: Agh!Van Zieks: In other words...these two men... ...have no material connection to the murder of Mr Windibank at all!Ryunosuke: ...! (So that's it...)Nash: That's it! We didn't 'ave nuffin' to do wiv it!Ringo: We didn't, Nash, we didn't! That's wot I reckon!Van Zieks: Your crimes include unlawful entry, intent to steal, perjury and - let us not forget - attempted murder.Gregson: Quite a catalogue, eh, fellas?Nash: Ah...Ringo: We're in for it now, bruv...Van Zieks: Now then... ...let us take a moment to consider the aforementioned 'great detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes. It would seem the man patronised the pawnbroker's in question somewhat regularly.Ryunosuke: (Where's he going with this?)Van Zieks: Mr Sholmes appears to take pleasure in tinkering with eccentric machinery.Iris: 'Eccentric'? Says who?!Ryunosuke: ...Not me. Don't give me that look!Van Zieks: He installed a pair of machines like this one in the victim's shop.Iris: Oh! That's one of Hurley's 'Red-Handed Recorders'!Judge: What is that, Counsel? It has the appearance of a photographic contraption.Van Zieks: As Your Lordship has surmised, it is indeed a camera attached to a small timing device.Ryunosuke: Every half an hour, it automatically photographs the interior of the establishment. The idea being that if a thief were to break in to the shop, he would be caught red-handed.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: The prosecution has obtained the photographs taken by the device on the night in question. As the court will observe, copious identical prints are produced in a quite desultory fashion.Judge: Hmph, rather prodigal, I feel.Van Zieks: In fact there are two such devices in the victim's shop, My Lord. If I may refer the court to the plan of the premises, their respective positions are here...and here.Judge: You say these cameras produce a print every half hour. I'm afraid I fail to see... ...how that would help if the anticipated thief conducted his activities in one of the many thirty-minute intervals.Van Zieks: One can only pray that the would-be criminal lingers, My Lord.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: On the night in question, the witnesses currently in the stand were not caught on camera.Nash: Hehe, that's a bit o' Friar Tuck, eh, bruv?Ringo: Lady Luck luvs a Skulkin!Judge: Witnesses, at what time did your trespassing begin?Nash: Eh? ...Must've been just after one. ...Right, bruv?Ringo: Must've been, Nash, must've been. Yeah, just gone one.Van Zieks: In which case, minutes before these brothers entered the establishment... ...what scene might we expect to see within the shop? Let us examine the evidence...Judge: Good Lord! It's...it's the defendant! Miss Gina Lestrade!Van Zieks: As the court can clearly see... ...the accused is pictured, gun in hand, facing the victim over the shop counter. No doubt coercing the proprietor to open the door to his storeroom.Judge: Quite! One can only too easily imagine the events that unfolded. The court will take this photographic print as evidence, if you please, Counsel.The photograph of Gina has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke: Ugh...Iris: I, I don't believe it! Ginny...Van Zieks: In short... ...the accused is the only person who could possibly have killed Mr Windibank.Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!???:I say, My Lord...Juror No. 1: Wonder if I might put in a word at this point.Judge: Go ahead, Mr Foreman.Juror No. 1: Took a bally bullet to the knee in the Battle of Maiwand, 1880, don't you know. Decorated for it and all that, but forced to retire from service, sadly. 'Course, a medal can never outshine the exploits of chaps like us on the battlefield.Judge: Yes, Mr Foreman, and...? What exactly is your point?Juror No. 1: Carried on the battle after retirement, you see. The battle of daily life, if you like. And here I am now, leading this small squadron. Six men, all good and true. And we'll all go down together, you mark my words! One for all...and all for one!Van Zieks: ...The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have reached agreement, have they? Is that what we are to understand?Judge: Well, Mr Foreman? Is that correct?Juror No. 1: ......... In a manner of speaking...yes. That is the Garrideb Squadron's position, sir!Ryunosuke: What?! No! It's too soon to make a judgement here!Juror No. 1: Status report for the court, men! On the double!Juror No. 2: His Lordship insists on promptitude at all times. And that goes for making decisions, too.Juror No. 3: I think you'll find the truth is as clear as day now! I could reach out and touch it!Juror No. 4: I wouldn't have left it in there. I just wouldn't. But in all honesty, I can't actually remember...Juror No. 5: Situation clear. Stop. No room for doubt. Stop. Truth now undeniable. Stop.Juror No. 6: I am wery sorry for brothers. They are unlucky.Judge: Very well... ...I now call upon each member of the jury to state his or her leaning in this matter. Announce your considered verdicts to the court!Juror No. 1: Guilty!Juror No. 2: Guilty!Juror No. 3: Guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Guilty!Judge: It does indeed appear that the jury is unanimous in its leaning already.Ryunosuke: (That photograph... It must be the definitive evidence that Gregson mentioned!)Iris: But Ginny didn't shoot him!Ryunosuke: No, of course not! My Lord! The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination!Judge: Very well. The court grants permission.Van Zieks: So...you refuse to admit defeat again. How...unsurprising.Judge: We shall proceed immediately with the summation examination. Mr Foreman, are all members of the jury ready?Juror No. 1: Abso-bally-lutely, sir! Always ready for action, my chaps!Judge: ...Very good. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have determined the defendant to be guilty!Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1: All the evidence clearly points the finger of guilt at this young pickpocketienne.Juror No. 2: As a housemaid, I should like to see all filthy eyesores promptly and rigorously eliminated.Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you look at that photograph in stereo, the truth will just pop out.Juror No. 4: If I have left it in there, I should think there'll be repercussions by now...Juror No. 5: Mind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.Juror No. 6: In motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.Judge: Hmmm... The circumstance of the crime and the evidence do indeed implicate the defendant rather comprehensively.Van Zieks: The storeroom, locked from the inside, in which the victim and the accused were discovered alone. And in the accused's hand, the fatal revolver, the firing of which was heard by these witnesses.Juror No. 1: Not to mention this print! Take it from a chap whose [sic] seen action on the battlefield: That young girl's on the verge of pulling the bally trigger!Ryunosuke: (...Thanks a lot, Mr Sholmes.)Iris: Oh dear... Hurley's cameras were supposed to help, not hinder.Judge: I'm afraid I think you have an uphill struggle ahead of you.Ryunosuke: (But Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank. Which means there's more to this situation that we've yet to see.)Iris: Agreed!Judge: You have the floor, Counsel. Proceed with the summation examination!Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1: All the evidence clearly points the finger of guilt at this young pickpocketienne.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You're Mr Natsume's landlord, Mr Garrideb...aren't you? We really must stop meeting like this. Juror No. 1: ......... Ah, you're that lawyer chap. Well, there's a turn-up for the books! Yes, rather a turbulent time we had back then. Ryunosuke: Some extraordinary events took place at your house, that's for sure. Luckily Mr Sholmes and I were able to get to the bottom of it all. Juror No. 1: ...! Ryunosuke: I think we did rather a lot for you, didn't we? Juror No. 1: ......... Ryunosuke: I mean, obviously... ...I wouldn't be suggesting that therefore you should change your leaning to not guilty or anything! Juror No. 1: ......... Hmph. Can't be denied, I suppose. The 'curse of the Garrideb house' was the talk of the town after that business. Lodgers moved out, and I couldn't get a bally soul to take up the tenancies. Ryunosuke: Oh. Juror No. 1: Haven't had the heart to break the news to Joanie yet. Bad enough that the old girl's clapped up. Yes, can't be denied...you did do rather a lot. But not for us, that's for dashed certain. Ryunosuke: I suppose not... Juror No. 1: 'Course... ...there can be no suggestion of that being the reason I'm leaning towards guilty here, obviously. Ryunosuke: (...Obviously. But honestly... ...I really wish he'd pay more attention to the trial, and less to juror number two.)Juror No. 2: As a housemaid, I should like to see all filthy eyesores promptly and rigorously eliminated.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...Polishing the bench, I see...again. Juror No. 2: A maid's work is never done. Not a blemish must remain. Ryunosuke: Um, what exactly do you mean by 'filthy eyesores'? Juror No. 2: On my way to market for His Lordship, I have to pass through the East End. The place is full of beggars, pickpurses and crossmen. The scum of the earth! Ryunosuke: ...A little harsh, perhaps. Juror No. 2: Let me be plain... If it were up to me, all those back slums would be made spick and span or eradicated. At least we have people like the great detective working to achieve these important goals. Ryunosuke: You're referring to Mr Herlock Sholmes? Juror No. 2: That's right. I like to keep abreast of his exploits by reading Randst Magazine in between my duties. He does wonders, cleaning up London's streets. In my opinion, he should be declared an honorary maid of the capital. Ryunosuke: ...Mr Sholmes? ...A maid? Juror No. 2: It's really quite unforgivable... Gutter scum having the audacity to shoot our very greatest detective! Ryunosuke: ......... Minor detail: It was the two brothers in the stand who shot Mr Sholmes, not the defendant. Juror No. 2: A minor detail indeed. They're all gutter scum as far as I'm concerned! Ryunosuke: Weeell...it just might be an idea to get our facts straight anyway... Juror No. 2: ...Yes, alright. I shall amend my statement. Changes Juror No. 2's statement to \"Those brothers are the scum of the earth! They should swing for shooting the great detective!\"Juror No. 2: Those brothers are the scum of the earth! They should swing for shooting the great detective!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I agree with you. The shooting of Mr Sholmes was an unforgivable act. But the purpose of this trial is to determine who shot the pawnbroker, Mr Windibank. Juror No. 2: ...I'm afraid you're splitting hairs, sir. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Juror No. 2: Whether it was the thieves or the pickpurse... ...it was still gutter trash that shot the pawnbroker in the end. Filth that should be cleaned up and eradicated...in my considered opinion. Ryunosuke: (Thanks so much for sharing. ...Changing this maid's mind isn't going to be easy.) Iris: Runo... ...it was one of those two brothers that shot Hurley, wasn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes. Without question. Iris: Well then I'll never forgive them! Ryunosuke: Oh, Iris... Iris: Perhaps we can use this maid's statement to help us somehow, do you think? Ryunosuke: Yes, maybe. Let's listen carefully to what each juror has to say first...Pit against Juror No. 6's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself! Juror No.2: Oh my! My statement? Contradictory? Juror No. 6: Contradict... C-o-n... Ryunosuke: Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick. Juror No. 6: ...I do not have stick. I have mouse. Ryunosuke: As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver. Juror No. 2: Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand! Ryunosuke: ...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d... Ryunosuke: ...Sir? Juror No. 6: Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning. Ryunosuke: ...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Forgive me. I did not hear. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 6: ...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker. Ryunosuke: (...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!) Juror No. 6: So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative. Ryunosuke: Yes! That's exactly right! Juror No. 6: Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal! Ryunosuke: ...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced. Juror No. 6: This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?! Ryunosuke: Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so... Juror No. 6: Enough! I trust no one now! Ryunosuke: ...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir. Juror No. 6: I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself! Ryunosuke: I'm afraid that won't be poss- Iris: Yes it is, Runo! Easily! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder! Ryunosuke: Ah... Iris: If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor! Van Zieks: Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight. Iris: So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken. Ryunosuke: (That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.) Juror No. 6: So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing. Ryunosuke: It would seem so, yes. Juror No. 6: Good. Ryunosuke: No, not good. Juror No. 6: You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial. Iris: Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting! Ryunosuke: Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still! Judge: Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence. The post-shooting photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: (Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...) Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.\"Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you look at that photograph in stereo, the truth will just pop out.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you mean, 'look at the photograph in stereo'? Juror No. 3: Sorry? What? Don't, don't you know? If you look at the photographic print normally... ...it looks as though the pickpocket girl is about to shoot the victim, obviously. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But there's no indication that the defendant ever fired the gun! Juror No. 3: All I'm saying is that if you look at the same print in stereo, it could reveal all sorts of new information. Ryunosuke: ......... By any chance... ...are you a fan of stereoscopes? Juror No. 3: Ooooooh! How did you know?! Ryunosuke: ...Let's call it a lucky guess. Juror No. 3: It never gets old, seeing the two prints merge into one before your eyes! It's extraordinary! It's captivating! It's the height of modernity! Ryunosuke: ...Of course. Juror No. 3: Oh yes! I think you'll find that the stereoscope is here to stay! Giving us new perspectives we could only dream of before, it's the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Ryunosuke: (...If only it could give me a new perspective on this case, I might agree with you.)Juror No. 3: All we'd need is another shot from a slightly different location, and we could see the scene in three dimensions!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Can it really show up new clues, though? Juror No. 3: Don't know unless you try! Ryunosuke: How about this print here? It should do the trick, I think. Present Photograph of Gina or Post-Shooting Photograph Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Alright then, juror number three... ...are you saying you can do this with any two suitable photographic prints? Juror No. 3: Of course I can! Ryunosuke: Very well then...I'd like you to demonstrate. Juror No. 3: I'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all! Present Post-Shooting Photograph or Photograph of Gina (whichever has not been presented yet) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Wait, sorry? What do you mean, one more print? Juror No. 3: Oh dear, oh dear... Don't you have these in the Far East? Don't you know how a stereoscope works? Iris: Runo! Ryunosuke: What? Iris: You need two photographs for a stereoscope, remember? You know, one for the left eye, and one for the right. Ryunosuke: Oh, oh yes. I remember now. But the print we have from the pawnbrokery is just a normal photograph. Juror No. 3: No no no. I think you'll find... ...that the clue is in the name. It's a stereoscope, not a monoscope! You always need two prints! Ryunosuke: (...Thanks for the friendly explanation.) Iris: Hmmm... Well, if we obtain another print at some point later in the trial... ...we can always show it to this young man then. Juror No. 3: Hahaha! Ryunosuke: (I think you'll find...that know-it-all expression is really starting to annoy me.) Judge: Let's get things back on track, shall we, Counsel? Leads back to summation examination Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Ugh...I was wrong. I can't actually think of anything we could use at all. Iris: What? Really? Oh dear, I think maybe I need to have a stereoscopic look at your brain sometime. Ryunosuke: (...What's that supposed to mean?) Leads back to summation examinationJuror No. 4: If I have left it in there, I should think there'll be repercussions by now...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um, what exactly have you been muttering about all this time, sir? You keep talking about having left something somewhere or something like that. Juror No. 4: Ah...so sorry. As you can probably tell, I'm a surgeon. Ryunosuke: A surgeon?! (That totally passed me by...) Juror No. 4: Of course, people conducting surgery in this country aren't considered to be doctors. Oh no! Even though me and my kind are at the forefront of medical science! The real brains in the field! Ryunosuke: So...what is it that you think you've left behind? Juror No. 4: Ah well, that's...a little embarrassing, to be honest. You see I was operating on someone yesterday. Standard thing - went in through the abdomen. But when I'd finished the procedure, I... Well, I couldn't find my scalpel anywhere. Ryunosuke: What?! (Did he...? Surely not!) Juror No. 4: Exactly! 'Surely not!' you say to yourself, don't you? Worrying, isn't it? That's what's been troubling me this whole time. Could I really have left my scalpel inside the fellow's belly? ...No, of course I couldn't! So...there you have it. Like I said, a little embarrassing, really. Ryunosuke: ...That's one way of putting it. The other is manslaughter. Juror No. 4: That's exactly my concern! And seeing as this case appears to be all but sewn up... ...I need to focus on trying to remember exactly what I've sewn up elsewhere! Now...I'm sure I made sure everything was back as it should be. Well, as sure as you can be without being sure. Ryunosuke: (...I'm sure you need to be more sure.)Juror No. 5: Mind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Sorry, 'radio transmission'? What do you mean? Juror No. 5: ...Are you from the Far East? Stop. Ryunosuke: Um, yes. From the Empire of Japan. Juror No. 5: All communication with Far Eastern nations used to take place by mail. Royal Mail steamers take more than a month to complete the journey. Iris: Ah, but now we have the electric telegram. So we can send messages using electrical signals. Thousands of miles of cables have been laid along the ocean beds, connecting the entire world. Ryunosuke: Thousands of miles of cable? ...On the ocean bed? (It makes my head hurt just thinking about it.) Juror No. 5: You are well informed, young lady. Iris: Hehe! Juror No. 5: But cables will soon become a thing of the past. Stop. Ryunosuke: ...And just when I was starting to catch up. Juror No. 5: Radio transmission is the future. Stop. Messages carried over airwaves to four corners of globe. Stop. Excitement growing! Stop. Atmosphere electric! Stop. Ryunosuke: Right... (...Try not to wear out your fingers.) Juror No. 5: Era of wireless telegraphy! Stop. Driving technological revolution! Stop. And people say inventions like the stereoscope are the height of technology! What utter piffle! I can't understand it. I really can't. They're just silly toys! Pursue Juror No. 3 Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Erm, juror number three...sorry to interrupt when you're obviously fuming, but... Juror No. 3: What?! Ryunosuke: Do you perhaps have something to say about juror number five's last remark? ...As if I couldn't guess. Juror No. 3: Oh, you bet I do! Say that again! Go on! I dare you! Juror No. 5: Goodness! Are you talking to me? Ryunosuke: ...I think he just might be, yes. Juror No. 3: You think stereoscopes are just toys, do you? Huh? Juror No. 5: Absolutely. I mean, really! A machine to view photographs in three dimensions? Why on earth would you not just use your eyes to look at the world around you? It's all three-dimensional! Ryunosuke: ...What a great way to appease the man. Juror No. 5: No, I'm sorry. Stereoscopes are of no practical use at all. Juror No. 3: ......... You just don't know! Juror No. 5: Pardon? Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that viewing a photograph through a stereoscope... ...can unlock all sorts of possibilities! I'm obviously going to have to demonstrate! Ryunosuke: What sort of possibilities? Juror No. 3: Well, take a crime scene, for example. If you had a pair of photographs from a crime scene that you could view through a stereoscope... ...it could reveal hidden clues you'd never even noticed before! Ryunosuke: What?! Iris: Have you got any, Runo? Any prints we could look at with a stereoscope? Absolutely! Ryunosuke: How about this print here? It should do the trick, I think. Present Photograph of Gina or Post-Shooting Photograph Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Alright then, juror number three... ...are you saying you can do this with any two suitable photographic prints? Juror No. 3: Of course I can! Ryunosuke: Very well then...I'd like you to demonstrate. Juror No. 3: I'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all!

I can't actually think of anything we could use at all. Iris: What? Really? Oh dear, I think maybe I need to have a stereoscopic look at your brain sometime. Ryunosuke: (...What's that supposed to mean?) Leads back to summation examination None spring to mind Ryunosuke: Ugh...no, I don't think so. None spring to mind, anyway. Iris: Well if you find any, we should definitely try it! Ryunosuke: ...I don't think we're just going to find prints of the crime scene lying around, you know. (But I suppose if we somehow find ourselves with some, it would be worth a go...) Leads back to summation examination Ryunosuke: ...Don't spare any feelings, will you? It's not like there's anyone here who likes stereoscopes... So...why exactly do you think that the defendant is guilty? Juror No. 5: It's quite simple... We haven't been shown a scrap of evidence to suggest that she isn't the culprit. And just as radio waves dash through the skies faster than the eye can see... ...so we should dash to the conclusion of this trial, and stop pandering to in-dit-cision!Juror No. 6: In motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Please tell me you're not Vilen Borshevik... ...the Russian revolutionary. Juror No. 5: Re-Revolutionary?! Juror No. 6: ......... Da. I believe there is such a rumour. Ryunosuke: ...It's just a rumour? Juror No. 6: As you see, I have unfortunate appearance. I look like wicious criminal. Ryunosuke: (...Your words, not mine. Just want to point that out.) Juror No. 6: People call me revolutionary...murderer...autocrat... Juror No. 5: And...which glove fits? Juror No. 6: 'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.' Juror No. 5: ......... Ryunosuke: (Right. That didn't sound staged at all. You'll forgive me for having my doubts.) Juror No. 6: To be treated like wicious criminal all the time... It is wery painful. People do not realise. So I have much sympathies for these brothers. People say they are criminals only because of how they look. Ryunosuke: The Skulkin brothers? Juror No. 6: Da, maybe they went inside pawnbroker's shop. But they have done nothing wrong. That is all what I want to say! Ryunosuke: ...The Skulkin brothers did nothing wrong that night? (Alright, well first of all... ...that's one not-so-little misunderstanding I'll need to clear up straight away.) Tell me something, Iris... Iris: Hm? What is it, Runo? Ryunosuke: The jurors are chosen at random from the inhabitants of London town, aren't they? Iris: Yes! It's amazing, isn't it? Ryunosuke: In that case... ...how is it that there's a Russian tourist sitting among them, who looks for all the world like a revolutionary? Iris: ...I wish I knew.Pit against Juror No. 2's statement (after Juror No. 2 changes her statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself! Juror No.2: Oh my! My statement? Contradictory? Juror No. 6: Contradict... C-o-n... Ryunosuke: Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick. Juror No. 6: ...I do not have stick. I have mouse. Ryunosuke: As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver. Juror No. 2: Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand! Ryunosuke: ...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d... Ryunosuke: ...Sir? Juror No. 6: Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning. Ryunosuke: ...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Forgive me. I did not hear. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 6: ...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker. Ryunosuke: (...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!) Juror No. 6: So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative. Ryunosuke: Yes! That's exactly right! Juror No. 6: Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal! Ryunosuke: ...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced. Juror No. 6: This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?! Ryunosuke: Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so... Juror No. 6: Enough! I trust no one now! Ryunosuke: ...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir. Juror No. 6: I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself! Ryunosuke: I'm afraid that won't be poss- Iris: Yes it is, Runo! Easily! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder! Ryunosuke: Ah... Iris: If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor! Van Zieks: Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight. Iris: So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken. Ryunosuke: (That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.) Juror No. 6: So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing. Ryunosuke: It would seem so, yes. Juror No. 6: Good. Ryunosuke: No, not good. Juror No. 6: You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial. Iris: Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting! Ryunosuke: Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still! Judge: Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence. The post-shooting photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: (Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...) Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.\"Juror No. 6: In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.Ryunosuke: (If I can't change the minds of more than half of these six jurors... ...the trial will be over.)Iris: But we know that Ginny would never shoot anyone.Ryunosuke: Yes, so we need to find contradictions in what these jurors are saying and pit them against each other. (I must be ready to go to whatever lengths I have to... to convince them of Gina's innocence!)Ryunosuke: Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.Juror No. 3: Yes, I see. Tell me, Mr, um...lawyer. Do you know how stereographic images work? Do you understand the principle?Ryunosuke: Well...I think so... (I did have a lesson only yesterday...) The left and right eye images need to be the same, only with a slight shift in the positions of some objects. Then when your brain merges the two images together inside your head, it notices the shift as if it were depth.Juror No. 3: Yes, exactly.Iris: It's that small shift between certain objects in the two pictures that's really important.Ryunosuke: So what happens if you use two photographs that are exactly the same, then?Juror No. 3: No no, obviously that wouldn't work at all. Not for seeing the scene three-dimensionally, anyway.Iris: Oh... OOOOOOH! Of course! Now I see!Juror No. 3: Ah! I think the young girl has discovered the secret!Iris: I have, I have!Ryunosuke: ...Can you uncross your eyes before you tell me?Iris: Have another look at these two pictures from Hurley's camera, Runo! Go on! Can you see that there's a really obvious difference between them?Ryunosuke: Of course there is! There are two people in the first, and no people in the second!Iris: Well yes, you can see that straight away. But now... ...try looking at the pictures in three dimensions!Ryunosuke: Alright, I'll, I'll give it a go. (So, to start with... ...you have to cross your eyes, and then try to make the two pictures overlap exactly.) ........................... (Let's see if by crossing my eyes I can make the quill pens from each picture overlap in the middle...) ........................... (...Wait...)Iris: Well? Did you manage to see it properly, Runo?Not really... Ryunosuke: I'm just not very good at this, that's the trouble. Iris: Oh, don't worry. I have just the thing! I happened to bring with me...a portable stereoscope! Ryunosuke: ......... I know I mentioned this yesterday, but if you've had that contraption with you from the outset... ...you could have saved me staring at Mr Windibank and Gina like I hate them all that time! Iris: And if you remember, I said in reply... ...that it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Anyway, why don't we try using this helpful little aid now? Here goes... Ryunosuke: ........................... (Now, let's see what we've got... ...Wait! Look at that!)  Leads to: \"Agh!\"Yes, I saw it! Leads to: \"Agh!\"Ryunosuke: Agh! What's, what's going on with these two pictures? Some of the things on the counter sort of... They sort of jump out at you!Juror No. 3: Yes yes yes! That's it, you see! That's the other amazing power of stereoscopes!Ryunosuke: O-Other amazing power?!Juror No. 1: Is someone going to explain this...black magic, eh? Why the deuce do some of the things on the counter seem to jump out at you like that, hm?Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you consider the basic principle of the stereoscope, you'll answer your own question.Juror No. 5: Basic principles...of the stereoscope...?Juror No. 3: As I said before... ...if you try to look at two identical pictures using a stereoscope, it won't work at all. It's the slight shift in the positions of certain objects that lets you see pictures three-dimensionally.Ryunosuke: ...In other words... ...even though at first glance it seems the objects on the counter haven't moved at all between the two pictures... ...this shows that actually...there must have been a slight shift in their positions!Iris: Yes, there must have been.Juror No. 1: Now hold fire there, sir! Got a reasonable grasp of this whole cross-eyed business now, I'd say. But why the devil does this shift between the two prints exist in the first place? Well? What's the answer, fellow? Come on, you're the cross-eyed master!Ryunosuke: What? Me? (I haven't the first idea!)Iris: You know, Runo! It's quite simple.Ryunosuke: It, it is?Iris: Just think it through step by step. The first photograph was taken at 1:00 a.m. Then, thirty minutes later...the second photograph was taken. But the position of some items on the counter appears to have shifted slightly in the interim. So that means...?Ryunosuke: That means that sometime in the half hour interval... ...someone must have tampered with the things on the counter!Juror No. 1: Zookers!Juror No. 3: Someone tampered...?Juror No. 5: New information! Stop. Not mentioned in testimony so far! Stop.Ryunosuke: (Yes... ...we've had to go around in circles a little here, it seems... ...but I'm starting to see what I should be aiming at in this summation examination now.) Ladies and gentlemen! The question now is clear. We know the items on the countertop were moved. ...But by whom?Juror No. 1: Are you... Are you suggesting you might know?Ryunosuke: Of course. I can tell you right now who is responsible for the almost imperceptible shift in the items on the counter!Present Nash Skulkin or Ringo Skulkin profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Quite clearly it was the work...of this meddler! Judge: Hm... I'm afraid you've digressed there, Counsel. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: It should now be clear even to you... ...who is responsible for the impeachable shift in the direction of this trial...toward the absurd. Ryunosuke: Let me guess... ...Me? Van Zieks: Shift aside, my Nipponese friend, and let the real lawyers do the talking! Ryunosuke: Uargh! (I really felt that one...) Iris: If you think about it... ...it has to have been someone who was in Windibank's when everything was going on, doesn't it? Ryunosuke: Well...yes, that's true. Iris: So... ...that narrows it down quite a lot, I think. Ryunosuke: I'll have another think! (We know somebody must have touched the things on Mr Windibank's counter. So who was it?) Leads back to: \"Ladies and gentlemen!\"Ryunosuke: It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!Juror No. 2: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Juror No. 6: Wait! This does not agree with what brothers said in testimony before. They said they did not even have time to pull 'dukes' from 'Lucy Lockets'. My phrasebook says 'dukes' is meaning 'hands' and 'Lucy Lockets' is meaning 'pockets'. But is this...another lie?! Is this what you are saying?!Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm afraid so.Juror No. 4: Now hold on there a minute! You can't be sure of that.Juror No. 2: I quite agree. The accused is a common pickpurse, after all. It's perfectly possible that she went through the things on the desk to see what she might steal.Ryunosuke: I think...that's unlikely.Juror No. 1: And why, exactly?Ryunosuke: ...As you can see from...this photographic print, the defendant was pointing a gun at the victim. It would seem, as my learned friend indicated, that she was coercing Mr Windibank to open the storeroom door. In other words, Miss Lestrade's interests lay within the storeroom, not in the main shop... ...giving her no reason to touch anything on the counter. All of which points to one thing! The Skulkin brothers have omitted key facts in their testimony!Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...! But the accused is a pickpurse! Common gutter trash! Why look any further for the wrongdoer here?Ryunosuke: Because the Skulkin brothers are thieves, madam. No better - in fact worse - than a pickpurse.Juror No. 2: ...!Ryunosuke: I believe that these brothers were looking for something on the victim's counter that night.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Ryunosuke: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you would condemn the defendant on the grounds that she's a pickpocket... ...would it not at least be right and proper to thoroughly scrutinise testimony given against her by two thieves?Juror No. 4: ...Well said.Ryunosuke: ...!Juror No. 4: I for one would like to hear more from that shady pair!Juror No. 3: Can you all see now? I think you'll find stereoscopes aren't playthings! You've seen their extraordinary potential firsthand!Juror No. 5: Wholeheartedly agree! Stop. Must purchase after trial. Stop. Will return home via Regent Street. Stop.Judge: Well...it would seem this trial has yet to run its course. The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have declared their inclinations via the mighty Scales of Justice. I hereby call this summation examination to conclusion with the balance altered in the defendant's favour. Two lean to guilty. Four lean to not guilty. Accordingly, the jury is without consensus... ...and I order this trial to continue.Iris: Yay! Well done! ...Oh, by the way...Ryunosuke: What?Iris: You should hold onto this, Runo. You never know when it might come in useful!Ryunosuke: (Twice in one trial would be unusual, surely? But alright.)The stereoscope has been entered into the Court Record.Judge: Lord van Zieks... ...you will instruct the witnesses that the court demands additional testimony from them.Examine evidence Stereoscope Print tray Iris: You have to pop your two prints in here to start with, you see. Ryunosuke: And then, when you look through the eyepieces, you can see the image in three dimensions! Iris: The important thing to get right is the position of the two prints. Ryunosuke: (I don't know who came up with the idea of a stereoscope, but it's really quite fascinating.) Button Ryunosuke: Ooh! Look at that! It's totally changed shape, just from one little button press! Iris: Well, that is what the button's for, Runo. You're just like Hurley. You boys love pressing buttons, don't you, especially if you don't know what they do! Ryunosuke: (Us boys? ...Says the ten-year-old girl.) Iris: Anyway, now you can see that it really is a stereoscope, can't you?Van Zieks: ......... I'm sure it won't spoil the bouquet to do so...My Lord.Ryunosuke: (I've won myself another chance to probe that pair about their activities that night at least. And I won't stop probing them until I've proven that Gina is innocent!)To be continued...Judge: Order, please. Let us resume proceedings. Witnesses! You will now retake the stand.Judge: I presume you heard the defence counsel's summation examination?Nash: Oh...yeah...guvnor.Ringo: I did, guv, I did.Ryunosuke: ...Mr and Mr Skulkin!Cor!Blimey!Ryunosuke: (...This is going to be hard work.) Earlier in this trial, you gave the following testimony about your actions after you entered Windibank's...Nash: Well it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: However...that was a lie! You brothers!Cor!Blimey!Ryunosuke: On the night in question... ...you rifled through the items on the victim's counter!We never done nuffin' o' the sort!'Ow d'you figure that out?.........Judge: You will now give formal testimony once again. You will tell the court precisely what happened on the night in question. And this time...you will tell the truth.Van Zieks: ...Each lie that passes your lips serves to increase the severity of your punishment. And that, gentlemen, may deal a crushing blow to your chances of ever seeing the light of day again....!...!Van Zieks: A thought worth pondering perhaps.Say no more, guv! We 'ear ya!We'll blab! We'll speak! We'll peach!Witness Testimony - Illegal Entry: The Whole Truth -Nash: Alright, we did knock a few things over. But we weren't riflin' fer nuffin'!Ringo: It woz when we 'eard the gunshot, see. Made us both jump, an' all that stuff went flyin'.Nash: Lummy, it didn't 'alf gimme a fright! We woz thinkin' the shooter'd come out the door and get us next.Ringo: We stuck everyfin' back where we found it and scarpered...straight into 'im in the black.Nash: We couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?Judge: Hmmm...so you admit to the defence's accusation. You did indeed ransack Mr Windibank's countertop on the night in question.Nash: Err...not ransack, guvnor, no.Ringo: That's right, Nash, that's right. It's...more like we tidied up. Yeah.Van Zieks: .........Ringo: Ugh...sorry.Van Zieks: By their own admission, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery under dubious circumstances. However, they panicked and fled on hearing the gunshot, having first made good their mess.Nash: The way you say it...we 'ardly sound like roughs at all.Ringo: We don't, Nash, we don't. Can't 'e make us sound a bit more...cut-throat?Ryunosuke: (It can't just be coincidence that these men showed up at Windibank's that night. There's more to their testimony than meets the eye. I'm sure of it!)Cross-Examination - Illegal Entry: The Whole Truth -Ringo: Alright, so we'd just got inside the gaff and 'eaved a sigh o' relief when the geezer showed 'is mug!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say 'geezer', I presume you mean the victim and proprietor of the shop, Mr Windibank? Ringo: Who else- ...Sorry, I mean, that's right! Nash: We woz keepin' a close eye on the entrance to the gaff, obviously. But we never thought no one woz gonna come outta the back room like that! Ryunosuke: The back room being the pawnbrokery's storeroom? Ringo: Yeah, that must be where 'e popped up from. Only place 'e could've been. Van Zieks: So it would seem the victim was already in the storeroom when these brothers entered the premises. Iris: Which means...Ginny must have been in there at that point as well. Ryunosuke: But that doesn't make sense...does it? If Gina had threatened Mr Windibank into the storeroom with her at gunpoint... ...then why would he have emerged from the same room all alone when the brothers arrived? Iris: Oh, I...don't know... Ryunosuke: Did you see the accused at that time? Ringo: Wot, that moll-tooler? Couldn't tell ya! Nash: No way, cobber! We 'ad bigger fish to fry then! I mean the old geezer just lost it!Nash: 'Gimme that gun!' 'e bellowed, and then 'e flew at us like 'e woz possessed! I thought we'd 'ad it!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You mentioned that Mr Windibank shouted those words in your previous testimony, too. However, you claimed that you heard him yelling them on the other side of the storeroom door. Nash: Oh...um... Hehe. ...Did we? Ryunosuke: But the truth is, he he was shouting those words at you, wasn't he? Nash: Erm...well... Hehe. ...Yeah. Van Zieks: Was the victim - Mr Windibank - wielding a gun at the time? Ringo: Woz 'e ever! Blimey lummy! A great ugly barrel 'e 'ad, pointed straight at me frontispiece! Ryunosuke: So what you're saying is... ...you definitely saw Mr Windibank with the gun at that time. Is that right? Ringo: It is, guv, it is. Spot on. Nash: Then all of a sudden 'e came at us, 'e did! Ringo: It woz bedlam! I didn't know who woz goin' for who! Ryunosuke: ...You were clearly all going for each other. Ringo: Like Nash said, we thought we'd 'ad it. I mean...Ringo: For an old geezer, the bloke woz strong as an ox. 'E chucked me over the counter!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Yes, I noted that you mentioned the counter in your previous testimony, too. Ringo: Well...yeah...'course we did! Nash: 'E knocked over a load o' books, a candlestick and some skull wotnot. Ringo: That got tangled in some marionette, wot knocked over a picture frame, wot knocked them scales on the floor. Ryunosuke: So in fact, it wasn't the sound of the gunshot that shocked you and made you knock those things off the counter? Nash: Well...'big' bruv 'ere went flyin' over that counter like a gunshot, I can tell ya! Then the old geezer pinned 'im! Ringo: 'E did, Nash, 'e did! If you 'adn't been there, the bloke would've flattened me like a bloomin' pancake in seconds! Van Zieks: At the time in question, the alarm was raised at the local police station via a secret cable from the pawnbrokery. There is a button under the counter used to activate it, which was presumably pressed by the victim. Ryunosuke: (That's right... When the brothers fled the scene and back onto the street... ...they ran straight into the arriving police, didn't they?) Iris: Poor Mr Windibank... He did everything he could to protect his shop...Nash: I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Were you intending to shoot Mr Windibank? Nash: Nah nah nah nah! Never! I, I woz just...ya know... Lookin' out fer me bruv, weren't I? 'E woz bein' flattened, don't forget! Ryunosuke: ...By a man whose shop was being burgled, yes. Van Zieks: And then? The man fled into the storeroom when you pointed your gun at him, is that it? Nash: Yeah, that's it. 'E shoved me away, then ran off fru that door an' shut 'imself in! Ryunosuke: ......... (There's something about that last remark... Something that doesn't quite ring true.) Iris: Hm...I wonder why Mr Windibank ran away into the storeroom... Ryunosuke: What? Iris: Well, according to what everyone's saying... ...Ginny was in there waiting for him...with a gun. Ryunosuke: Ah... (Yes, that's right.) Gina allegedly used Mr Windibank's gun to threaten him and force him to open the storeroom door. In which case...how did the gun end up in Mr Windibank's hands again? Iris: I have no idea... But that is strange, isn't it? Ryunosuke: (This little inconsistency could be significant. I should make a mental note of it.) Nash: Look, the point is, me an' me bruv 'ere... Ringo: That's right, Nash, that's right! Me an' me bruv 'ere...Ringo: We never 'ad nuffin' to do wiv killin' 'im! That's all wot 'appened, I swear!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You say you had nothing to do with it? Nash: Nuffin' at all! Ringo: Nuffin', guv, nuffin'! The old geezer went and shut 'imself in the back room, didn't 'e? Nash: Locked, it woz. From the inside. Ringo: We know it woz, cos we tried to open it. Nash: But it's a decent door, that one. Good an' strong. Wouldn't budge an inch! Van Zieks: So in the end, the situation remains unchanged. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Inside the storeroom with the pawnbroker there was only one other person. The sole person  who could possibly have shot the victim: the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade! Ryunosuke: Agh! Judge: Hm... It would indeed appear so. What say you to that, Counsel? Ryunosuke: (I don't know...) Was there anyone else apart from Gina who could possibly have shot Mr Windibank? There's no one else Ryunosuke: (He's right. Gina's the only one. There was no one else in the room!) Iris: With an attitude like that, Runo, it really will be all over. Ryunosuke: (Now a ten-year-old is reading the expression on my face...) Iris: Well, you just don't have that many. Wide-eyed, sweating, smug and happy. That's about it! Ryunosuke: (Surely there's more than that... isn't there?) Iris: Aaanyway...I think you might want to consider some other possibilities here. ...Or rather, I think you have to. Otherwise we won't get anywhere. ...Or rather, YOU won't get anywhere. I'm just here for moral support, remember. Leads back to cross-examination There could have been! Ryunosuke: Mr and Mr Skulkin! Nash: Eh?! Wot? Ringo: Wot's that look for? Ryunosuke: From the moment you admitted that you'd encountered the victim face to face that night... ...the course of this trial changed completely. Nash: It did? Van Zieks: What is your point...my learned friend? Ryunosuke: The question we must answer is who could have shot Mr Windibank. And it is the belief of the defence that the defendant is not the only possible answer at all. Van Zieks: You have my attention. In that case...let us return to this plan of the premises. The victim was killed in the storeroom, which was locked from the inside. Those are the facts. So pray...what other possible answer to the question of who shot the man could there be? Judge: Counsel... ...you must now provide answers to the court in respect of two conundrums. Ryunosuke: Two...My Lord? (...Twice as many chances to be right, maybe?) Judge: Indeed. Namely... ...from what location did the culprit shoot the victim? And furthermore... ...where was the victim at the time? Ryunosuke: ......... Understood, My Lord. Iris: Are you alright, Runo? Ryunosuke: I'm not entirely sure. But there's one thing I am sure about. If I can prove that there's a credible new alternative to what happened... ...it would change Gina's prospects hugely! Van Zieks: So now...time for some clarity. Show the court on this plan the answers to the questions posed by His Lordship. If you believe someone else could have killed the victim, indicate from where that person could have fired the gun! Present anywhere Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence believes that the culprit could have shot the victim from this location here. Van Zieks: ......... And in answer to the second question... Assuming the culprit fired from the location indicated, where was the victim at the time? Present storeroom (after presenting main shop) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The culprit shot the victim from outside the storeroom!\" Present storeroom (after presenting storeroom) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence believes that the victim would have been in this position here. Van Zieks: Van Zieks: What your answers in fact show... ...is that your own position is as absurd as those you have indicated on the plan. Ryunosuke: What are you saying? Judge: What Lord van Zieks is saying, Counsel... ...is that your answers are clearly flawed! Ryunosuke: UWAAAAAAGH! (...I knew it. It's twice as many chances to be wrong.) Iris: So the questions are: from where did the culprit shoot the victim, and where was the victim at the time? Well... ...you have to at least choose a place that's outside the storeroom, don't you? Ryunosuke: Oh... Iris: I mean, if you're saying that someone shot Mr Windibank from inside the storeroom, they'll just say it was Ginny. Ryunosuke: ......... You're right. (What's the best move here? Should I try again, or gather more information first?) Give it a try Ryunosuke: The defence would like to point out the locations again! Van Zieks: Well well, you appear to be a glutton for punishment. Leads back to: \"So now...time for some clarity.\" Leave it Ryunosuke: My Lord, I would like to consider the situation a little more before giving my answers again. Van Zieks: Consider the situation as much as you like. The answers do not exist. Judge: Very well. The court will hear from the witnesses again while you deliberate, Counsel. Leads back to cross-examination Otherwise Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence believes that the victim would have been in this position here. Van Zieks: Van Zieks: What your answers in fact show... ...is that your own position is as absurd as those you have indicated on the plan. Ryunosuke: What are you saying? Judge: What Lord van Zieks is saying, Counsel... ...is that your answers are clearly flawed! Ryunosuke: UWAAAAAAGH! (...I knew it. It's twice as many chances to be wrong.) Iris: So the questions are: from where did the culprit shoot the victim, and where was the victim at the time? Well... ...I don't see why we can't show that someone other than Ginny could have done it in the storeroom, do you? Ryunosuke: Yes, that's the right way of looking at it, I suppose. Someone other than Gina in the storeroom... (What's the best move here? Should I try again, or gather more information first?) Give it a try Ryunosuke: The defence would like to point out the locations again! Van Zieks: Well well, you appear to be a glutton for punishment. Leads back to: \"So now...time for some clarity.\" Leave it Ryunosuke: My Lord, I would like to consider the situation a little more before giving my answers again. Van Zieks: Consider the situation as much as you like. The answers do not exist. Judge: Very well. The court will hear from the witnesses again while you deliberate, Counsel. Leads back to cross-examinationRyunosuke: (So that's all these brothers are willing to reveal this time, is it?)Iris: They're still hiding something, don't you think?Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm sure of it. And not just a minor detail, either.Iris: It was almost certainly because of these two that poor Mr Windibank...well... You can't let them get away with it, Runo!Ryunosuke: I know. (But I get the feeling... ...that there's even less evidence at my disposal this time to prove that they did it.)Iris: We've come so far... Now it's time to finish them off!Ryunosuke: Well, I'll do my best.Ryunosuke: The culprit shot the victim from outside the storeroom!Van Zieks: ......... Continue.Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank died instantly from a bullet wound in his back. Looking at the stain of blood on the storeroom floor, it doesn't appear that the body was moved after death. Which tells us that he was almost certainly shot while he was in the storeroom. However, the crucial point is, where was the shooter when the fatal bullet was fired?Judge: So you are adamant...that the shot was fired from outside the storeroom?Ryunosuke: Well, according to the Skulkin brothers' earlier testimony...Nash: I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!Ryunosuke: If Mr Windibank ran away through the door... ...we have to assume that the door was open at the time.Judge: Ah!Ryunosuke: It was at precisely that moment, when the victim was fleeing for his life... ...that these brothers had the perfect opportunity to shoot the man in the back once he was inside the storeroom!NAAAAAAAAAGH!GAAAAAAAAAGH!Van Zieks: ...!Iris: Come to think of it...do you remember what the prosecutor said at the start of the trial?Van Zieks: Moving on to the findings of Scotland Yard's coroner... His report states that the bullet entered the body on a rising diagonal trajectory.Van Zieks: It means...the victim was likely shot by someone significantly shorter in height than himself.Iris: Poor man... Shot while he was running as fast as he could to safety...Ryunosuke: Ah! Of course! He would have been leaning forward as he was running away. So even if the bullet was fired horizontally, it would still have entered his body on an upward trajectory!Iris: So the culprit isn't necessarily someone shorter than Mr Windibank!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: I'm sure my learned friend can't have forgotten... ...that the storeroom door was found closed, and...locked from the inside. You claim the victim was shot as he fled into the room. Do you also claim his corpse was dexterous enough to turn the key in the lock?Ryunosuke: Agh! But...but... ...what if someone else locked the door? Yes! There is someone else who could have locked the storeroom door!Van Zieks: Is that so?Judge: Very well then, Counsel. Present your hypothesis to the court. In the scenario just described... ...the defence's assertion is that the victim was shot from outside the storeroom. In which case, who shut and locked the storeroom door from the inside?Present Gina Lestrade profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Obviously, the person who locked the door was the only other person inside the storeroom at the time...\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Obviously, that person could only have been... Iris: Just a moment, Runo! Ryunosuke: Hm? What? I'm just about to point dramatically at the prosecution and unveil an amazing revelation! Iris: Sorry, but just before you do, maybe you should take a deep breath and think things through one more time? The storeroom was locked from the inside. So whoever locked it must have been inside, too...don't you think? Ryunosuke: Ah, like Mr Windibank, you mean? Iris: Well yes, except that he was dead. But there's someone else it could have been. Only one other person, really. Ryunosuke: Oh... (Only one other?) Judge: You're out of time, I'm afraid. ...For which you must be penalised. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (There's a time limit?) Judge: Now then, let me pose the question again. Leads back to: \"In the scenario just described...\"Ryunosuke: Obviously, the person who locked the door was the only other person inside the storeroom at the time... ...the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: That's absurd! You're suggesting that the accused deliberately engineered the sealed room? For what possible reason?! Such actions would only serve to tighten the noose around her neck!Judge: I am inclined to agree, I must say. ...Well, Counsel?Ryunosuke: ......... Ah...yes...that's a tricky one, that...isn't it?Judge: Half-baked notions have no place in my courtroom, Counsel. Remember that, please.Iris: But of course Ginny would have locked the door. It almost goes without saying, doesn't it?Ryunosuke: It, it does?Iris: Well if I was Ginny in that situation... ...I know I would have locked the door. As quickly as I could! I mean... ...those two burglars had just fired a gun in her direction, hadn't they?Ryunosuke: (Oh yes! Obviously...) Before the two brothers arrived, Miss Lestrade and Mr Windibank were in the storeroom together. Now...I don't know what went on between them at that time, but at some point... ...Mr Windibank must have heard the intruders breaking into his shop, and left the storeroom.Ringo: Intruders, eh? ...That's us, bruv!Van Zieks: If your theory is correct, that would leave the accused alone in the storeroom.Ryunosuke: ...Yes, it would. Then, probably only moments later, the victim fled back through the storeroom door hoping to escape danger.*BANG!*Ryunosuke: Hit in the back by the bullet, Mr Windibank fell to the floor where he was, just inside the storeroom. And what we have to ask ourselves now is, what would the defendant have done in that moment?Nash: Ah! I, I see where yer goin' wiv this!Ryunosuke: Outside the storeroom was a terrifying killer who had just murdered Mr Windibank. As soon as that thought struck Miss Lestrade, she slammed the door shut and locked it... ...in order to save her own life!Van Zieks: ...!Judge: ...!???:Nash: But, but I ain't- I mean, we ain't the ones who dunnit!Ringo: We ain't, guv, we ain't! You've gotta believe us! I mean, come on! We'd never shoot no one!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: That's blatantly untrue! I know for a fact that you would. Because before my own eyes...you shot Mr Herlock Sholmes!Ringo: ...!Nash: ...!Ryunosuke: There is only one logical conclusion here. Mr and Mr Skulkin, you brothers had every opportunity... ...to have been the true perpetrators of Mr Windibank's murder!Nash: Ah...em...um...Ringo: Erm...em...ugh...NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!Where, where does this leave us? You mean to say it wasn't the pickpocket who shot the pawnbroker after all? I should have known it was those three brothers! They look as shady as a dense forest!Iris: That was amazing, Runo! All the members of the jury seem to be firmly on your side now!Ryunosuke: I know! First time ever! And probably the last...Iris: Well, I think you've done it! Surely they'll have to give a verdict of not-Van Zieks: ...Keh...heh...heh... An admirable effort...my learned friend.Ryunosuke: ...! (What's this now? He's laughing?)Judge: You find the situation amusing, Lord van Zieks? I myself find the defence's argument most persuasive.Van Zieks: I dare say... ...such chicanery is the bread and butter of the street performers in your provincial Eastern nation. But such blatantly malicious conjuring tricks amount to nothing more than inexcusable pettifoggery here.Ryunosuke: What?!Van Zieks: The hypothesis you put forward so ostensibly credibly cannot, and will not stand. Because, you see, it contains a fatal flaw!Ryunosuke: A, a fatal flaw?!Van Zieks: ...Do you mean to tell me that you're unaware of your logic's failing?Juror No. 1: I say! Lord van Zieks... Might be an idea to explain this bally conjuring trick or whatever it is to the troops on the ground, hm?Van Zieks: The fatal flaw in my learned friend's argument is really very simple to understand... ...assuming you're not too dim-witted to count bullets!Juror No. 1: By George! Count bullets?!Iris: Oh dear... ...he noticed then.Ryunosuke: Huh? (What's everyone talking about?)Van Zieks: Counsel!Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, sir?!Van Zieks: Tell the court, how many bullets were found at the scene of the crime?Ryunosuke: Um...two. Two bullets.Van Zieks: Correct. The first, that which hit the victim in the back, ending his life. And the second, that which struck the 'detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes, on his arrival at the scene.Judge: Indeed. The defence presented a picture showing the damage caused by the second bullet earlier in the proceedings. The bullet which injured Mr Sholmes appears to have passed through his body to strike the calendar.Van Zieks: Your Lordship's understanding is correct. Furthermore, we know there are two firearms involved in the incident. The revolver belonging to the victim, Mr Windibank... ...and the Skulkin brothers' revolver. The evidence shows that a single bullet was fired from each gun.Judge: Yes! Indeed it does! A single bullet from each!Van Zieks: Now then, my learned friend...Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: You yourself told the court only moments ago... ...that these two brothers shot Mr Herlock Sholmes right before your eyes.Ryunosuke: Yes, I, I did!Juror No. 3: Oh my goodness! I, I think you'll find...Juror No. 4: That if the single bullet that was fired from the brothers' gun hit Mr Sholmes, it means...Juror No. 5: Windibank not shot by same gun! Stop. Only one bullet! Stop.Van Zieks: ...Exactly. Yes, this Nipponese street performer presented an ostensibly credible argument. ...However! It was never anything more than a diversionary trick with no hope of standing up to scrutiny!Ryunosuke: Ugh............ UWAAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!Van Zieks: ...Pray forgive the discourtesy of flinging the dregs of this hallowed nectar into the public gallery...Judge: L-Lord van Zieks!Van Zieks: ...but this court needs to open its eyes. The accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, is no ordinary little girl. Despite her young years, she can, regrettably, no longer be described as a juvenile. No, the person in the dock is far from a law-abiding citizen. She has a past riddled with criminal conduct!Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Van Zieks: The truth is, the accused broke into the pawnbrokery on the night in question with loathsome intent... ...as we can see beyond doubt in this print which depicts her threatening the victim with the murder weapon!Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Van Zieks: And I have here in my possession one more piece of evidence the prosecution wishes to present.Ryunosuke: ...! (That disk!)Gregson: I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much!Gina: No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!Gregson: I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.Ryunosuke: (Yes, that music box disk... McGilded's music box disk...)Van Zieks: The very day before the hateful murder of Mr Windibank... ...the accused attempted to make off with this article, which clearly doesn't belong to her. And with none of the subtlety of a pickpocket, I might add. But by brute force and brazen impudence.Judge: Good gracious!Van Zieks: Make no mistake! Any sympathy for the accused on account of her years is misguided and dangerous! There are no depths to which this girl would not stoop if pushed. No crime she would not commit. ...The court forgets that fact at its peril.Juror No. 5: ...!Juror No. 6: ...!Judge: Hm...I see... I think it would be prudent to take this music box disk into evidence, Counsel. As a grim testament to the defendant's character.???:Gregson: Um...Lord van Zieks...I, um...Ryunosuke: (Inspector Gregson...what...?)Van Zieks: Yes, Inspector?Gregson: We had a meetin' yesterday at the Yard with the prosecution service, and, um... ...I, I think it was agreed that that disk wouldn't be used as evidence.Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: (What's this all about? Why is the inspector acting strangely? That's the first time he's said anything to van Zieks at all...)Van Zieks: I am unaware of any such meeting.Gregson: But! But those were the instructions, right from the top. The government bigwigs were insistent!Van Zieks: Inspector, I am the prosecutor, and I alone determine how to present my case. Your warning is noted. ...Thank you.Gregson: ...!Van Zieks: The prosecution wishes to proceed with submitting this disk as evidence, My Lord.Judge: In-Indeed. Bailiff!The music box disk has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: The prosecution has established the accused's motive, opportunity and baseness of character. There is nothing more to add. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I await your informed decisions...and rest my case.Examine evidence Music Box Disk Bloodstain Iris: Oh! Runo, look! This is blood! Ryunosuke: Yes, you're right. (Just a small smear, but definitely blood. Actually, I feel as though I might have noticed that before...) Iris: Haha! Then it's my time to shine again! I thought I'd be waiting forever! Alright, hold still with that disk, Runo. Ryunosuke: Can we get this done quickly, Iris? Iris: In a flash! Ooh! A lovely bright shade again. Ryunosuke: ......... (Wait, that colour...) Iris: What is it? Ryunosuke: It's just...that green, it... ...it's not the first time we've seen that colour, is it? The blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record. Bloodstain (subsequent times) Iris: So this is blood! Probably from somebody's fingertip. Ryunosuke: Well deduced. But not just somebody's fingertip... Mr Benedict's fingertip. Iris: The man dressed all in white? Ryunosuke: Yes. It happened that afternoon in Windibank's. Gina tried to snatch this disk out of the man's hands, and the sharp little bumps cut his thumb. Iris: So the lesson is, if someone tries to grab a music box disk from you, let go quickly. Ryunosuke: ...The lesson is don't snatch things, surely? Note on back Iris: 'For McGilded'... That's the man you defended in court a couple of months ago, isn't it, Runo? Ryunosuke: Yes. Or rather, mistakenly defended. Iris: I wonder what his name is doing on the back of this disk... Ryunosuke: That's a question I'd love to know the answer to myself.Ryunosuke: (I don't believe it... I had the jury on my side for once, for all of five minutes...)Iris: Oh dear... It wasn't even for five minutes, Runo...???:My Lord!Juror No. 1: Wonder if I might say something at this point?Judge: Proceed, Mr Foreman.Juror No. 1: Been stumbling about in a bit of a fog up to now, if truth be told. But all of a sudden... ...the answer's bally obvious to me and my men! There's only one thing for it!Ryunosuke: (Oh no!)Judge: Very well. The court will hear from the jury. Ladies and gentlemen, you will present your leanings as to the defendant's culpability.Juror No. 1: Guilty!Juror No. 2: Guilty!Juror No. 3: Guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Guilty!Judge: We have a consensus among the jury, it seems.Van Zieks: When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains...must be the truth.Iris: That's, that's my line! I wrote that! For Hurley! Argh! How dare he use it against us?!Ryunosuke: Don't worry, Iris. I don't think we're finished yet. (There's still more to this case than we realise. There must be, because there's one thing that I'm absolutely certain of. Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank! That's beyond any doubt!)Judge: Very well... ...we will proceed with the second summation examination of the day. Mr Foreman, are you and the other jurors ready?Juror No. 1: Garrideb Squadron is primed and ready for action, sir!Judge: Very good. So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have now determined the defendant to be guilty!Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1: Once a rogue always a rogue, I say...hm? Different breed to us law-abiding citizens!Juror No. 2: As only two bullets were found at the scene, I would say the whole case is done and dusted.Juror No. 3: You don't need a stereoscope to see the truth here. Every which way you look at it, it was that pickpocket!Juror No. 4: Hm...I never imagined that simple operation would cause me such grief...Juror No. 5: The accused attempted a theft on the previous day. ...I can see I'm in for a busy day ahead.Juror No. 6: I am ballistics expert. I have seen many shootings. There is nothing I do not know about guns.Judge: Hmmm... It would seem there is little remaining room for doubt.Juror No. 1: Have to admit, I was rather bowled over by the argument put forward by the chap in black. But when that fell apart like a house of cards, I saw that I'd jolly well been hoodwinked. Well, no more!Ryunosuke: (Ugh...the whole courtroom is turning against me.)Iris: It's not fair!Ryunosuke: Iris?Iris: That prosecutor's being mean! Just because Ginny's done some things she shouldn't have done in the past... ...that doesn't make her a murderer!Van Zieks: Allow me to savour this fruity vintage while I savour the spectacle of your fruitless debate on the matter. Here's to the truth coming out...eventually.Ryunosuke: .........Judge: That's enough preamble. Counsel, proceed with the summation examination.Ryunosuke: ...Yes, My Lord.Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1: Once a rogue always a rogue, I say...hm? Different breed to us law-abiding citizens!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Just because Miss Lestrade has a history of pickpocketing, she must be guilty of murder, is that what you're saying? Juror No. 1: Ah...well... Ryunosuke: Are all members of the British army so quick to judge? Juror No. 1: I beg your pardon? Are you mocking Her Majesty's armed forces? The greatest military organisation in the world! Ryunosuke: No. I'm simply illustrating my point. Juror No. 1: ...! Ryunosuke: Making assumptions about people because they're a soldier...or a pickpocket...is wrong, and dangerous. Juror No. 1: Hmph. Well, yes, might have a point there, I suppose. But let's not forget the girl had already shown she had it in her from before. She's clearly a criminal sort through and through. Can't deny it. Ryunosuke: When you say that she'd 'shown she had it in her'...are you referring to this? Juror No. 1: Exactly. Tried to swipe that only a day earlier, hm? Or am I mistaken? Ryunosuke: ...Not exactly. (Given that I was actually there at the time, it's hard to refute that.) Iris: I've never actually seen the real thing. I can't wait to have a closer look at it! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, of course... Mr Sholmes did use his caramel bars to make a copy of the disk, didn't he. (And then ordered every type of music box he could find from across Europe...) Iris: We still don't know what tune it plays though, do we? But I'd love to see how the original compares to Hurley's copy. Ryunosuke: (McGilded's disk... Could it be a clue somehow? Perhaps we should examine it in more detail...)Juror No. 2: As only two bullets were found at the scene, I would say the whole case is done and dusted.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It's the number of bullets that has you convinced? Juror No. 2: Only two bullets were fired, and the two guns that fired them have been examined by the police. When the parlour maid asks me how many are invited for dinner, I always tell her to count the table settings. Ryunosuke: (Well, that's logical, I suppose.) Juror No. 2: Although... Ryunosuke: Yes? Juror No. 2: ...sometimes after dining, crockery does go missing. One or two guests rather like the fine china. Ryunosuke: ...Does your employer dine with thieves? Juror No. 2: So I suppose... ...if there was another bullet somewhere of which we were unaware... ...I'd have to reconsider my position. Ryunosuke: (...A third bullet somewhere on the scene? Could that be possible?) It's impossible Ryunosuke: Unfortunately... ...only two bullets were discovered by the police during their investigation. Juror No. 2: Yes, I know. Ryunosuke: Right... Juror No. 2: And I don't imagine the good men of Scotland Yard would have overlooked anything. If I missed a bullet while I was cleaning His Lordship's office, well! I should receive a sound scolding, I don't doubt. Ryunosuke: ...And he should receive a visit from the police, perhaps. It sounds like a crime scene to me. Iris: Hm, a third bullet.... Ryunosuke: It would completely turn things around if there was one, wouldn't it? Iris: ...Do you think we might find one lying around somewhere? Leads back to cross-examination I can prove it! Ryunosuke: Allow me to show you, then...the third bullet! Present The Third Bullet Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Here it is.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I, um...don't suppose this would pass as the third bullet? Van Zieks: It passes for a bullet as much as you pass for a lawyer... my learned friend. Ryunosuke: (Coming from you, I'm going to take that as meaning, 'not much'.) Van Zieks: In no way does it resemble a bullet...if that helps your understanding of my last remark. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Judge: Counsel, at the very least I would expect the evidence you present to be of the correct form! Ryunosuke: (...It's been a long day.) Iris: Let's actually try to find this third bullet before we attempt that again, Runo. Leads back to cross-examinationJuror No. 3: You don't need a stereoscope to see the truth here. Every which way you look at it, it was that pickpocket!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So if I've understood correctly, you need two pictures: a left eye one and a slightly different right eye one. Juror No. 3: Eeexactly! Then you can see the scene in three dimensions ...like this! Ryunosuke: So...if we have two bullets...I don't suppose you can see anything useful with them? Juror No. 3: Hm, I think you'll find... ...that no matter how much you squint, the truth of the situation always looks the same here. The only person who could have shot the victim is that girl in the dock! Ryunosuke: How can you be so sure of that? Juror No. 3: Think about it! The Skulkin brothers shot the great detective, didn't they? Ryunosuke: Yes...that's been mentioned once or twice... Juror No. 3: Well then! Surely it's coming into focus now, isn't it? Ryunosuke: (This is a waste of time. I'm not going to change this man's mind any time soon.)Juror No. 4: Hm...I never imagined that simple operation would cause me such grief...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Would you please stop muttering about things that have nothing to do with this trial, sir? The defendant's life is on the line here! Juror No. 4: Hm, well, the thing is... ...I couldn't really say that it is nothing to do with this trial, to be honest. Ryunosuke: Huh? Juror No. 4: I mean, there's no question that the man was shot, but the bullet had simply vanished from his stomach. It's quite inexplicable. ...Don't you think? Ryunosuke: ......... I almost don't want to ask, but this surgery you've been muttering about all this time. You were operating on... Juror No. 4: What was the fellow's name now? Herr Lich? ...No. Herr Loch? ...No. Hairlock? Ryunosuke: Herlock Sholmes by any chance? Juror No. 4: Yes! Good Lord! It was that Hairlock fellow! Ryunosuke: WHAAAT?! You're, you're the surgeon that operated on Mr Sholmes?! Juror No. 4: That's right. Using the very latest anaesthesia techniques, I might add! It was a fairly major op, I can tell you. Ryunosuke: (This is crazy!) Juror No. 4: Let me see, the fellow was brought in not long after midnight, if I remember correctly. They said he'd been shot by some criminal or other. So I opened him up like a shot. But the funny thing is, I went over his insides with a fine-tooth comb, and couldn't find the bullet anywhere. So I'm afraid I had to throw up my hands and just stitch the fellow back up. Ryunosuke: ......... I hate to state the obvious, but... Juror No. 4: Yes? Ryunosuke: ...surely that's because the bullet is still at the scene of the shooting! Judge: The counsel for the defence is correct. As is clearly shown in this photographic print. Ryunosuke: The bullet that the Skulkin brothers fired at Mr Sholmes hit him in the stomach region... ...then exited his body and lodged into the shop wall where the calendar was hanging by the door. I think you'll find it's really quite simple if you just consider the problem three-dimensionally. Juror No. 4: Hah! Who do you think I am, son? Ryunosuke: ...Um, well, 'juror number four' is about the best I can do. Juror No. 4: As soon as I saw the wound to the man's stomach, I flipped him over. Ryunosuke: ...Like a pancake? Are, are you saying that you checked his back? Juror No. 4: Of course I did! And there wasn't a trace of injury. No sign that the bullet had left the body at all! Ryunosuke: What? Juror No. 4: That's the point! The only logical conclusion was that the bullet was still somewhere in the man's innards! Which is exactly why I set about slicing him up! And I'm still none the wiser, even now! How many times do I have to say it? Can somebody please explain how it happened? Can somebody please solve the mystery! Ryunosuke: ...It's almost as much of a mystery as how this jury was put together. Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"The mystery of where that bullet ended up is infuriating! Where's an expert when you need one?\"Juror No. 4: The mystery of where that bullet ended up is infuriating! Where's an expert when you need one?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes's surgeon is on the jury...? I've experienced some coincidences recently, but this is ridiculous. Juror No. 4: I'm as surprised as anyone! Ryunosuke: But there's no question that Mr Sholmes was shot? Juror No. 4: Well, that's what the police told me when they brought him in. Iris: ...How bad were his injuries, doctor? Juror No. 4: He was in a bad way. He'd lost a huge amount of blood, you know. And I suspect he was shot at quite close range, too. Because his skin was badly burnt around the point of entry. Ryunosuke: Burnt? Juror No. 4: As I said, I flipped the fellow over and examined his back, but there was no sign of an exit wound. Which is why I thought I'd better locate the lug and pop it out. Ryunosuke: And yet you say you found no bullet inside the patient? Juror No. 4: Well I wouldn't have done, would I? Because it's in the wall of the pawnbroker's. But how did it get there?! I need someone to solve this mystery before it drives me to insanity! If only there were some expert in ballistics who could help! Even if he looked extremely untrustworthy! Ryunosuke: (So we have a disappearing bullet on our hands...)Pit against Juror No. 6's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict...the idea that all I do is pit jurors against each other! Juror No. 4: Ooh! A ballistics expert! Juror No. 6: 'Pitting'... 'P-i-t-t-...' Ryunosuke: On the night in question, Mr Sholmes was shot by one of the Skulkin brothers. But since there was no sign of an exit wound on his back, we must assume the bullet didn't pass through him. However, no bullet was found lodged in Mr Sholmes's body, either. Furthermore... ...a bullet was found lodged in the wall of the shop where Mr Sholmes was shot. Juror number six... Juror No. 6: 'Hello. My name is Vilen. Pleased to meet you.' Ryunosuke: This apparent contradiction in the facts that is so clearly troubling juror number four... Are you able to explain the mystery? Juror No. 6: ......... I have seen wery similar situation in motherland. Ryunosuke: ...! Juror No. 6: It was night. There was blizzard. I was running away long mountain round in freezing cold. Judge: Golly. Juror No. 6: The snow was piling high on both sides of road. It was wery narrow and dangerous. My pursuers had hunting rifles and they were on dog sleds. Ryunosuke: (...Mental note: don't ask too many questions.) Juror No. 6: I was shot from behind, and I fell down in snow. And this situation was wery similar to what I hear today from doctor. They could not find bullet in my body. And no sign of - how do you say? - exit wound. Judge: Then, then where did the bullet go? Juror No. 6: Bullet never hit me. Juror No. 4: Well if it never hit you, why did you fall down? Juror No. 6: Bullet hit frozen wall of ice wery close to my side. Ryunosuke: What?! Juror No. 6: One small piece - wery sharp - broke away from lump of ice and pierced my body. It made deep wound that looks just like bullet wound. Juror No. 4: Good gracious... Juror No. 6: Of course, piece of ice quickly melted inside me. And that is solution to mystery of disappearing bullet. Ryunosuke: ......... Juror No. 6: ......... Juror No. 4: But, but that doesn't answer the question at all! Ryunosuke: Hm? Juror No. 4: The shooting happened in a pawnbroker's shop... ...not some snowy mountain road in another country! Ryunosuke: ......... ...Just an idea, but we might not be looking at EXACTLY the same scenario here. Iris: Runo... ...where exactly was Hurley shot again? Ryunosuke: Um, well, according to the report, in his stomach. Sort of around this area, I think. Iris: Well...that's precisely where he always wears a little pouch on his belt. Ryunosuke: A pouch? (Actually, I might have noticed something like that.) Iris: Yes, a pouch. It's where he keeps three glass phials of very dangerous chemicals that he uses in his investigations. Ryunosuke: What?! (Really?) Doctor! Where is the pouch Mr Sholmes was wearing? Juror No. 4: Hm, well... ...the fellow had nothing like that on his person when he arrived at the hospital as far as I remember. Van Zieks: If I may... Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks...? Van Zieks: While I realise it is forbidden for the prosecution to interject during a summation examination... ...I should inform the defence that I have the pouch in question in the antechamber outside the courtroom. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: As I understand it, when the police arrived on the scene and found Mr Sholmes injured... ...they removed the pouch in order to assess the wound. Juror No. 4: Ah! Thank goodness. I thought I was getting forgetful for a moment! Van Zieks: Since then, it has been in my safekeeping along with all other evidence relating to the case. I can personally vouch for the fact that it has not been touched since the incident occurred. Judge: Very well. While extremely unconventional during a summation examination... ...I must demand the prosecution presents the item in question with all speed. Bring forth Mr Herlock Sholmes's pouch! Judge: Hm, I see... So this is the pouch worn by Mr Sholmes on the night in question, is it? Ryunosuke: Look at that! One of the phials is broken and the leather around it is scorched black! It's almost as if...the phial exploded! Judge: Exploded? Ryunosuke: So...that night... ...the bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun struck Mr Sholmes's pouch. Juror No. 4: And it was the glass phial exploding that caused the fellow's injury! Juror No. 6: The bullet did not penetrate wictim, but was deflected into wall of shop. Van Zieks: ......... ...A delightfully complex aroma. Judge: Well, it would appear one mystery has been solved at least. Van Zieks: Though it has no bearing on the truth of this case. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: The bungling and burgling brothers shot the detective, and the accused shot the pawnbroker. The pertinent facts of the case remain unaltered. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 4: But at least the mystery is solved! I can sleep easy tonight! Thank you, young man! Juror No. 6: ...Da. 'Thank you wery much.' Ryunosuke: ...Glad I could help. Judge: Due to its bearing on the conundrum just solved, the court will sequester this scruffy pouch as evidence. Iris: Hurley's pouch isn't scruffy! Sholmes's pouch has been entered into the Court Record. Judge: Now, the summation examination... It would appear the defence is somewhat struggling to alter opinion, hm? Ryunosuke: Please, My Lord! A little more time. (After all, that's a new piece of evidence. It could be a valuable clue. And you can't afford to overlook anything here, Ryunosuke. There's still a way to turn this around...somehow. I'm sure of it!) Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.\"Examine evidence Sholmes's Pouch Scorch mark on left side Ryunosuke: (It's really scorched badly just here...) Iris: Oh! The strap is broken, look! Ryunosuke: This must be where the bullet hit, then. Iris: Let me see... Bullet Ryunosuke: Wh-What the... Iris! Look! Behind where the broken phial was... Do you see it? Iris: AAAH! That's... ...the Skulkin brothers' bullet! Ryunosuke: (What a stroke of luck that it hit his pouch!) This is an amazing discovery! (What this means is... ...there were three bullets fired at Windibank's that night!) Iris: We've found exactly what that juror was talking about! The third bullet! Ryunosuke: It's time to press that juror again, I think! The third bullet has been entered into the Court Record. Bullet hole (after examining bullet) Ryunosuke: (This is where the third bullet was lodged. Imagine what would have happened if it had pierced the leather... Thank goodness Mr Sholmes is going to be alright.) Scorch mark on left side (after examining bullet) Ryunosuke: (It's really scorched badly just here...) Iris: Yes, the strap is broken. Ryunosuke: Ripped apart by the bullet, obviously.  Iris: Let me see... Hole on back Ryunosuke: Oh look...there's a hole here at the back. (It doesn't look much like a bullet hole. But clearly something's ripped through the leather with great force.) Iris: Something must have pierced it somehow to have left this hole behind. Ryunosuke: Yes, it looks that way. Mr Sholmes and his pouch both took a beating, didn't they? Broken vial Ryunosuke: This phial has been smashed to pieces. Presumably this is where the bullet struck. Iris: As soon as the bullet hit the chemical in that phial, there would have been a really big explosion. Ryunosuke: A big explosion?! Iris: Well Hurley's potions and chemicals are amazingly useful for the investigation work he does. But they're also quite tricky to handle. Safely, at least. They're very dangerous. Ryunosuke: Oh. Iris: I'm sure that when this phial broke, the chemical inside would have ignited. Ryunosuke: ......... (Note to self: Always walk on the right-hand side of Sholmes in future. The left is the danger zone.) Intact vials Iris: These glass phials are full of Hurley's homemade potions. Ryunosuke: Homemade...? Iris: Yes, like fingerprint powder to show up where people have touched things... ...and scent-amplifying solution to intensify a smell lingering on an object. Ryunosuke: That's...amazing. Iris: They're all very easy to use. There's just one thing that you have to be careful of: They're all very flammable. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes is a walking bomb! (Either he's passionate about finding out the truth, or just oblivious to the dangers...) The Third Bullet Bullet Ryunosuke: This is the bullet that was fired from the Skulkin brothers' gun on the night of the incident. Iris: Yes. So it turns out it never actually entered Hurley's body at all. Ryunosuke: Thanks to the thick leather of that pouch he was wearing. It saved him. Iris: Hehe, Hurley's always lucky like that. Ryunosuke: Well...considering what he had to go through in hospital... ...I wonder how lucky he really was. Iris: Oh dear...poor Hurley...Juror No. 4: Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Then I ask you to reconsider your leaning, sir! Juror No. 4: Oh no, that's another matter entirely. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Juror No. 4: All I can think about for the moment...is this wonderful sense of relief I have that the mystery is solved. I need some time to let that sink in before I could possibly consider anything else. Ryunosuke: Alright... (I thought surgeons had to be able to think quickly...) Iris: Perhaps we should leave him alone for now while he savours his inner peace... ...and focus on some of the other jurors? Ryunosuke: I suppose we'll have to. ...I wish I had the chance to experience inner peace sometimes.Juror No. 5: The accused attempted a theft on the previous day. ...I can see I'm in for a busy day ahead.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you mean, you're in for a busy day? Juror No. 5: Forgot to say. Stop. Do excuse me. Stop. I am a communications officer. Stop. Ryunosuke: A communications officer? Does that have something to do with sending telegrams? Juror No. 5: Everything from personal messages written by members of the public to the latest news in the capital. I convert all the messages into morse code and tap it out to the entire world electronically. Ryunosuke: To...the entire world? Juror No. 5: Thousands of miles of cable under the sea! Stop. Worldwide communication network! Stop. Information transmitted to and from all corners of globe! Stop. Ryunosuke: (Ah yes... ...she was getting equally worked up about radio waves or the like before, wasn't she?) Juror No. 5: I specialise in communicating information from government departments and newspaper offices. Ryunosuke: I see. Juror No. 5: I'm sure I shall have to wire the newspaper reports of today's guilty verdict later. So no sleep for me tonight, I imagine. Ryunosuke: (...Let's just finish the trial first, shall we?)Juror No. 6: I am ballistics expert. I have seen many shootings. There is nothing I do not know about guns.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I thought...you were just a tourist? Juror No. 6: ......... 'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.' Ryunosuke: (...There's no way he's just a 'wisiting' tourist.) So...you're a ballistics expert? ...Who knew? Juror No. 6: I have much experience with guns. Ryunosuke: Ah. Juror No. 6: I have lived through many - how do you say? Em... Extreme...em...wiolent...bath of...em... No. Blood of...em... Iris: Ah! Extreme violent bloodbaths, perhaps? Juror No. 6: Da! Those! Extreme wiolent bloodbaths! ...English is wery difficult language. Ryunosuke: (...Considering the sort of people you associate with, I'm surprised you still have a tongue.) Juror No. 6: Anyway. If you have questions about bullets and guns, you ask me. There is nothing I do not know. No mystery I cannot solve. Ryunosuke: (He's very confident in his knowledge of guns, that's for sure.) Juror No. 6: But...if possible, please, only in Russian language. Iris: He's not very confident in his knowledge of English, though, is he? Ryunosuke: No... Still, we should bear it in mind. (He's our man if there's a mystery about guns or bullets.)Pit against Juror No. 4's statement (after Juror No. 4 changes his statement, before Juror No. 4 changes his statement a second time) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict...the idea that all I do is pit jurors against each other! Juror No. 4: Ooh! A ballistics expert! Juror No. 6: 'Pitting'... 'P-i-t-t-...' Ryunosuke: On the night in question, Mr Sholmes was shot by one of the Skulkin brothers. But since there was no sign of an exit wound on his back, we must assume the bullet didn't pass through him. However, no bullet was found lodged in Mr Sholmes's body, either. Furthermore... ...a bullet was found lodged in the wall of the shop where Mr Sholmes was shot. Juror number six... Juror No. 6: 'Hello. My name is Vilen. Pleased to meet you.' Ryunosuke: This apparent contradiction in the facts that is so clearly troubling juror number four... Are you able to explain the mystery? Juror No. 6: ......... I have seen wery similar situation in motherland. Ryunosuke: ...! Juror No. 6: It was night. There was blizzard. I was running away long mountain round in freezing cold. Judge: Golly. Juror No. 6: The snow was piling high on both sides of road. It was wery narrow and dangerous. My pursuers had hunting rifles and they were on dog sleds. Ryunosuke: (...Mental note: don't ask too many questions.) Juror No. 6: I was shot from behind, and I fell down in snow. And this situation was wery similar to what I hear today from doctor. They could not find bullet in my body. And no sign of - how do you say? - exit wound. Judge: Then, then where did the bullet go? Juror No. 6: Bullet never hit me. Juror No. 4: Well if it never hit you, why did you fall down? Juror No. 6: Bullet hit frozen wall of ice wery close to my side. Ryunosuke: What?! Juror No. 6: One small piece - wery sharp - broke away from lump of ice and pierced my body. It made deep wound that looks just like bullet wound. Juror No. 4: Good gracious... Juror No. 6: Of course, piece of ice quickly melted inside me. And that is solution to mystery of disappearing bullet. Ryunosuke: ......... Juror No. 6: ......... Juror No. 4: But, but that doesn't answer the question at all! Ryunosuke: Hm? Juror No. 4: The shooting happened in a pawnbroker's shop... ...not some snowy mountain road in another country! Ryunosuke: ......... ...Just an idea, but we might not be looking at EXACTLY the same scenario here. Iris: Runo... ...where exactly was Hurley shot again? Ryunosuke: Um, well, according to the report, in his stomach. Sort of around this area, I think. Iris: Well...that's precisely where he always wears a little pouch on his belt. Ryunosuke: A pouch? (Actually, I might have noticed something like that.) Iris: Yes, a pouch. It's where he keeps three glass phials of very dangerous chemicals that he uses in his investigations. Ryunosuke: What?!

Van Zieks: While I realise it is forbidden for the prosecution to interject during a summation examination... ...I should inform the defence that I have the pouch in question in the antechamber outside the courtroom. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: As I understand it, when the police arrived on the scene and found Mr Sholmes injured... ...they removed the pouch in order to assess the wound. Juror No. 4: Ah! Thank goodness. I thought I was getting forgetful for a moment! Van Zieks: Since then, it has been in my safekeeping along with all other evidence relating to the case. I can personally vouch for the fact that it has not been touched since the incident occurred. Judge: Very well. While extremely unconventional during a summation examination... ...I must demand the prosecution presents the item in question with all speed. Bring forth Mr Herlock Sholmes's pouch! Judge: Hm, I see... So this is the pouch worn by Mr Sholmes on the night in question, is it? Ryunosuke: Look at that! One of the phials is broken and the leather around it is scorched black! It's almost as if...the phial exploded! Judge: Exploded? Ryunosuke: So...that night... ...the bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun struck Mr Sholmes's pouch. Juror No. 4: And it was the glass phial exploding that caused the fellow's injury! Juror No. 6: The bullet did not penetrate wictim, but was deflected into wall of shop. Van Zieks: ......... ...A delightfully complex aroma. Judge: Well, it would appear one mystery has been solved at least. Van Zieks: Though it has no bearing on the truth of this case. Ryunosuke: ...!

Juror No. 4: But at least the mystery is solved! I can sleep easy tonight! Thank you, young man! Juror No. 6: ...Da. 'Thank you wery much.' Ryunosuke: ...Glad I could help. Judge: Due to its bearing on the conundrum just solved, the court will sequester this scruffy pouch as evidence. Iris: Hurley's pouch isn't scruffy! Sholmes's pouch has been entered into the Court Record. Judge: Now, the summation examination... It would appear the defence is somewhat struggling to alter opinion, hm? Ryunosuke: Please, My Lord! A little more time. (After all, that's a new piece of evidence. It could be a valuable clue. And you can't afford to overlook anything here, Ryunosuke. There's still a way to turn this around...somehow. I'm sure of it!) Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.\"Before Sholmes's Pouch is added to Court Record Ryunosuke: (Van Zieks has managed to convince everyone...) Iris: 'When you have eliminated the impossible...' he said. But he hasn't! Ryunosuke: (If we're going to fight back, we need more material. And we have to fight back! We have to turn this trial around again!)After Sholmes's Pouch is added to Court Record Iris: Hurley always turns up at just the right moment! Ryunosuke: ...Does he always come in the form of a pouch? (Seriously though, it sounds like the great detective was on death's door. But maybe his injuries won't be for nothing. That pouch could be a very valuable clue.)Ryunosuke: Here it is. We discovered it just now. Yes! On the night in question in Windibank's pawnbrokery...another bullet was fired!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: What is this new trickery, you Nipponese conjurer?! Where did you find that bullet?Ryunosuke: It was lodged inside Mr Sholmes's pouch.Van Zieks: What?!Ryunosuke: This pouch was removed from around Mr Sholmes's waist before he was taken to hospital. And since then, it has been touched by no one.Judge: Do, do you mean to say... ...the shot fired by the Skulkin brothers that night...Ryunosuke: Yes. As your Lordship has surmised...it hit this pouch.Judge: But that makes no sense whatsoever! We already know the whereabouts of the bullet fired at Mr Sholmes. It's clearly visible in this photographic print!Juror No. 1: Ah!Ryunosuke: Two guns from the scene have already been submitted into the Court Record as evidence.Judge: Yes. That of Mr Windibank, and that belonging to the Skulkin brothers.Ryunosuke: And examination of both guns revealed... ...that only a single bullet had been fired from each.Juror No. 2: Ah!Juror No. 3: But, but that must mean...Ryunosuke: That's right. We now know that on the night in question, three bullets were fired. However! Only two bullets were fired from the guns recovered from the crime scene! And until that incontrovertible inconsistency is somehow explained... ...we cannot and must not pass judgement!Van Zieks: Agk......... AAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! While this summation examination remains incomplete, the court has been presented with new facts. Facts that would appear to shake the very foundations upon which the case against the defendant has been built.Van Zieks: ...!Judge: As is my prerogative in this situation... ...I hereby temporarily suspend the summation examination.Juror No. 1: By Jupiter!Ryunosuke: What?!Judge: Bailiff! Bring the witnesses back to the stand at once!Judge: Witnesses...Nash: Guvnor!Judge: Were you listening to proceedings while the defence carried out the summation examination?Ringo: We woz, guvnor, we woz!Van Zieks: Perhaps we can dispense with the tedious preamble. Simply answer this one question: A third bullet has been identified at the scene of the crime. ...What do you make of that?Nash: Make of it, guv? I dun't make nuffin' of nuffin' if I can 'elp it. Um...Van Zieks: Is it one of yours?Ringo: Gorblimey, guv, gorblimey! Not a chance!Van Zieks: In that case...did you have an accomplice?Nash: Wot?! Eh? Wot?! Never! The Skulkin bruvvers work alone!Ringo: It's just the two of us! That's our trademark!Ryunosuke: (...How soon we forget poor Sulky...)Van Zieks: Only two of the bullets from the crime scene originated from the firearms we have in evidence. The third bullet was fired from another gun. ...Where is it?Nash: Lummy...that's an 'ead-scratcher... .........Judge: Hmmm... Counsel for the Defence...Ryunosuke: Y-Yes?Judge: I should like to hear your thoughts regarding these new developments. The third bullet...and the mysterious missing firearm from whence it came.Ryunosuke: (Thinking back over all the testimony we've heard and all the evidence we've seen... ...I think I'm starting to form a picture. A picture of what really happened that night.) My Lord, I think it's clear what this third bullet tells us about the Skulkin brothers:They had a secret accomplice Ryunosuke: On that night at Windibank's pawnbrokery...the brothers must have been working with a third man. Nash: Erm... Ryunosuke: The witnesses are clearly doing their best to cover up the existence of this accomplice... ...but the evidence all points to the fact that there was someone else present! Someone carrying a gun! Van Zieks: Leads to: \"...An accomplice, you say?\"They had another gun Ryunosuke: On that night at Windibank's pawnbrokery...the brothers must have been in possession of another gun. Nash: Erm... Ryunosuke: We know that only one bullet was fired from each of the two firearms already in the Court Record. The logical conclusion, therefore... ...is that the brothers were working with an accomplice! An accomplice who was carrying a gun! Leads to: \"...An accomplice, you say?\"It's nothing to do with them Ryunosuke: I believe...it has nothing to do with them. Nash: Eh? Ringo: Eh, Nash, eh! That's right! Nash: Yeah! Nuffin' to do wiv us, guv! Ryunosuke: We've established that one bullet was fired from each of the two guns already known to the court. The logical conclusion therefore, is that on the night in question at Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery... ...there was another person present in possession of a third firearm. Van Zieks: ...! Ryunosuke: Whilst the brothers may have had nothing to do with the third gun or the bullet fired from it... ...it's inconceivable that they had nothing to do with the third man. Yes! The brothers were working with an accomplice! An accomplice who was carrying a gun! Leads to: \"...An accomplice, you say?\"Van Zieks: ...An accomplice, you say? Pigswill.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: These protracted proceedings have already forced us to endure two summation examinations. Yet in all that time, there has been not a murmur of a third man. If this apparently wraithlike being exists... ...the court must be shown hard evidence! Without it, this fantasy will be crushed.Ryunosuke: Agh!Van Zieks: The prosecution demands answers on two counts: Firstly: proof - evidence - that this accomplice was ever at the scene of the crime. And secondly... ...the identity of this spurious character.Ryunosuke: (The Skulkins are lying. I know that. But... ...how can I ascertain the identity of the person they're hiding?)Judge: Well, Counsel?Ryunosuke: ......... (I'm supposed to prove the existence of this accomplice... and reveal the person's identity, even...) In response to the prosecution's demands, My Lord, the defence is...Ready to present answers Ryunosuke: The defence is ready. I believe I can provide all the answers the prosecution demands. Van Zieks: So, my Nipponese friend, despite the swimming eyes, you seem to think you have something to say. This promises to be interesting. Ryunosuke: (I have to push forward now. There's no other option. I need to use every single piece of evidence available to me if it will make a difference...) Leads to: \"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Unable to present answers Ryunosuke: The defence is... ......... Van Zieks: Unable to complete a sentence, it would seem. Much less provide any credible answers here. Judge: Yes, it would appear so. Very well, this trial will now- Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Wait! Please! Judge: Good gracious, Counsel! Ryunosuke: (I have to keep the momentum going here. I can't give up now!) Iris: This is just like scientific research if you ask me. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: When you start doubting yourself and thinking you can't possibly work something out, you become blind. Even though in truth, the answer you're looking for is right there in front of you. Ryunosuke: (The answer...is right here in front of me!) ...My Lord! Actually...the defence would like to present answers to the questions posed by the prosecution. Van Zieks: Van Zieks: So, my Nipponese friend, despite the swimming eyes, you seem to think you have something to say. But your earlier tongue-tied display will not go unpunished. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (Now I wish I'd bit my tongue instead of speaking before I'd made up my mind. It would have hurt less.) Leads to: \"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Judge: In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay. On the night in question, in the moments leading up to the death of the victim... ...what proof have you that there was a third intruder present at the scene?Present Blood Samples Portfolio Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The evidence is right here...in this portfolio.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The evidence...is this! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: My learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Ryunosuke: The evidence is right here...in this portfolio.Judge: By Jove! That portfolio again, is it?Van Zieks: Do you expect the court to rifle through your papers itself? Be more specific!Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: You claim one of those blood samples proves the presence of this third intruder. Well, which one is it?Present Windibank's Main Shop sample Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"What am I looking at here?\"Present any other sample Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: THIS is the blood sample that proves it! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"You claim one of those blood samples proves the presence of this third intruder.\"Judge: What am I looking at here? There appears to be some green paint or suchlike around the bullet hole in the middle of the calendar.Ryunosuke: That's a bloodstain, My Lord.Judge: A bloodstain?Van Zieks: Green blood? Curious, even for you. Is the court to understand that the intruder was some unhuman creature?Ryunosuke: It's...something developed by Mr Herlock Sholmes.Juror No. 3: By the great detective!Juror No. 5: New invention! Stop. Not yet appeared in stories! Stop.Iris: It's this, you see. It...doesn't have a name yet, though. This fogger sprays a chemical that reacts with the different elements in people's blood to change its colour.Judge: Different elements...of people's blood...?Iris: Yes. Everyone's blood is slightly different, you see. Because it's made up of different elements. So by seeing what colour it changes to, you can tell in a flash whose blood it is!Juror No. 3: Ooh! That brings a whole extra dimension to looking at blood!Juror No. 5: Talk of blood in courtroom! Stop. Very exciting! Stop.Ryunosuke: As an example, this one shows the blood of the victim, Mr Windibank.Judge: Ah... A striking blue.Ryunosuke: Yes. So you see, the green colour of this bloodstain on the calendar... ...shows that somebody else was shot in the main part of the shop!Juror No. 1: Now hold fire there, young man! Could be from some unrelated incident, couldn't it?Ryunosuke: No. It's not unrelated.Juror No. 1: ...!Ryunosuke: The date showing on the calendar is the date on which Mr Windibank was killed.Juror No. 1: By golly!Ryunosuke: Therefore we can assume that whoever was shot, was shot on the same day.Juror No. 4: Then whose blood is it?!Ryunosuke: Well, the Skulkin brothers in the stand don't appear to be suffering from any gunshot injuries... Which means it must be the blood of somebody else. The third intruder, in fact.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Whose identity the court is still waiting to hear. You can't delay this any longer, my learned friend. Who is this alleged third intruder?Present Eggert Benedict profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The man's name...is Eggert Benedict.\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: There can be no doubt! THIS is the shadowy accomplice the brothers have been trying so hard to protect! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: A lottery? Is that how you decide who's guilty? Ryunosuke: Hm? Van Zieks: In that case, the name Ryunosuke Naruhodo should be added to the draw. For being guilty of incompetence! Ryunosuke: GAAAAAAGH! (...And I bet my lot would be drawn, too.) Iris: The identity of this accomplice is our trump card, Runo.  Ryunosuke: Yes...I, I expect it is... Iris: At this point, we're the only ones who know the person's identity. But it's time to stun the courtroom now! Let's give everyone something to think about! Ryunosuke: Yes... YES! Leads back to: \"You can't delay this any longer, my learned friend.\"!Ryunosuke: The man's name...is Eggert Benedict.Judge: Eggert Benedict?! Who on earth are you talking about, Counsel?Ryunosuke: He paid a visit to Windibank's pawnbrokery on the afternoon before the incident took place.Van Zieks: When the accused attempted to deceive the pawnbroker into releasing this article into her possession.Ryunosuke: ...That's right.Van Zieks: ...!Ryunosuke: The man identified by the defence, Mr Eggert Benedict... ...then attempted to take the article from the defendant by force.???: Broker!Windibank: Um, yes, sir????: I believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemed an article from you, no?Windibank: Yes, yes, erm...???: The article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once.Gina: Now that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull????: Give me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box disks, too.Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson was there at the time, and can attest to what happened. In the end, it was the inspector himself who took the disk.Judge: Can you corroborate this account, Inspector?Gregson: Erm, yes, My Lord. That's more or less what happened. And in the interests of bein' thorough, I asked Windibank for a print showin' the fellow. Taken from one of his 'Red-Handed Recorder' gubbinses.Ryunosuke: (Yes! That's him talking to Mr Windibank that morning.)Judge: And you claim this man is the brothers' accomplice?Ryunosuke: Well, Mr and Mr Skulkin?Nash: ......... Never seen the geezer before in me life!Ringo: On me life, guv, on me life! Never seen 'im!Judge: Well...somewhat unsurprisingly, it appears our witnesses disagree with the assertion.Van Zieks: I'm sure Your Lordship recalls my learned Nipponese friend's actual assertion. Which was that he could prove the identity of the alleged accomplice.Ryunosuke: Yes, and I can!Juror No. 3: Then show us the evidence!Juror No. 2: I agree! We must see proof that the clean-cut gentleman in the photograph is the filthy criminal you say he is!Ryunosuke: ......... (This is the last piece of evidence... I've had a feeling that something has been missing in this trial from the very start. But now...I'm going to drag it kicking and screaming into the courtroom!)Judge: Are you ready to present your answer to the court then, Counsel?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. The defence will present the evidence now. Proof that the man pictured in this photographic print was in fact the person struck by the third bullet!Present Music Box Disk (after examining bloodstain during trial) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question...\"Present Blood Samples Portfolio Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That proof is right here, in this portfolio! Judge: Good gracious, Counsel! Does that portfolio contain the answers to every question posed? Van Zieks: ...I see you share my interest in claret-coloured liquids, my Nipponese friend. But... Enough. The court demands to see further evidence. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Which blood sample proves the man you identified was the one shot by the third bullet at the scene of the crime? Present Music Box Disk sample Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question...\" Present any other sample Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: THIS is the blood sample that proves it! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! (It has to be a sample that links the bloodstain at the scene to Mr Benedict...) Iris: In other words, we need a sample of blood that turned the same colour as that bloodstain. Ryunosuke: (Another green sample? ...Did we have one of those?) Iris: I think perhaps you should have another look through everything, Runo. Ryunosuke: Right. I might need to go over the evidence again. (Where else did we notice a bloodstain?) Leads back to: \"Enough. The court demands to see further evidence.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Here it is! This is the irrefutable evidence! Judge: I'm sorry, Counsel, but I fail to see the connection. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: It seems my learned friend is wide of the mark...again. In fact...he has just shot himself in the foot! Ryunosuke: GYAAAAAAGH! (I'll have to try that one more time. Even though my foot is killing me here...) Judge: I might remind you, Counsel, of the gravity of the choices you make in this courtroom. Think very carefully. Leads back to: \".........\"Ryunosuke: As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question... ...the defendant attempted - deceitfully, admittedly - to reclaim this disk from Windibank's.Judge: Which is when the aforementioned Eggert Benedict appeared on the scene, I believe. This man then attempted to purloin the article from the defendant's possession, no?Ryunosuke: That's correct, My Lord. I myself was present at the time. It was following this that a minor incident occurred.Windibank: But of course, sir. Here is the disk for you.Benedict: ......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style.Gina: Wait a minute! That disk... ...is mine!Benedict: Argh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal!Ryunosuke: Being a music box disk, it has countless small but sharp metal protrusions over its surface. Those protrusions caused Mr Benedict's finger to bleed. And the resulting smear of blood is still visible on the disk now.Judge: Goodness! A bloodstain, is it?Ryunosuke: My assistant and I have just analysed the bloodstain here in this very courtroom.Iris: Using...my trusty fogger gun!Ryunosuke: Yes. And we added the results to this portfolio.Juror No. 1:I say!Juror No. 2:It's green!Juror No. 5:It's exactly the same colour as the blood around the calendar!Ryunosuke: The evidence is conclusive! The man calling himself Mr Eggert Benedict, who was in Windibank's earlier in the day... ...is the accomplice who was present at the scene of the crime that same night!So there was someone else there! Look at those two brothers now! They're sweating buckets!Oi! Who are you talkin' about? ...It's boilin' in 'ere!Ryunosuke: My Lord! It is the opinion of the defence... ...that Mr Eggert Benedict...should be summoned to the courtroom to testify!Judge: Hmmm... It would certainly seem that we can ill afford to ignore this gentleman's apparent presence.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ...This has gone on long enough now. This flagrant ignorance of the mechanics of law.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: Herlock Sholmes, you say? Yes, I've heard the name. The protagonist in a series of short stories for the vulgar classes. A god of detection or some such.Iris: ...!Van Zieks: And now you employ chemical substances devised by this fantastical persona in the highest court in the land? Do you expect us to take you seriously? The samples made by this plaything are not fit to be called evidence.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: So the bloodstain turned a shade of green. What of it? Here's to you successfully proving that no other blood in the world would turn the same colour.Ryunosuke: Ah...well...Van Zieks: And pray, do not even think of suggesting that we should take Mr Sholmes's word for it!Ryunosuke: Ugh...Is he right? Is Mr Sholmes's concoction a load of rubbish? I don't know... I mean, he is a great detective.What are you talking about?! We can't let him get away with that!Ryunosuke: ......... (I knew it would come to this. Of course Mr Sholmes's invention isn't going to be recognised by any official body. But...what other choice did I have...?)Iris: Hm... I'm just remembering what Father Christmas over there said before. About how he was temporarily suspending the summation examination.Ryunosuke: Ah!Iris: In other words... ...the examination isn't over yet, is it?Judge: G-Good grief! What did you just say, young girl?Iris: And in a summation examination, the decision as to whether or not the trial continues... ...is in the hands of the six jurors, isn't it?Van Zieks: ...!Iris: So the way I see it... ...it doesn't matter what certain other people think of Hurley's invention. At least, not for now!Ryunosuke: Yes! (She's right!)Judge: Young lady, you have quite the devious mind!Iris: It really just comes down to one thing: Whether these ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...are convinced by what you say, Runo! ...Is that about right, would you say? Or did I misunderstand something?Ryunosuke: (Unbelievable! Mr Sholmes's partner is a force to be reckoned with!)Iris: Iris Wilson...sharpshooter!Judge: After that shrewd precis of the situation from an entirely unexpected source... ...it must be acknowledged that the previous summation examination has yet to reach its conclusion.Van Zieks: This is absurd!Judge: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the court now looks to you for your final leanings in this matter.Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Judge: As proud citizens of Her Majesty's Britain, I'm sure you will come to fair and just conclusions.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Judge: So then, state your final decisions in turn, please.Juror No. 1: Not guilty!Juror No. 2: Not guilty!Juror No. 3: Not guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Not guilty!Judge: Two call guilty, and four call not guilty. Such is the outcome of the summation examination.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: My Lord, with all due respect, this is an outrage! The prosecution refuses to accept this decision!Judge: ...On what grounds?Van Zieks: If these jurors are persuaded by some half-baked concoction devised by a pretender to real police work... ...then they are too ignorant to be trusted with the judgement of anyone's guilt.Judge: I'm sorry, Lord van Zieks, but the outcome of the summation examination cannot be ignored. This trial will continue!Van Zieks: Agk......... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge: ...Nevertheless, we find ourselves in a rather awkward situation. The defence has very reasonably requested the subpoena of a new witness. But sadly, I fear that will be impossible.Ryunosuke: What?Judge: The name the gentleman gave for himself - Eggert Benedict - is quite clearly false.Ryunosuke: (I don't believe it! Just when I'd managed to prove the man was there that night...)???:...Um... Could, could I say something?Judge: ...? Who was that, please? Who spoke?Juror No. 5: Um...it was me, My Lord.Ryunosuke: (Juror number five...?)Judge: What have you to say, madam?Juror No. 5: If possible...Inspector...Gregson: Eh? ...Me, ma'am?Juror No. 5: I wonder if you might show the photographic print to me again? The one in which the gentleman is shown.Gregson: Ah, right, yes. This one, you mean? Of Mr Benedict?Juror No. 5: ......... ......... .........Yes... There's no doubt in my mind.Ryunosuke: Juror number five, you don't mean to say... You know this man?Juror No. 5: Yes, I know him.Ryunosuke: What?!Van Zieks: No!Judge: GOOD GRACIOUS!!! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Juror number five! How on earth...?Juror No. 5: I am a communications officer. Stop.Ryunosuke: ...As we can clearly see...Juror No. 5: The gentleman in the photograph is... Stop. ...also a communications officer. Stop. He works in my office. Stop. A very talented operator in fact! Stop. He should be in the communication station now. Stop. Tapping away on the telegraph. Stop.Ryunosuke: (This doesn't seem right somehow... I can't put my finger on why, but...it doesn't feel right.)Iris: Hm... I suppose we all imagined the accomplice would be some sort of hardened criminal. It's...a bit unexpected to find out that he has a respectable job by day, whatever he gets up to at night.Ryunosuke: Yes...I suppose that's it. (I suppose that's why I felt something was wrong...)Judge: If the gentleman is at London's communication station, we should be able to subpoena him within the hour. Lord van Zieks, if you please...Van Zieks: ...Yes, My Lord?Judge: Make the necessary arrangements with all haste!Van Zieks: As Your Lordship bids.Judge: The court will recess for one hour. When the new witness arrives, we shall reconvene to hear the gentleman's testimony. Inspector Gregson...Gregson: Yes, My Lord?Judge: I should like to hear from you specifically about events at the pawnbrokery on the day in question. Come to my chambers during the recess.Gregson: Yes, sir, My Lord.Judge: Very well... Court is adjourned until 1:40 p.m.!To be continued...17th April, 12:41 p.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberRyunosuke: Ah, Gina. How are you holding up?Gina: .........Ryunosuke: (I'm starting to feel quite warmly towards her frequent cold shoulders now.)Iris: Ginny! Are you alright? Why aren't you saying anything?Gina: ......... Wot's the point, eh? Why go to all this trouble an' fight so 'ard...for the likes o' me?Iris: What?Gina: Well you saw it! That picture.Ryunosuke: What picture?Iris: Ah, you mean this? The photograph taken by Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder. Well, I didn't think it would have captured a scene like this, that's for sure!Gina: It's 'opeless. Anyone who sees that's gonna think I did it, ain't they?Ryunosuke: Well...I won't pretend it wasn't a bit of a shock when the prosecution first presented it to the court.Gina: Surely you've gotta 'ave yer doubts about me now. Ya can't still think I'm innocent.Ryunosuke: ......... Of course I can.Gina: Hmph.........Iris: Ginny...why don't you talk to us? Tell us what really happened that night.Gina: Eh?Iris: Runo's cleverly managed to piece together a lot of new information, but still... ...we'd really like to hear it from you.Gina: ......... Alright then. It was after we'd 'ad that dinner together at your place, right, Iris? Then we all 'ad a chat up in your office, didn't we?Ryunosuke: Yes, I remember.Gina: After that, I just couldn't get to sleep. So I slipped out an' went down the street to the two-to-one. To Windibank's place. ...I 'ad to know.Ryunosuke: If Iris's story was there or not? 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.Gina: I dunno wot it's about or nuffin'... ...but if you ask me, there's somefin' in it that Sholmes don't like. Somefin' wot 'e don't want people readin'. So that's why 'e lied to Iris about stickin' it in lug wiv Windibank for safekeepin'. At least, that's wot I thought at the time.Ryunosuke: So you broke into Windibank's?Gina: I just 'ad to know if it was there or not. I mean, I 'ad no idea all o' that was gonna kick off, did I? I struck the lock and snuck inside. It was dark as you like in there. So I gave the oil lamp on the counter a bit o' wick. And that's when...What d'you think you're doing?!AAAAAAGH!Gina: I nearly died, I did! And the next thing I knew... ...I'd grabbed the gun off the counter and was wavin' it in the air like...I dunno wot.Ah...you're the girl who was in here this afternoon. I didn't think pickpockets went in for armed robbery.The, the mantelscript... 'Ave you got it 'ere? Did Sholmes leave a load o' papers wiv you? A story.Windibank:I beg your pardon?Gina:'The Hound o' the...' somefin'-or-other. If it's 'ere, I wanna see it!Windibank:I'm sorry, young lady... ...but I'd sooner die than relinquish an article belonging to one of my customers.Gina:I don't want it! Wot would I do wiv it anyway? I just...wanna see it's 'ere, that's all.Windibank:Oh, you want to see it, do you?Gina:I wanna know if Sholmes really pawned it 'ere or not. Please! Just let me see it an' I'll go.Windibank:......... Oh, very well then. But for pity's sake, stop waving my gun around, would you?Gina: So then the old cove unlocked the storeroom door, and we both went inside. And it was there alright. The mantelscript. Sholmes weren't lyin' after all.Iris: You did all that just to check for me, Ginny?Gina: ...Anyway, then there was a bit of a kick-up out in the main bit o' the shop.Ryunosuke: The Skulkin brothers arriving on the scene, yes.Gina:Wot was that noise? Someone's breakin' in!Windibank:Dear me, is there some burglars' convention here tonight that I don't know about?Gina:...I think I forgot to shut the door be'ind me. Sorry.Windibank:I'd better go and take care of it. Could I possibly have my gun back?Gina:Oh, well I'll come wiv ya and-Windibank:Now don't be foolish, young girl. You must stay right here. Don't leave this room under any circumstances.Gina: An' wiv that, 'e took the gun out of me 'ands and walked back out into the shop. I 'ung back in the storeroom like 'e said, strainin' me ears in the dark to 'ear wot was goin' on. It sounded like they got into a bit of a scrap. I started to think I should 'elp, see. So I was just about to go out the storeroom myself, when...*BANG!**BANG!*Gina: I 'eard a couple o' shots go off. Two, I think. Almost at the same time. And then there 'e was, right at me feet. Lyin' face down on the floor! I was right next to the storeroom door, so I slammed it shut an' locked it quick as ya like.Ryunosuke: Because you thought whoever had shot Mr Windibank might come for you?Gina: Yeah. So I went to grab the old cove's gun. I figured I'd put up a fight at least. But when I got a better look at 'im, I knew... ...Windibank was a goner. I felt funny in me 'ead all of a sudden. Kind of dizzy. And after that...I don't remember nuffin'.Ryunosuke: That must be when you passed out, Gina.Gina: ......... If...if I 'adn't done wot I done... ...the old cove might still be alive!Ryunosuke: Did you tell the police everything you just told us?Gina: 'Course I did! But they didn't believe a word of it, did they? All they said was, if I kept tellin' lies, it'd make things even worse for me. .........Iris: It'll be alright, Ginny, don't worry. Just stay strong a little longer. Runo's about to put the real culprit through the mill!Gina: ......... That cove wot was there in the afternoon? That Eggert Benedict...I still remember 'ow 'e looked at me. Like I was nuffin'. 'E...'e was there that night.Ryunosuke: We don't know his real name yet... ...but I'm convinced that he's involved somehow.Gina: .........Ryunosuke: Anyway, thank you for telling us what happened, Gina. I appreciate your honesty.Gina: You wot?Iris: You can leave it all in Runo's capable hands now, Ginny!Gina: ......... Mr Narra-'Oddo...Ryunosuke: Yes?Gina: ...'Ow come you trust me? I don't get it.Ryunosuke: .........Gina: I mean, 'ave you forgotten wot 'appened 'ere before? Come on, it was only two months ago. Me and McGilded...we told you a whole pack o' lies. An' you got the bogtrotter off wiv 'em! Even though 'e was a killer!Ryunosuke: ......... No, I could never forget that.Gina: Oh...Ryunosuke: (I did what I thought was best at the time. But the pain of that error of judgement doesn't get any easier to bear.) Still, don't forget that I also made you a promise. I told you that I'd be on your side to the bitter end, no matter what.Gina: But wot if I'm lyin'?! You could be workin' to get another killer off the 'ook for all you know!Ryunosuke: ......... I was once in your position, Gina. I was the accused in a trial.Gina: You were?Ryunosuke: Before I left Japan. I was accused of murder. And strange as it might sound, the circumstances of the crime were pretty damning. I was sure that no one would believe it wasn't me who'd done it.Iris: Oh, Runo...Ryunosuke: But there was one person who stood up for me. Who believed in me, and was prepared to defend me. My best friend.Ryunosuke, no one believes in you more than I do. Leave this to me. All you need to do is put your faith in me, and I'll do the rest!Ryunosuke: I was so happy, I cried. But even then... ...somewhere inside me, I couldn't help thinking: 'Surely he doesn't really believe in me. Not completely.'Gina: ...!Ryunosuke: But...I was wrong.As soon as my trial began, it was obvious... ...that he had an absolute, unwavering belief in me. And in turn, I developed an absolute, unwavering belief in him.Ryunosuke: Since then, I came to realise... ...if you want someone to believe in you, you have to believe in the other person first.Gina: Wot are you sayin'...?Ryunosuke: I promise you, Gina, that no matter what happens, I'll keep believing in you. So you don't need to worry. I won't let you down.Gina: ......... Even though I'm a diver? ...And a no-good liar?Ryunosuke: ......... You're not like McGilded. I know that.Gina: Eh?Iris: That's right! You're our friend, Ginny!Gina: I-Iris!Ryunosuke: We know you better than you think. And we've come to the conclusion that you're someone we can trust.Iris: Yes!Ryunosuke: That's really all we need to know.Iris: Exactly!Gina: Um...Mr Narra-'Oddo, I, um... I... *Sniffle, sniffle*Bailiff: Defendant Gina Lestrade and her legal representative! Court proceedings are about to resume. Please head into the courtroom immediately!Ryunosuke: Yes, of course! Thank you.I'd been both a defendant and a defending lawyer in my time. So I knew only too well... ...just how hard it was to put all your faith in another. And I also knew... ...just how hard it was to bear the burden of another putting all their faith in you. (This is it at last. The final chapter. The final battle. Wish me luck, Susato-san... And I hope you're watching over me too...partner!)17th April, 1:41 p.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: I hereby call this court to order as we resume the trial of Miss Gina Lestrade. Lord van Zieks, have you successfully subpoenaed the witness?Van Zieks: The subpoena was delivered to the communication station where the man works immediately, My Lord. However, the heavy rain has delayed the arrival of his carriage, it would seem.Judge: Hm, I see. Then let us turn our attention to Inspector Gregson's precis of the case heard by the court this morning. The glaring omission of the third bullet in your report is a serious blunder, Inspector.Gregson: Yes, um, I can only apologise, My Lord.Judge: And although the defence's chemical analysis of the blood at the scene makes for a compelling argument... ...I cannot permit such untried methods to be used as evidence in my courtroom.Iris: Hmph! It's a big mistake to cross Hurley and me. A very big mistake!Bailiff: My Lord! The subpoenaed witness has just arrived in the building.Judge: Thank you, Officer. Show him to the stand without delay.Ryunosuke: (Mr Eggert Benedict... I didn't expect to be crossing paths with him again so soon. And certainly not like this.)Judge: Thank you for complying with the court's subpoena at such short notice, sir.???: But of course, My Lord. As an upstanding member of London society, it is my pleasure to oblige.Judge: Now, kindly state your name and occupation for the record.Graydon: Ashley Graydon, communications officer.Juror No. 5: Mr Graydon and I both work at London's central communication station.Graydon: Now perhaps somebody would kindly explain what all this is about?Van Zieks: You were apprised of the situation by the court officer on your way here, I presume.Graydon: Yes, I was. Something to do with a murder that took place at a pawnbroker's on Baker Street. And some nonsense about me having been there on the night in question.Van Zieks: That is the accusation, indeed.Graydon: This really is beyond a joke, you know.Judge: Very well. Without further delay, the court will hear your testimony now, Mr Graydon. You will respond to the accusation made against you under oath.Graydon: Gladly, My Lord. Gladly.Witness Testimony - The Accusation -Graydon: Naturally, I have occasion to make use of pawnbroking services from time to time. But are you seriously suggesting I colluded with these thugs to break into the place on the night of the murder? ...I have no intention of admitting to such an outrageous accusation. Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene. Some scaramouch detective's homebrewed tincture can hardly be taken as serious evidence.Judge: So...you deny the accusation completely, do you?Graydon: I must say, I am dismayed. For the highest court in the land to be swayed by this self-professed detective's toy...Van Zieks: It was the will of the jury. And our great British justice system demands that the jury's will is upheld.Graydon: Then it would seem we have the misfortune of a most inept assembly of jurors today.Juror No. 1: ...! By golly!Graydon: How long am I expected to be detained here?Judge: If, following the defence's cross-examination, your involvement in this matter has not been established... ...you will be free to leave immediately.Graydon: Good. Then I shall be away in time for afternoon tea. Some small consolation at least.Judge: Let us not hold up Mr Graydon any longer than necessary, Counsel. Proceed with the cross-examination.Ryunosuke: So...we meet again, Mr Eggert Benedict. Or is it Mr Graydon?Graydon: ......... My apologies. You are...?Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke Naruhodo, defence lawyer. We have met.Graydon: If you say so. Ashley Graydon. Enchanté. So...Ryunosuke: Agh!Graydon: ...I trust we can conclude this quickly.Ryunosuke: Ugh... (But I'm NOT holding your flashy hat while we do.)Cross-Examination - The Accusation -Graydon: Naturally, I have occasion to make use of pawnbroking services from time to time.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Yes, we even met in the very pawnbrokery where the crime took place on the afternoon of the day in question. Though of course...you introduced yourself by a different name at the time. Graydon: ...! Ryunosuke: It was Mr Eggert Benedict, I believe. Tell me, what made you- Van Zieks: Van Zieks: The witness is here to testify about events that took place that night. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: He is under no obligation to answer such unrelated questions. Ryunosuke: You can't be serious! Graydon: ...Thank you. Because I certainly do not feel inclined to answer such an inappropriate question. Ryunosuke: (So he's going to be evasive, is he? In an effort not to give anything away. This could be tricky...) Graydon: .........Graydon: But are you seriously suggesting I colluded with these thugs to break into the place on the night of the murder?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Have you seen these two men before? Graydon: This pair? ...No. I don't associate with criminals. Ryunosuke: (Said by a man who introduced himself as 'Eggert Benedict'...) Graydon: I'd like to know who I have to thank for this. Who made this outlandish accusation against me? Van Zieks: The young lawyer there in the black. Graydon: This is a farce! Whose idea was it to permit an outsider to work in a British court anyway? Ryunosuke: ...! Graydon: Well, needless to say...Graydon: ...I have no intention of admitting to such an outrageous accusation.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Where were you at around one in the morning on the night in question, sir? Graydon: That is past the hour at which I would normally retire. Certainly... ...I was not in the company of these rapscallions. Ryunosuke: You're able to prove that? Graydon: ......... Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Listen carefully, my learned Nipponese friend... ...for you appear to be under a gross misapprehension on this point. Ryunosuke: What do you mean? Van Zieks: The witness maintains he was not at the scene of the crime. He has no obligation to prove his absence. If your accusation is that the witness was present at the scene... ...the obligation lies with you to prove your assertion. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: You will fulfil that obligation before putting any more unreasonable questions to the witness. Ryunosuke: (A silent victory wiggle. Thanks.)Graydon: Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Blood was found at the scene of the crime. There's no question of that. Mr Sholmes's chemical analysis has positively identified the substance as such. Graydon: But I am not the only human to have blood running through my veins, am I? How can you be sure that the blood is mine? It could equally be the blood of one of these two miscreants. Ryunosuke: Every individual's blood has a slightly different composition, it seems. Mr Sholmes's chemical is able to differentiate different blood samples by- Graydon: Spare me the science lesson! ...Who is this Sholmes character anyway? Ryunosuke: Oh. I, I assumed all Londoners would know the name. He's a grea- Well, a renowned detective. Van Zieks: So, even you are unable to bring yourself to say 'great detective'. Graydon: A great detective, you say? Tsk! Now we're in the realm of fairy tales, are we? The counsel for the defence thinks a British courtroom is an appropriate place for fairy tales, does he? Pursue Nash Skulkin Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to say about that, Mr Skulkin? Ringo: Eh? Wot? Me? Ryunosuke: ...No, the Mr Skulkin next to you. Gregson: Right, I've had it up to here with this! How many times have I gotta tell you? Ryunosuke: Yes, I know. You're not 'Big Bruv Sulky'. Mr Nash Skulkin! Nash: Eh? Cor blimey, guvnor! You wot?! Ryunosuke: Is it not the case that when Mr Graydon just spoke, a thought went through your mind? Would you care to share that thought with the court? Nash: Eh? Me thoughts? I dun 'ave none o' them! It must've been 'im! Ringo: You wot?! Ryunosuke: Mr Nash Skulkin! ...Answer the question, please. What went through your mind when Mr Graydon just spoke? Nash: Nuffin'! Honest, guv! Nuffin'! I, I woz just thinkin'... ...if 'e waves 'is arm around like that much more, it'll open up the wound again, that's all! Ryunosuke: What wound? Nash: Where 'e took the bullet, o' course! It woz only two days ago. It ain't gonna be 'ealed up yet! So I woz, um... Well, ya know... I woz worryin' for 'im, and... ......... Oh, 'ell's bells! Ryunosuke: Mr Graydon! Did you hear that? Graydon: What? Ryunosuke: Your comrade is worried about you, it seems. ...On account of your injured arm. Graydon: ......... My Lord. Judge: Yes, Mr Graydon? Graydon: I have no idea what these two wretches are talking about. Certainly, I shouldn't be expected to answer anything in relation to their mindless insinuations. Judge: Hmmm... Ryunosuke: We know that someone other than the victim was hit by a bullet at the scene of the crime two nights ago. And from the height of the bullet hole in the wall, that person was likely hit in the upper arm or thereabouts. Graydon: ......... Ryunosuke: Perhaps you'd allow a court official to examine your arm, sir? The left arm that you're currently clasping with your right hand, as if in pain! Graydon: ......... No. ...I refuse. Ryunosuke: ...! Graydon: You have shown no evidence whatsoever that links me to these common thieves. Accordingly, I am not obliged to permit any such invasion of my privacy! As I've already said, I'm completely uninvolved in all this. I've never had anything to do with the pawnbrokery where this fellow was killed whatsoever! I take offence at the insinuation that I was in any way involved! Judge: Hm...you claim to have had nothing whatsoever to do with Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery? Ryunosuke: My Lord! The defence would like that last statement to be added to Mr Graydon's formal testimony. Judge: Very well, Counsel. Continue with your testimony, My Graydon. Graydon: ......... Removes statement \"Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene.\" Adds statement \"The bottom line is, I've never had anything to do with the pawnbroking establishment where the man was killed!\" Ryunosuke: Ugh... Iris: Argh! This is so unfair! That chemical test is based on solid science! Hurley and I know what we're doing! Ryunosuke: The trouble is, unless the technique can be independently verified... ...we'll never get beyond this man's flashy stick-waving. Graydon: Granted, it is a very colourful alchemy. Perhaps it would make a good souvenir for your uneducated friends back home in the East. Ryunosuke: (Something riled him there. Just for a moment, Mr Graydon let his feathers get ruffled...) Graydon: But a souvenir is all it's good for.Graydon: Some scaramouch detective's homebrewed tincture can hardly be taken as serious evidence.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Don't forget, sir, that Mr Herlock Sholmes is the most famous detective in the world. Graydon: And the most famous detective in the world tells the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, hm? Ryunosuke: Erm, well, um... (Oh no! I can't think how to answer that!) Van Zieks: I once saw the world's most famous swindler thrown into jail. He allegedly told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but...what turned out to be a pack of lies. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Graydon: Quite. Now... ...as you are no doubt aware, the central communication station is the heart of this country's information network. My work there is of paramount importance. And you have kept me from it for long enough already.Graydon: The bottom line is, I've never had anything to do with the pawnbroking establishment where the man was killed!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Never had anything to do with it? You forget that I was there, Mr Graydon! On the very afternoon of the incident! Graydon: ...Obviously, I am not a complete stranger to the pawnbroker's. I'm currently on the lookout for an armchair to furnish my study. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: No! You were there to redeem an article! Graydon: I have no idea what you're talking about. Pursue Tobias Gregson Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to add, Inspector? Gregson: Eh? Come again, sunshine? Ryunosuke: You were there, too, in fact, weren't you, Inspector? That afternoon. Gregson: ......... Well yes, I do remember meetin' yourself in the pawnbroker's that afternoon. You, your young Japanese assistant, and the accused were all present, as I recall. Ryunosuke: And at that time, this witness, Mr Graydon, was trying to acquire a particular article... Gregson: Um...well now... Ryunosuke: ...! Gregson: I'm afraid I don't remember too clearly. Ryunosuke: What?! But, but you must! Gregson: I'm not going to lie and pretend I remember somethin' that I don't. Ryunosuke: ...! (What's going on here?) Iris: Gregsy showed us a picture before, didn't he? You know, from the cameras that Hurley installed in Windibank's. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, of course. Judge: Indeed. And the gentleman pictured bears a striking resemblance to the witness, I must say. Ryunosuke: Exactly! Which proves that Mr Graydon was in the shop on the afternoon in question! Graydon: At no point have I denied that fact. Ryunosuke: ...! Graydon: I merely entered the shop to peruse the articles on sale and have a word with the broker. Nothing more. Gregson: ......... Ryunosuke: (This makes no sense. I understand why Mr Graydon might be trying to cover his tracks... ...but why would Gregson be trying to avoid giving testimony about what happened?) Leads back to cross-examination Ryunosuke: Sorry? Graydon: You must be confusing me with somebody else. I wasn't there for any such purpose. Ryunosuke: But, but the redemption article! Iris: That won't get you anywhere, Runo. Ryunosuke: Iris! ...What do you mean? Iris: Mr Windibank never wrote the names of his customers on his redemption tickets. So you can't prove the ticket was his. Ryunosuke: Ah! (Of course... She's right.) Iris: I'm afraid... ...you're going to need to produce some irrefutable evidence here. Otherwise he'll never admit to being there. Ryunosuke: Hm...irrefutable evidence...Present Music Box Disk Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Have you ever seen this disk before, Mr Graydon?\"Before correctly pursuing Nash Skulkin Ryunosuke: (That's all he's going to say on the matter, is it?) Iris: What do you think, Runo? Ryunosuke: I think he has no intention of telling us anything. He's well aware that the less he says, the less chance he has of giving himself away. Iris: Hm... The complete opposite of Hurley, then. He seems to think that the more he says, the better. Ryunosuke: I need to find a way of getting more information out of this man somehow... (But compared to the bungling burglars beside him, he seems as innocent as a child.) Iris: Or perhaps the Skulkin brothers might be the key here? Ryunosuke: Oh... (Could they be somehow...?) Iris: Remember, if you don't prove this witness has some connection to the incident here, he'll be free to leave. Ryunosuke: I know. I can't let that happen. (Let's listen to those statements again and see if there's any way I can make one of them tell us more.)After correctly pursuing Nash Skulkin Ryunosuke: (That's all he's going to say on the matter, is it?) Iris: What do you think, Runo? Ryunosuke: I think he has no intention of telling us anything. He's well aware that the less he says, the less chance he has of giving himself away. Iris: Hm... The complete opposite of Hurley, then. He seems to think that the more he says, the better. Ryunosuke: Well, at least I managed to prise a little more information from these witnesses' lips. All thanks to the Skulkin brothers... Iris: Yes! They were the key to it after all! Ryunosuke: So he says he had nothing to do with Windibank's... (Well, we know that's not true.) Iris: Perhaps now would be a good time to have a proper look through the Court Record. Ryunosuke: Good idea. You never know what tiny scrap of information could become a valuable weapon...Ryunosuke: Have you ever seen this disk before, Mr Graydon?Graydon: ......... Why? Is it supposed to mean something?Ryunosuke: This disk was, until the day of his murder, in pawn in Mr Windibank's shop. It was redeemed by the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade that afternoon. However... ...somebody mysteriously appeared to try to take it from her. And that somebody was you, of course. Wasn't it, Mr Graydon?Graydon: As I have reiterated numerous times now...you are mistaken. That was not me. I've never seen that disk before in my life.Ryunosuke: It may have escaped your notice, but there is a small smear of blood on the disk.Judge: Ah yes. Resulting from an abrasion of the thumb, perhaps?Ryunosuke: That's right. The surface of the disk is covered in hundreds of tiny metal bumps. In the skirmish to acquire the disk, the thumb of the person who tried to take it suffered minor lacerations.Graydon: ...!Ryunosuke: So! While the disk bears the remnants of that skirmish in the form of this smear of blood... ...the thumb of the person in question must bear the remnants also. In the form of a scratch!Judge: Good gracious! Indeed it must!Ryunosuke: Mr Graydon!Graydon: ...!Ryunosuke: You refused to allow a court officer to examine your arm before. Are you now going to refuse to allow us to examine your thumb? Because I have no doubt that it bears a small scratch consistent with the smear of blood on this disk!Graydon: ...! ......... Well well... ...it would seem I underestimated you.Judge: What, what is the meaning of this?Ryunosuke: So you admit it now? You admit you have a scratch on your thumb from when you attempted to take the disk from the defendant?!Judge: Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! ...Well, Mr Graydon?Graydon: ...It would appear there has been something of a misunderstanding here. I did not attempt to take the disk, as you put it. No, quite the reverse.Ryunosuke: What are you trying to say?Graydon: It's really quite simple, you see. The disk was mine from the outset. Is there some crime in taking an item that you own out of pawn?Ryunosuke: What?!Van Zieks: It would seem, Mr Graydon... ...that in this piece of evidence, my learned friend has established a link between yourself and the incident. Accordingly...you will tell the court everything you know about this disk now.Graydon: ...As you wish. Though I'm quite sure it has nothing whatsoever to do with the pawnbroker's murder.Witness Testimony - The Disk -Graydon: There's a note on the disk saying, 'For McGilded', but the item belongs to me. The redemption ticket was stolen from me by the accused - that filthy gutterling - on the day in question. I proceeded at once to the shop in order to explain my situation and redeem my article. In the end, of course, the disk was taken by the police. In other words...I had absolutely no reason to break into the shop later that same night.Judge: Did I hear you correctly, sir? 'McGilded', you say? The famous London philanthropist? Who perished in this very courtroom two months ago after being acquitted of a distinctly messy murder?Graydon: Yes, My Lord. The one and the same.Judge: Good Lord! Mr Graydon! Are you saying that Mr McGilded and yourself were acquainted?Graydon: ......... Yes. That's correct.Judge: Ordaaar! ...Well. I certainly didn't expect to hear that name uttered here in my courtroom again.Ryunosuke: (According to what Gina told us, this disk was placed in pawn on that fateful night two months ago. McGilded himself gave instructions to deposit it at Windibank's.)Iris: It's funny that Mr Graydon here is claiming the disk belongs to him then, isn't it?Ryunosuke: In all likelihood, he's lying. (So he appeared that afternoon at Windibank's in order to get his hands on McGilded's disk for some reason...)Judge: Counsel, you will commence your cross-examination, please.Cross-Examination - The Disk -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

    "cot": "The evidence \"White Cat Photograph #2 → Pawnbroker's Ticket (Coat)\" (evidence 4) indicates that the redemption ticket was pawned at Windibank's pawnbrokery and has a blood stain identified as Mr Mason's blood, which was given to Gina Lestrade. This supports the fact that the accused, Gina Lestrade, physically possessed the pawn ticket.\n\nHowever, the testimony 1 from Graydon states: \"The redemption ticket was stolen from me by the accused - that filthy gutterling - on the day in question.\" This implies that Graydon claims the accused stole the ticket from him, meaning he had possession first and she took it unlawfully.\n\nThese two conflict since the evidence shows the ticket was redeemed by Gina (accused) but the testimony shows Graydon claiming that the ticket was stolen by Gina. The crux is the disagreement over possession and legitimacy of the ticket.\n",

Sholmes' cry pierced through the thick wall of fog around us. Wisps of vapour flowed over the pistol as I cocked it, and I waited breathlessly in the stillness. The silence lasted for what seemed an eternity until, at last, it appeared. From the shadows of the cloud, an enormous beast sprang out upon us. A hound it was, but not such a hound as any mortal has ever seen. Its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, the whole of its ox-sized body was outlined in white-hot flames. Its rumbling pant and hideous howl... So terrified was I that I began to tremble with fear. 'Look well, Wilson!' Sholmes declared, gazing upon the mystical beast. 'For this! This is the diabolical Hound of the Baskervilles!' Our first two months in London passed by in a flash. In that disconcerting courtroom experience we were first thrown into on the day we arrived in the country... ...and in Soseki-san's terrible ordeal that had followed closely behind, we had emerged victorious. However... ...there then came an abrupt end to our opportunities to appear in court. Which was hardly surprising, of course... ...since I was nothing more than an amateur, an unknown student of law from a faraway land. So life in our little office was very quiet. That is... ...until it was shattered one day, by that fateful telegram... 15th April, 9:13 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy *Knock knock knock* That morning... ...I was woken by the unreserved knocking on the door by the telegram boy. But after he'd gone... ...Susato-san's behaviour became very obviously strange. Ryunosuke: Um...Susato-san? Susato: Yes! Is it time to leave for court already? Let me see... What case is it today? Ryunosuke: I...don't think I'm scheduled to defend anyone at the moment, am I? Susato: Oh! No, of course not. How silly of me. Ryunosuke: But I think Iris said she would make us breakfast this morning. So shall we go down to Mr Sholmes's suite? Susato: Yes! Iris makes the most delicious breakfast food. Ryunosuke: She does, doesn't she? Susato: And once our bellies are full, we can leave for court in fighting fit form! Let me see... What case is it today? Ryunosuke: (Here we go again...) 15th April Sholmes's Suite Iris: Morning, Runo! Morning, Susie! Susato: Good morning, Iris! Ryunosuke: Um...Iris... Iris: What is it, Runo? Ryunosuke: What is that terrible noise? It sounds like a cat being strangled. Iris: Ah, yes... You noticed that, did you? Hurley isn't in the best form this morning, it seems. Sholmes: Hello... Susato: Hello...Mr Sholmes. Ryunosuke: G-Good morning. Sholmes: ......... A good morning to die perhaps... Ryunosuke: ...Has something happened, Mr Sholmes? You look miserable, and...the way you were playing the violin before... Sholmes: Hmph. My analytical mind is dead. Music is dead. The world...is dead. Damn this blanched existence! ...That's all it is, my dear fellow. Nothing of consequence. Susato: I'm afraid I don't understand. Sholmes: Well, Iris? Isn't it time we ate? Some dry toast and insipid coffee for me...if it's not too much trouble. ???: Miaow... Ryunosuke: Oh look, it's Wagahai. Susato: Good morning, boy. Wagahai: Miaow. Ryunosuke: ......... (That must be some sort of tiny door for cats to use. But how did it get there?) Iris: Well then, everyone, time for breakfast! Susato: Oh, wonderful! Let me help you, Iris.

Sholmes: What was that? Iris: Oh no! Wagahai's tangled up in your violin! Susato: I think he thinks it's a toy! Ryunosuke: No! (What's he doing to it?!) Susato: Oh dear... Mr Sholmes's precious violin... Sholes: ...Why should I care? Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: I shouldn't be surprised... ...if the cat is a more accomplished musician than I now. Susato: ...Mr Sholmes really is in poor spirits, isn't he? Iris: Well anyway, I'll put it back where it lives, shall I, Hurley? Ryunosuke: Out of the cat's reach, if possible.

Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: Crunching your toast with that vacant aspect... Fressing your coffee so obtusely... Are you not a little embarrassed by your own conduct, considering the urgency with which we are faced? Susato: We must visit Mr Windibank's brokery at once! That's right, isn't it, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Precisely, Miss Susato. Without a moment's delay! Ryunosuke: But, but I haven't finished my bacon and eggs... Sholmes: My dear fellow!

There are all sorts of tools and contraptions in here that I've never laid eyes on before! Ryunosuke: (Ah, Susato-san...and that spark of wonder in your eyes. You can't wait to scour the shelves, can you?) I get the impression you enjoy places like this? Susato: Oh yes! I don't know why, but seeing such a lot of things I don't understand is a real thrill for me! Sholmes: My dear fellows...let us not forget why we are here. Susato: Oh! Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: We are calling on matters of business, not pleasure. Ryunosuke: (And clearly Mr Sholmes means business, too, judging from the spark of fury in HIS eyes.) Windibank: Ah, Mr Sholmes, sir! Welcome back! Sholmes: ...Did you hear that brazen welcome? Ryunosuke: Well, yes. We are potential customers, after all. Sholmes: We are disgruntled customers, Mr Naruhodo. And it's time to inform Mr Windibank of our ire. Come! The fight is afoot! After clearing all Converse options: Windibank: Now then, Mr Sholmes, allow me to return your precious violin. Sholmes: Ah, the very thing! Thank you, Mr Windibank. Windibank: Perhaps this might mark the end of the peculiar items you try to pop, hm? Because if anything were to happen to one of them... ...this would be the only answer! Ryunosuke: Um, I really think you ought to stop waving that gun around. Someone could get hurt. Windibank: Fear not! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Windibank: I've only loaded a single bullet, so no one but myself could possibly be harmed! Ryunosuke: (That's...not really what I meant.) Sholmes: Good day to you then, Mr Windibank. Windibank: It's been a pleasure as always, Mr Sholmes! Susato: So, Mr Naruhodo! Now we can explore at last!

She's a chancer. Earns her crust among large crowds, relievin' people of their purses. What's commonly called a pickpocket. Gina: ......... Gordon Bennett! You lot! Susato: Hello, Miss Lestrade. I hope you've been well. Gina: Eh?! Wot, you remember me then, do ya? Ryunosuke: Well, I remember being completely surrounded by smoke, that's for sure. Gina: So...wot are you doin' in 'ere? Down and out, like the rest of us? Nuffin' to eat? Come to pop that black weasel - sorry, 'coat' - 'ave ya? Ryunosuke: (...What is it about this black uniform that makes everyone comment on it?) Sholmes: Ah, good day. Unless I'm much mistaken... ...you would be the young pickpocket who stole our experimental smoke grenade launcher. Gina: Agh! Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: So...you have something of value to pawn, do you? Allow me to see the article, and I shall negotiate with Mr Windibank on your behalf. Gina: Pull the other one! I don't need no 'elp from some stuck-up dee! Get outta my business! Go on, or I'll make trouble for ya! Sholmes: As you wish, Miss Lestrade. I will happily remove myself from your presence. Ryunosuke: (He's really done it. He's gone.) Windibank: I'm sorry, but as I said, there really is no room for negotiation here. Ryunosuke: (What is that thing he has in his hand? Some kind of metal disk?) Gina: And you! Go on! Leave me alone! Susato: Oh, Miss Lestrade, just pretend we aren't here. We shan't be offended in the slightest. Gina: ......... Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: (Susato-san can really stand her ground when she wants to.) Gina: Wotever... After clearing \"Gina Lestrade\" and \"New article to pawn\" Converse options with Pop Windibank: ???: Out of my way, please! Ryunosuke: (Who's this picture-postcard English gentleman?) ???: Good day to you, ladies. Gentlemen. Gina: Wot's your problem, eh? ???: There is no problem, as long as you remove yourself. I've a matter to discuss with the proprietor. Gina: ...! ???: And if you intend to make a problem of it, I shall see you outside, little girl, for the hiding you deserve. Gina: Look, ain't it obvious? I ain't done talkin' wiv 'im yet. If you think yer such a gent, you should know 'ow to wait in line. ???: ......... Well, you are an impudent little brat, aren't you? ...As well as a pickpocket. Gina: Eh? Who, who are you? 'Ow d'you know who I am? ???: The question is, how do YOU not know who I am? You haven't the courtesy even to remember the faces of your victims, it seems. Gina: ...! Wot?! You mean I...? From you...? ???: Broker! Windibank: Um, yes, sir? ???: I believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemd an article from you, no? Windibank: Yes, yes, erm... ???: The article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once. Susato: Oh my! Gina: Now that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull? ???: Give me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box disks, too. Gina: No! You, you can't 'ave it! You just can't! It's me old man's! Or it was! ...Now it's mine! Susato: Goodness, Mr Naruhodo... ...this is a very awkward situation. Ryunosuke: Yes... I think perhaps we should hear both sides of the story in a little more detail. After clearing all Converse options with Gina Lestrade and \"Eggert Benedict\": Windibank: So, let that be an end to the matter. And thank you for your custom, Mr Eggert Benedict, sir. Benedict: With such reasonable rates of interest...I may even decide to come back. Gina: ......... Tsk! This is why I 'ate grown-ups! Just cos I'm a diver, everyone thinks that makes me a liar. Benedict: And the contents of the coat pockets, if you please, broker. Windibank: But of course, sir. Here is the disk for you. Benedict: ......... Just this one? Windibank: Pardon, sir? Benedict: I was expecting another. Er, that is...I deposited another. Ryunosuke: (Another disk?) Windibank: Oh, um... Oh dear. I regret to inform you, sir, that what was deposited with me was merely the overcoat. The disk happened to be in one of the pockets, but I was completely unaware of it until now. Benedict: So, gutterling... You're hiding more of what's rightfully mine, are you? Gina: Says who, eh? I don't know nuffin' about it! Benedict: ......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style. Gina: Wait a minute! That disk... ...is mine! Benedict: Argh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal! Susato: Oh my! Yes! There's blood on the disk! Ryunosuke: (It's because of all those sharp little bumps! The man must have scratched his finger on them.) Gina: I found it first, alright! I mean! It belonged to me old man! So yer not 'avin' it! ...Oi, you! You take it! Ryunosuke: Me? Gina: If I 'ang onto it, they'll 'ave it off me again. So you keep 'old of it. Ryunosuke: Miss Lestrade, I... (Why is this disk so important to her?) The music box disc has been entered into the Court Record. Benedict: You there! In the black livery! Hand that disk to me at once, please. Gina: No! Don't! He's lyin'! Grown-ups are all liars! Ryunosuke: (Ugh... What do I do now? How am I going to resolve this?) Ryunosuke: Erm...Mr Sholmes... ...what are you examining with such keen interest there? As you enjoy a bar of caramel, I see. Sholmes: ......... So... ...you've found me at last...Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: After that young pickpocket sent me on my way, I was forced to lurk in the shadows. Cruelly ostracised, as the rest of you partook in the jovial atmosphere of fellowship. I had nothing to occupy my mind, but was too ashamed to let society see what my downfall had done to me. So feigning mock interest, I pretended to examine the tedious trinkets in this desolate place. ...Whilst, as you shrewdly observed, gnawing on the only friend I have left: this seven per cent solution of caramel. Pray, do you claim to understand the depths of my despair, Mr Naruhodo? But how could you?! I was so lonely... So desperately lonely... Ryunosuke: Then...why on earth didn't you rejoin the conversation? Things have gone from bad to worse here, you know! Sholmes: Yes...I overheard much of your conversation. Or rather...in my craving for human contact, my ears devoured every word that was uttered! Ryunosuke: ...You really were sad, weren't you? Susato: Poor Mr Sholmes. I feel simply awful for you. Sholmes: It would seem... ...that my inferences are correct. Susato: Oh! ...Surely you're not about to tell us... ...that you've solved the entire case once again?! Sholmes: My dear madam, sometimes I wonder... Were my genius for deduction to be commoditised... ...how much could I pawn it for? Ryunosuke: (It seems Mr Sholmes has had another of his flashes of inspiration. But who knows if it will help to resolve the situation between Miss Lestrade and the mysterious gentleman? What's the right thing to do here...?) Sholmes: Well, Miss Lestrade...it would appear you find yourself in something of a predicament. Gina: Tsk! Where the blue blazes 'ave you been, eh? Sholmes: Pardon? Gina: When a lady's in trouble, a true gent's s'posed to be there to 'elp. Straight away! Not an 'our later! Ryunosuke: (...Harsh.) Benedict: And who, pray tell, are you? Sholmes: ......... Mr Eggert Benedict... ...you have, in my eyes, a veritably encyclopaedic array of curiosities about your person. Nevertheless, there are two immovable conclusions I have drawn. Benedict: I beg your pardon? Sholmes: The first is this: The true reason for your visit to this pawnbrokery today is something you have not yet revealed. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: And the second is this: A considerable crime is in contemplation. One you will orchestrate, with intent to steal a vast sum of money. Well, Mr Benedict? What say you to my deductions? Benedict: How...! Ryunosuke: (He's turned as white as a hard-boiled egg!) Susato: It would seem that once again...Mr Sholmes has made a flawless deduction! Benedict: Just who do you think you are, sir? Sholmes: Ah yes, as I hoped... That is precisely the pained expression I was looking for. So...shall we begin? The time has come for yet another Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! The Great DeductionThe game is afoot! Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Sholmes: First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! The piece of paper in your hand is a 'staff wanted' advertisement from this very shop. Yet even the most unobservant would soon realise that a man of your appearance has no need of such employ. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction. Benedict: What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years! Sholmes: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. The end of any walking cane would be terminated with a metal ferrule to protect the wooden tip. And yet detailed analysis shows the wooden tip of this stick to be utterly bare. Therefore...there is only one conclusion: The rod that you hold in your hand, which appears to be a walking cane... ...is in fact no cane at all! Benedict: ...! Sholmes: You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong? Benedict: I... Well, I... Sholmes: And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear? Benedict: ......... Sholmes: Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. From the moment I saw it, my suspicions were aroused. 'What walking cane demands such a stout handle?' mused I. Benedict: ......... Sholmes: But of course, as I said, this is no walking cane. No, that rod... ...is the broken handle of a shovel! Benedict: Wha...? Are you insane?! Sholmes: And now, having determined this undeniable truth, the conclusion is clear. Your true motive for coming here... ...was to take employment at this establishment in order to excavate the ground beneath the premises! What a calculated crime you have conceived, sir. A wickedly calculated crime. Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery Topic 2 Great Crime Sholmes: Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning. Benedict: This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, intend to excavate the ground beneath this pawnbrokery with a broken shovel? What on earth do you propose I could expect to find there? Some long-forgotten treasure, I suppose? Save for such a fanciful theory, what possible reason could I have to do as you say? Sholmes: Oh, but there is ample reason... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped. Benedict: What? Sholmes: Let us consider what would motivate a man to infiltrate a shop such as this and covertly dig beneath its floor... The answer is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. This letter gives notice of public works to be carried out in the local area. And according to the enclosed plan of the upcoming sewerage works... ...beneath this shop runs a sewer that adjoins another, one that runs under the bank on the opposite side of the road. Benedict: This madness has entered the sewers now, has it?! Sholmes: By excavating the ground beneath our feet, you would gain access to the waterway... ...that flows in very close proximity to the great vault of the financial institution opposite. Benedict: What are you...? Sholmes: In summary, sir... ...you devised a master plan to pull off an elaborate bank robbery by dint of the underground tunnels! Benedict: M... Master plan?! Sholmes: Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... With what plunder did the thief hope to make off from the underground vault of the bank? Benedict: Are you quite serious? Sholmes: Having consulted with Scotland Yard some days ago, I happen to know the answer. But naturally, the answer is no secret to you, is it, Mr Benedict? Benedict: I have no idea what you're talking about! Sholmes: Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know. Benedict: A postcard of the Great Exhibition? I'm afraid you've quite lost me. Sholmes: Currently in the final stages of preparation, the Great Exhibition will soon be underway. And the government has provided extra funds to complete its centrepiece, the Crystal Tower. Funds that currently sit in the vault of the bank on the other side of this road! Benedict: Pardon? Sholmes: Yes, the considerable crime you have been contemplating... ...is the theft of that which sits in the vault of that bank, the special reserve funds for the Great Exhibition! ...Of course, that is top-secret police information. So keep it under your hat, please. Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this pawnbroking puzzle! Ryunosuke: Um...Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: Well, Mr Naruhodo? An impressively upbeat deduction for a detective racked with loneliness, would you not agree? Ryunosuke: Was it true what you said about the bank over the road and what it has in its vault? Sholmes: Indeed. Though few know of its existence. It is one of the government's most closely guarded secrets. Gregson told me, in the strictest confidence. Susato: But you just announced it to everyone here. Rather loudly, in fact. Sholmes: ...Ah. Ryunosuke: And if it's such a big secret... ...how would Mr Benedict have come to find out about it? Sholmes: There can be but one explanation for that. Clearly it is because the man is a criminal! Susato: But what if he didn't know anything about the money in the vault? If he is a criminal, as you said... ...then buying a brand new shovel is sure to be the first thing he does now that you've revealed the secret. Sholmes: ...Oh. Ryunosuke: Or if he doesn't... ...maybe Mr Windibank will. He already has plenty of shovels here, after all. Windibank: Oh my life! I assure you I'm not so unscrupulous! Sholmes: Hm, well... Hopefully this has taught you a valuable lesson. Sensitive information must be handled with the utmost of care. One can never be sure that someone privy to secrets won't disclose them. And once the word is out, it's out. Ryunosuke: ...Perhaps I'll think twice before confiding in you next time, Mr Sholmes. Sholmes: An excellent idea, Mr Naruhodo. An excellent idea. Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Susato: Well then, Mr Naruhodo, you know what to do, I'm sure. Ryunosuke: Yes. Let's listen to that great deduction again, and see if we can massage it into shape! Sholmes: Very well, then. Let us start once more from the beginning... ...of Herlock Sholmes's magnificent 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! Course CorrectionHold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery Sholmes: First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! Ryunosuke: So, by Mr Sholmes's reasoning... ...Mr Benedict came here in order to apply for a job so he could dig down through the floor. Susato: Yes. In an attempt to tunnel into the sewers to gain access to the money in the vault of the bank across the road. But...he wouldn't get very far with a broken shovel, would he? Ryunosuke: No. I think it's fair to say his motives lie elsewhere. The question is, where? What did bring Mr Benedict here at this particular point in time? Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! Susato: I still don't quite understand why this gentleman came to Mr Windibank's today. Ryunosuke: He might look like a smartly dressed man about town, but perhaps he's destitute really. I really think that's the only explanation! Susato: We must stop thinking along those lines, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Yes...I suppose you're right. Well in that case... ...perhaps there's something in this pawn shop that the man was looking for? Susato: Let's look closely and see if there's anything about his person that gives us a clue. Ryunosuke: Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the info about Miss Lestrade! Sholmes: Quite so, my dear fellow! It would appear that the writing and sketch on the reverse of the flyer... ...pertain to the pickpocket, Miss Lestrade, and to Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery here. Benedict: Ah! Ryunosuke: You originally told us... ...that you had merely given chase after Miss Lestrade stole the redemption ticket from you. Sholmes: But that, sir, is a thinly veiled lie. Ryunosuke: It is the information on the back of the flyer that led you here today. By which I mean... Here, to Windibank's Pawnbrokery, and today, the redemption deadline of that overcoat. Sholmes: So you waited outside for the young girl matching the description you have written down to arrive. Benedict: Hmph! Sholmes: And you have gone to some lengths to hide the reason for your pursuit of Miss Lestrade. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction. Benedict: What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years! Sholmes: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. Ryunosuke: Um...what's a ferrule? Susato: It's the metal cap commonly found on the end of a cane, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Ah, the bit that makes the nice clacking sound on the pavement? Susato: Yes, exactly, And Mr Sholmes is right, it appears to be missing on this cane. Ryunosuke: ...But it doesn't actually look broken, does it? Susato: No, it doesn't. Though the gentleman certainly did recoil when Mr Sholmes identified the cane as suspicious. Ryunosuke: In other words... ...there's some secret about the cane that Mr Benedict would rather we don't know! The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. Ryunosuke: I don't know, I just can't picture it. I mean, a respectable gentleman strolling the streets of London with a shovel in his hand? (I'm sure it's just that the cane is broken and the ferrule was lost somehow.) Susato: Well, there is one thing of which we can be certain in all of this. After all, we saw it with our own eyes. At the mention of his cane, Mr Benedict visibly recoiled. Ryunosuke: ...! (That's very true. So there's definitely something about this cane that's not right...) Ryunosuke: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the initialling. Sholmes: A most astute observation...wouldn't you say, Mr Eggert Benedict? Benedict: ...! Sholmes: We are led to believe, sir, that your initials are 'E. B.'. Yet in a most possessive manner, you have in your grasp a cane bearing the initials 'A. G.'. An incontrovertible contradiction indeed, would you not agree? Benedict: No! You're, you're wrong. This cane isn't- Ryunosuke: You said before that you'd had that cane for years. Benedict: Grrr... Ryunosuke: So don't try to tell us that you just borrowed it from a friend or found it in the park! Sholmes: In short... ...though you hold yourself to be a gentleman, you have withheld your true name! Benedict: ...! Sholmes: You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong? Benedict: I... Well, I... Sholmes: And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear? Benedict: ......... Sholmes: Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Ryunosuke: Let's consider the bare bones of what's happened here: Miss Lestrade redeemed that fine-looking overcoat. And now a mysterious man has appeared, introducing himself with a fake name... ...and claiming that the overcoat belongs to him. Susato: But we know that he actually identified Miss Lestrade from a written description. Which suggests that everything else he's told us is untrue. Ryunosuke: So what we need to do here... ...is somehow prove that the overcoat cannot possibly belong to him! The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Ryunosuke: The man is white all over, but for his overcoat. That's almost reason enough to say it doesn't belong to him, isn't it? Susato: But I'm sure the gentleman's wardrobe isn't exclusively white, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Well mine is exclusively black! Susato: ...I think perhaps we should go shopping together. Ryunosuke: (There's no doubt about it. That black overcoat doesn't suit Mr Benedict at all. But we need a more tangible way of proving it...) Ryunosuke: The split seam, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Benedict: Ah! Sholmes: Yes, because the overcoat is rather obviously a poor fit. Ryunosuke: Having forced it over your broad shoulders, the seam is already breaking apart. Sholmes: My suspicions were aroused from the outset... ...when you so baldly lied about your name and so boldly waylaid this pickpocket. Benedict: Argh! Sholmes: This catalogue of untruths has all been for one very specific purpose: To steal the article that the young girl redeemed from Mr Windibank! Benedict: AAAAAARGH!!! Sholmes: But what really irks me is this: The considerable crime I initially imagined has been considerably curtailed. Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery To abscond with a redeemed item Solved Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds Sholmes: Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning. Benedict: This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, designed a wheeze to filch some tawdry article of pawnage? Have you forgotten that I redeemed the article in the proper manner, using the watchword? Had I not been the one to deposit it in the first place... ...how could I possibly have known the relevant details? N'est-ce pas? Sholmes: Oh, but the watchword can be discovered... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped. Benedict: What? Sholmes: Let us consider how one might come to learn a secret watchword relating to the pawned property of another... The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Susato: The direction of the deduction must change rather dramatically now, I think. Ryunosuke: Yes, no more talk of tunnelling into the sewers. (Which is a pity, because it all sounded rather exciting.) Anyway... ...you can't deny that this mysterious gentleman did know the watchword. Susato: Yes. 'Professor'... If you didn't know that word, Mr Windibank would never allow you to redeem the article. Ryunosuke: Or, looking at it another way... ...if you did know that word, Mr Windibank would allow you to redeem the article whether it was yours or not. (So the question is, could this gentleman have found the watchword out somehow?) The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Ryunosuke: There's no question that Mr Benedict used some wheeze or other to find out the watchword. (Let's think. He only appeared in the shop after Miss Lestrade had redeemed the overcoat...) Susato: He certainly couldn't have overheard Miss Lestrade saying the watchword. So he can only have discovered it from something on this countertop. Ryunosuke: (It sounds like I need to have another look and examine things more closely this time.) Ryunosuke: The method is revealed by the notelet on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Sholmes: Yes, the broker here follows the same procedure whenever a customer comes to redeem an article. He asks the customer for the watchword, and notes down the response uttered on a notelet he has to hand. Then he consults his ledger, and confirms whether or not the watchword matches that of the article in question. Benedict: I would expect nothing less of a diligent pawnbroker. Ryunosuke: But his diligence clearly has its disadvantages. Benedict: What are you talking about? Sholmes: It is increasingly apparent that you were present in this shop before your accusation against Miss Lestrade. Ryunosuke: In all likelihood, you followed her inside, and then observed her talking to Mr Windibank. Sholmes: When the diligent broker made a note of the watchword, as is his common practice... Ryunosuke: ...You observed him writing the word 'Professor' on the notelet beside the ledger. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: And that, sir... ...was the master plan you devised to steal the pawned article from the young Miss Lestrade! Benedict: M... Master plan?! Sholmes: Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... Why would you go to such lengths to redeem that particular article from this pawnbroker? Benedict: Are you quite serious? Sholmes: For an ill-fitting overcoat hardly seems to justify the effort, much less a worthless music box disk. But naturally, you had very good reason to make them yours, didn't you, Mr Benedict? Benedict: I have no idea what you're talking about! Sholmes: Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know. Ryunosuke: The articles we're talking about are the overcoat and the music box disk that was in one of the pockets. Susato: Which according to Mr Windibank, isn't even worth a penny. Ryunosuke: And yet this man went to such lengths to steal them... Why? Susato: I wonder if perhaps... ...we already have the evidence we need to explain it, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: (Could we? Really? I'd better have a thorough look through all the evidence we've collected so far.) Ryunosuke: You see, this music box disk tells us all we need to know. Benedict: What's that...on the back...? Sholmes: It reads, 'For McGilded'... Benedict: Agh! Sholmes: Ah, Mr Magnus McGilded... The unfortunate philanthropist who perished in curious circumstances at the Old Bailey two months ago. A prominent man in London...though his loan-mongering demonstrated a distinct lack of scruples. So...you're an associate of his, are you? Or perhaps a subordinate? Benedict: ......... Ryunosuke: Mr McGilded was a man of unusually small stature. In fact... ...he was precisely the right size for that overcoat that you've squeezed yourself into. Benedict: Ugh! Sholmes: Your true identity remains shrouded in mystery... Mr Eggert Benedict. But the final conclusion here is crystal clear. The reason you came to this pawnbrokery today... ...was to retrieve an article left behind by the late Magnus McGilded! Benedict: Tsk... AAAAAAAAARGH!!! Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds To acquire an item deposited by Mr McGilded Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Sholmes: Well well, Mr Magnus McGilded... Not a name I expected to hear in these circumstances. Benedict: ......... Susato: Mr Sholmes, I'm afraid there's something very troubling on my mind. Sholmes: Pray tell, Miss Susato. Susato: Well, according to what Mr Windibank told us earlier... ...today was the final day on which the coat could have been redeemed, was it not? Windibank: Yes, ma'am, that is correct. Today would be precisely two months since it was first deposited. Ryunosuke: Well, today is 15th April, so...two months ago today... Windibank: ...Would have been 15th February, sir, that's right. It's all carefully recorded in my ledger. Deposited at 10:30 p.m., I see. Ryunosuke: What?! But, but that suggests... Susato: Yes. 15th February... Ryunosuke: ...Is precisely the day on which the omnibus murder took place! Susato: And half past ten in the evening... ...is precisely the time at which the terrible events were unfolding! Sholmes: Suggestive is not the word. It would seem the matter is entirely beyond coincidence. Benedict: ......... You are of course at liberty to make whatever outlandish deductions you choose. However... ...I must insist you hand over the music box disk now. Ryunosuke: ...! Benedict: It would be a terrible shame to return to your native land in a box. Ryunosuke: Agh... (What do I do?!) Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank! Windibank: This is my shop! I can't allow any harm to come to my customers! If that were to happen... ...I should have to take my own life! Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank, no! ???: Alright, that's enough! Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson! Benedict: Inspector...? Gregson: That's right, sunshine. The alarm was raised on one of our dedicated emergency lines. So we got here as fast as we could. Now, what's this all about, eh? Windibank: Oh, praise be! You're here at last! I was moments away from forfeiting my own life in my very own establishment! Benedict: ......... It would seem you have the upper hand. Gregson: Right, you lot have got some explainin' to do! I don't appreciate bein' bothered with some petty argy-bargy! Susato: Petty?! Mr Windibank very nearly met with his end! Gregson: Yeah, with his own gun, as far as I can tell. Windibank: Oh dear... Gregson: And the whole of Britain could meet with its end if I don't get to the bottom of the case I'm s'posed to be workin' on! Ryunosuke: What?! What on earth is the case, Inspector? Sholmes: Spare no detail, Gregson! Gregson: ...I, I might have said a little too much. No matter. It's nothin' to do with you lot. Anyway, sir, you're gonna have to come with me down to the station. Benedict: ......... But of course, Inspector... Gregson: Aah! He's getting away! Get after him, lads! Whistle the beat officer, too!Sir! Gregson: ...There's been a spate of thefts at pawn shops round here recently. So we've fitted emergency buttons underneath the counters for brokers to let us know when there's trouble. Windibank: Oh, Inspector...I was very worried there for a while. Very worried indeed. Gregson: Now then, Mr Permanently-in-Mournin'... Ryunosuke: Oh! ...Yes? Gregson: I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over! Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, of course... Gina: No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine! Gregson: I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now. Ryunosuke: As evidence...? Sholmes: If the police demand something as evidence, my dear fellow, we have no choice but to capitulate. It's all yours, Inspector. Gina: Grrr... Ryunosuke: And so, we handed Mr McGilded's disk over to Inspector Gregson... ...and were summarily turfed out of the shop and onto the street. To be continued... Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy (before initiating Logic and Reasoning Spectacular) 15th April Baker Street Gina: See? That's why I 'ate grown-ups. All they do is feed you a pack o' lies and take stuff away from ya! Sholmes: Oh really, Miss Lestrade? ...Tell me, is that overcoat keeping you warm? Gina: Wot? Susato: Oh my! Surely, you were given that! Gina: Yeah, the dee let me keep it. After I looked daggers at 'im for long enough. 'E went through the pockets and then said, 'Go on, then, 'ave it' before tellin' me to scarper. Always pays off, givin' people a look like you 'ate 'em. Ryunosuke: I can't help feeling that it's going to get you into serious trouble one day... Gina: Wot I really wanted was that nice, shiny disk, mind. Susato: The music box disk? Ryunosuke: But Mr Windibank said it was practically worthless. Gina: I think I'm gonna go and 'ave another bash. Give 'em a long, 'ard stare. Sholmes: I think not, Miss Lestrade. We shan't enter Windibank's again today. Gina: Why not?! That's not fair! Ryunosuke: It can't be helped, I'm afraid. The police are investigating the scene now, and taking a statement from Mr Windibank. Gina: But that disk's mine! I 'ad the ticket for this coat, and it was in this coat's pocket! And there should be somefin' else an' all! That's wot that rotten cove said, ain't it? Ryunosuke: Yes, he did mention something about another article, didn't he? Gina: Well then, that's mine, too! Wotever it is! Ryunosuke: (Now she's really pushing her luck...) Sholmes: Miss Lestrade, I think it's time to admit defeat. You've had your 'haul' for the day. Gina: Yeah! And it's all your fault, Sholmes! Sholmes: So what are your plans now? Will you dine with us this evening? Gina: Eh? Sholmes: Iris would be delighted to cook, I'm sure. And I might entertain you with a modest violin recital. Gina: ......... No, ta. Sholmes: Oh... Gina: Why would I come round your place, eh? 'Ave you lost your 'ead or somefin'?! Susato: Oh dear. She's gone. Sholmes: Hm, having reviled on me quite unnecessarily, I might add. Ryunosuke: I...can't help wondering... ...if perhaps she might turn up anyway. Sholmes: Interesting... Ryunosuke: Once she's had a chance to calm down, I think there's a good chance she'll decide to come. Sholmes: ......... Very well, then. I'll inform Iris to set a place for our potential guest at the dinner table this evening. And one more thing... I should be glad of your company later, too. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: I believe I will have a rather splendid surprise to show you. Susato: Oh, how exciting! What is it? Sholmes: You shall have to wait and see, Miss Susato. ...Until later, then! 15th April, 3:46 p.m. Sholmes's Suite Iris: Ah, Susie! And Runo! Come in, come in! Ryunosuke: Good afternoon, Iris. Susato: Thank you so much for breakfast this morning. Iris: Oh, don't mention it! ...Goodness! Look at the time already! Ryunosuke: Busy as always? Iris: I am! I'm preparing everything for dinner this evening. Ryunosuke: Already? You're obviously cooking something special, are you? Iris: Oh, yes! After all, we have a special guest joining us! Guess who it is! Go on! Hee hee, you'll never guess! Ryunosuke: Um... (Look at those little eyes of hers shining!) Susato: Oh dear. It is awkward when you already know the answer, isn't it? Iris: It's Ginny! Isn't that exciting?! Susato: Oh! Oh...what a surprise! Yes, that's wonderful news! Ryunosuke: (Wow, Iris seems overjoyed at the idea!) Iris: I can't wait to learn some pickpocketing tips from a real professional! Ryunosuke: Oh yes! That does sound like fun! Susato: I'm not sure that's entirely appropriate. Are you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Erm... By the way, Iris, what's Mr Sholmes up to? Iris: Hurley? Oh, he's been like that ever since he got back. Ryunosuke: ...Hellooo! Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: I beg that you won't speak to me. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: I don't know who you are, but kindly take your leave. As you can see, I'm not here. Ryunosuke: ......... (I, I don't know how to respond to that.) Iris: I do apologise. When he gets like this, he's completely oblivious to everything. Ryunosuke: Yes... I see... Iris: Really, he behaves just like a child sometimes, Hurley does. Susato: Mr Sholmes and Iris have something of a parent-and-child relationship, don't they? Ryunosuke: Yes, except that Iris is clearly the parent here... (Come to think of it... ...I wonder where her real parents are.) Iris: What's the matter, Runo? You have ever such a funny look on your face! Ryunosuke: Oh...no...it's nothing. Iris: I know what it is! 'Why does this girl live here with Mr Sholmes?' you're wondering. ...Am I right? Ryunosuke: How?! How did you...? Iris: Heh heh, oh, Runo! I can read you like a book! Ryunosuke: (Ugh... This girl is dangerous...) Iris: Don't worry, you can ask me anything! I won't mind. After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Ah, my dear fellows! How good to see you! Susato: Eek! Mr, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Whyever did you not make your presence known to me before? Ryunosuke: ...Haah. Sholmes: Well, no matter now. So, how the devil are you? Ryunosuke: We've...been with you for most of the day. Sholmes: Goodness, really? Susato: Do tell me, Mr Sholmes, is your violin unscathed? Sholmes: Hm? My violin? Whatever are you talking about, dear madam? Susato: Oh! Um... Sholmes: Never mind that now. I have something far more interesting to show you. Behold, my dear fellows! Susato: Oh, another music box disk. Sholmes: No, not 'another' disk, Miss Susato. This is the one Gregson demanded we hand over as evidence: Mr McGilded's disk! Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: Then, then...what's it doing here?! Sholmes: Heh heh heh! You know, at times, Mr Naruhodo... ...I think that though I have an undeniable turn for detection... ...I may well be even more adept at larceny! Iris: Ooh! That would be wonderfully exciting! I'd be your pickpocketing assistant! And Runo could be our go-to lawyer if we ever got caught! Ryunosuke: Right... Iris: Plus, Susie has such beautiful handwriting, she could write all our menacing crime notifications! Susato: Yes! I'd be delighted! Ryunosuke: (I'm just going to pretend this conversation never happened, I think.) After clearing all Converse options: Iris: Well, it's time I started getting things ready for dinner, I think. Ginny will be here before long. Sholmes: Thank you, Iris. Susato: Oh, well you must let me help you, then. Iris: Of course, Susie! There's plenty to do. Sholmes: I think I shall investigate the condition of my faithful performing partner. Now then...where did I leave it...? Ryunosuke: Let this be a lesson to you, Mr Sholmes: Never leave anything too precious with the pawnbroker. Sholmes: Hm, yes... You may be right. Susato: Oh, that reminds me! Of something Mr Windibank said before. He said that he had a manuscript of Iris's in pawn, didn't he? Sholmes: Did he? Ryunosuke: Yes, he definitely mentioned it. 'Mr Sholmes's latest tale of otherworldly mystery lies dormant in my storeroom,' were his words, I believe. Iris: So you heard about that, did you? I expect you were as incensed as I was! Susato: Oh yes! The idea of such a wonderful story languishing in Mr Windibank's storeroom, gathering dust... Sholmes: My dear madam, I'm quite sure I told you already... ...the pawnbroker's storeroom is the safest place for it. More secure than a bank's vault! Iris: And what about your Stradivarius, Hurley? Was that safe and secure? Sholmes: Weeell... There may be the occasional mix-up. Ryunosuke: (Caused by a certain impetuous someone not too far from me now...) Iris: Do you have any idea how long it took me to write that Baskerville story, Hurley? Susato: Oh, it sounds so exciting! 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'! I should love to read it! Iris: ......... Sholmes: ......... Susato: .........Ah! Ryunosuke: ......... (What's going on here? Why does it feel like an icy chill just swept through the room?) Iris: Susie...what did you just say? Susato: Erm... Iris: You said...'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... But...how could you know the full title? Susato: Well, that's... ......... Ryunosuke: That's because Miss Susato is such a great fan of all the stories about Mr Sholmes, of course. Iris: But Runo, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... ...has never been published. Ryunosuke: What? Iris: When I showed Hurley the manuscript, he told me that I wasn't allowed to publish it yet. Ryunosuke: I don't understand... Iris: That's why he said that he'd keep it safe. Until it was the right time for the story to be made public, you see. Ryunosuke: So that's why the manuscript is at Windibank's...? Iris: And yet, how could Susie here know its title? Well Hurley? What's going on? Sholmes: ......... ...Ah! Ryunosuke: ...? What is it, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: It would appear our guest has arrived. Ryunosuke: Miss Lestrade! Gina: ......... ...This was a bad idea. I knew I weren't welcome. I'm goin'! Ryunosuke: No! Wait! ...Miss Lestrade! We've all been eagerly awaiting your arrival. ...Haven't we, Iris? Iris: ......... Oh yes! Just wait there, Ginny. We'll have everything ready in a jiffy! Come along, Susie! Susato: Right! Of course! It's a pleasure to see you here, Miss Lestrade. Please, make yourself at home! Sholmes: Don't stand in the doorway, my dear girl. Come along in! What say you to some Mendelssohn? I won't take 'no' for an answer! Ryunosuke: ...Meddlesome it is, then. Gina: ......... Wagahai: ...Miaow. Ryunosuke: That evening... ...Iris prepared us all a meal that was even more delicious than usual... ...Mr Sholmes's violin performance was in no way meddlesome... ...and Gina, as we came to call her, taught us all how to steal things from one another without being noticed. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves...well into the night. 15th April, 9:34 p.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Ryunosuke: That was a very enjoyable evening, wasn't it? Susato: Oh yes! Iris's cooking was truly divine! Ryunosuke: And I feel as though I can still hear the enchanting strains of Mr Sholmes's violin even now. Susato: Best of all...I bet I could steal the glasses from His Lordship's face next time we're in court! ......... Naruhodo-san...could I consult with you about something, I wonder? Ryunosuke: What's the matter, Susato-san? Susato: ......... It's...about the telegram I received. Ryunosuke: Ah... (The one that arrived first thing this morning, I suppose.) Susato: ......... I've...I've been summoned. Ryunosuke: What?! Summoned? ...What do you mean? Susato: The telegram was from the Lord Chief Justice's office. Lord Stronghart has asked to see me. Ryunosuke: The Lord Chief Justice? ...When? Susato: Tomorrow morning. Ryunosuke: What?! Then, then we have to start preparing at once! Susato: Oh! No...that won't be necessary, Naruhodo-san. I've been summoned alone. Ryunosuke: Alone? What on earth for? Susato: ......... I have no idea. I suppose I shall find out tomorrow. Ryunosuke: (What's all this about? Whatever it is, it's making me feel very uneasy...) *Knock knock* Ryunosuke: (Oh, who could that be, I wonder?) Iris: Good evening, friends! Ryunosuke: Ah, Iris. Hello again. Gina: ......... Susato: And Gina, too. Iris: Yes! Ginny's going to stay with us tonight. She's going to sleep in with me! ...Isn't that right, Ginny? Gina: Well...yeah... Susato: How lovely! Let me make a pot of tea. Iris: You know, I've learnt so much today! Susato: Oh, what...in particular? Iris: All those things Ginny showed us! Wasn't it wonderful? Ryunosuke: Ah, you mean all those pickpocketing techniques? We had fun trying them out on each other, didn't we? Iris: I think I've awakened a natural talent! I could earn a living from it! Ryunosuke: (...You might be getting ahead of yourself a little there.) So...what brings you up to our humble quarters at this late hour? Iris: Well, you see... ...I came to return this. Ryunosuke: Wait, what?! That's, that's mine! Susato: Oh my! However did you...? Iris: I told you, didn't I? I have a natural talent for it! Ryunosuke: (Oh yes, I'd forgotten... ...Iris literally is a child genius.) Iris: So anyway, here...you can have it back. Not that I really understand why you wear it, though. Ryunosuke: Ah. Thank you. Iris: Alright then, good night! Ryunosuke: Yes, good night. Iris: ......... Hm... So this is your office, is it? What do you think, Ginny? Gina: I think I wouldn't fancy me chances wiv a lawyer wot lives in a place like this. Iris: Yes! Me too! Hahahaha! Ryunosuke: (It seems as though Iris here... ...still has something she'd like to talk about.) Susato: I suppose...she probably wants to talk about the manuscript. Ryunosuke: (Yes, I suppose she probably does.) After clearing all Converse options with Iris Wilson and Gina Lestrade: Iris: Oh my goodness! Look at the time! Come along, Ginny, we should go back downstairs. Gina: Yeah...alright. Iris: And please, don't mention any of this to Hurley, will you? Ryunosuke: No...of course not. Good night then, Iris. Good night, Gina. Susato: You must let me make breakfast for you tomorrow morning! I insist! Iris: Oh, yes please! I can't wait, Susie! Good night, then! Ryunosuke: (Iris... It sure is easy to forget, isn't it? Sometimes she speaks just like an adult. But deep down, she's still just a child.) Susato: Well, I think it's time that I turned in for the night, too, Naruhodo-san. Ryunosuke: Dr John H. Wilson... Iris's father... But also... ...the name of the murdered visiting professor at Yumei University. It can't be a mere coincidence... There's something deeper going on... ........................... .................. ......... ???: ...ster Naruhodo... ...Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: (That voice... That's...Mr Sholmes!) What's going on? It's the middle of the night. Sholmes: It's Miss Lestrade... She's gone. Ryunosuke: Gina? Sholmes: She was supposed to be sleeping in Iris's room. But her bed is empty. Ryunosuke: Well...she's an independent young woman. She probably decided to go home, no? Sholmes: I think not. From speaking to her before she retired... ...I received the distinct impression that she was looking forward to breakfasting with Miss Susato. No, I don't believe the girl has gone home. But I've been waiting for over an hour now. Ryunosuke: Over an hour? Oh... Sholmes: If you'll indulge me, look out of the window, my dear fellow. Ryunosuke: (What's this about?) ...! Wait a minute... (Why is there a light on at this time of night?) Sholmes: That's Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery. Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank's... (Oh no!) Gina: It's simple! If that story was really in old Windibank's storeroom... ...there's no way someone from 'alf way around the world - in other words, you - could know about it. Gina: Sorry, Iris, but if you ask me, 'e's sold it. Wivout tellin' you. Ryunosuke: (Could Gina have gone...?) Sholmes: It seems you have some knowledge of the situation, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? ...Oh, no! No, not really. Sholmes: Well anyway, we must investigate. ???: At once! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! 16th April, 1:14 a.m. Baker Street Ryunosuke: The door to Windibank's... It's open! Susato: And the lamp is burning. Ryunosuke: It must be Gina...mustn't it? Sholmes: Let us hope it's nothing more sinister. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: Come, there's not a moment to lose! Clearly something is afoot inside! Ryunosuke: ...There's no one here... Sholmes: ...Oh yes... ...there is! *BANG!* Susato: AAAAAAAH!!! Mr Sholmes! Mr Shooolmes!!! Ryunosuke: What the- (Has Sholmes been shot?!) Sholmes: Leave me, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: But... Sholmes: After them! Go! Ryunosuke: Right! Ryunosuke: ...Blast! (I've lost them!) ???: 'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere? Bobby: The alarm was just raised from this pawnbroker's sir. Would you know somethin' about that? Ryunosuke: Officer! Come with me! It's my friend! Mr Sholmes! He's been shot! Bobby: Shot?! Ryunosuke: With the policeman close behind me, I ran back to Windibank's... Anime cutscene Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! Susato: Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: How bad is it? Sholmes: Agh...never mind me. But there's much at stake. Behind that door... In the storeroom! ...Hurry! Ryunosuke: Huh?! It's...it's Gina?! To be continued... *BANG!* AAAAAAAH!!! I'll be alright, Mr Naruhodo! After them! Go! Behind that door. In the storeroom! ...Hurry! It's...it's Gina?! From that moment, Windibank's Pawnbrokery became a crime scene. Everything that followed happened in a whirlwind of activity. The arrival of the police, the preliminary investigation of the scene and the questioning... It was just before dawn before I was allowed back to my lodgings at 221B. 16th April, 6:21 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Ryunosuke: Oh! Iris! Iris: A telegram came. But all it said was, 'Wait at home'. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, we asked one of the policemen to have it sent. It was simply impossible to come back. Iris: When I woke up...I was all alone. Hurley and Ginny were gone. Everyone was gone. What happened, Runo? Ryunosuke: (Poor Iris. She's trembling. She's obviously trying very hard not to let herself get too worried.) ...I'll explain everything that I know. Iris: Something awful has happened, hasn't it? Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, I'm afraid so. After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: I'm afraid I'll need to go out again now, Iris. There's not much I can do at the moment... But I can at least try to find out how Mr Sholmes and Gina are getting on. Iris: I want to go, too. Take me with you, Runo! Ryunosuke: ...! Iris: I can't stand just sitting around here waiting. Ryunosuke: (I'm not sure how I feel about taking a ten-year-old child to the scene of a murder... But I don't want to leave her all alone here, either.) Alright then, Iris. Perhaps you can help me? Iris: Oh yes! I'd love to! Ryunosuke: Gina's at the prison. Mr Sholmes is...probably in his hospital bed. Iris: And don't forget we have to visit the crime scene! We need to conduct a thorough investigation! Ryunosuke: Ah, I can see you're ready for action! (I imagine Iris would appreciate going to the hospital sooner rather than later...) Sholmes's Suite Baker Street 16th April St Synner's Hospital, Ward 3 Iris: Hurley! ...Oh! He's not here! Ryunosuke: No. That's strange... The nurse definitely said he was in the bed by the window, didn't she? Iris: Ooh, I know what's probably happened! Hurley was being a big baby. And the bullet wound wasn't that bad after all so he's been sent home. Ryunosuke: Hm, I'm not so sure about that. Baby or not... ...there's no question that it was a fairly serious injury that Mr Sholmes suffered. Iris: Oh... ???: 'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere? Bobby: This ward is off limits! No visitin'! So what are you doin' in 'ere, eh? Iris: Well, I'll have you know, we're Hurley's next of kin! Bobby: Eh? ...Oh! Well beggin' your pardon then, ma'am. Sir. ...A little lady and a curious Eastern gentleman... The great mystery-solver 'as a mysterious family, eh. Ryunosuke: (...If that's how you see us, um...sure.) Iris: Where is he, Constable? Where's Hurley? Bobby: I believe 'e is currently in the operatin' theatre, ma'am. Undergoin' an extensive operation. Iris: Extensive?! Bobby: It 'as been several 'ours since 'e went in. Iris: Oh dear... Is he going to be alright? Bobby: Well, it doesn't appear to be workin', you see. The anaesthetic, that is. Iris: Oh! Bobby: I 'ave 'eard a report that the gentleman claims 'e may 'ave 'ad a little too much to drink last night. Coffee, that is. Ryunosuke: Haah... Bobby: Anyway, I think it would be fair to assume that 'e won't be back 'ere for several 'ours yet. Ryunosuke: ...I see. Thank you, Constable. Perhaps we should leave and come back later. Iris: Oh, poor Hurley... 16th April Windibank's Pawnbrokery Iris: This is where it happened, then? Last night. Ryunosuke: That's right. The two thugs I told you about were obviously ransacking the place, looking for valuables. Iris: But... ...apart from the policemen in here, you wouldn't know anything had happened. There's no sign of a disturbance. Ryunosuke: No...you're right about that, actually. Iris: In fact, if anyone, it's the police who seem to be the ones doing the ransacking. Ryunosuke: I know what you mean. They're like a gang of organised criminals, all dressed in black! ???: Oi! I heard that! Ryunosuke: Oh, Inspector! Erm... Good morning. Gregson: Hmph. I s'pose I ought to thank you for your vigilance last night. We got to the scene before it was disturbed at least. Shame you let the two rogues get away, mind. Ryunosuke: Yes... I'm sorry about that. Iris: ...I thought you'd assigned extra men to the beat around here, Gregsy. Now look what's happened! Hurley's been injured because there weren't enough police on duty! Gregson: .........Ah! Y...Y...Your Ladyship! No one told me you were comin'! Iris: I expect you to take full responsibility for what happened to Hurley and see he has the very best medical care! Gregson: Of course, Your Ladyship! The very best doctors in the capital are tendin' to him as we speak! Iris: And I don't think it's Runo's fault that the rogues managed to get away, is it? Chasing criminals is the police's job. Gregson: Absolutely, Your Ladyship! As you say, ma'am, as you say! The gent in black is totally blameless! Everyone's in agreement about that. Ryunosuke: (Would you believe it?! He's like a completely different person with Iris. Talk about a personality change...) Gregson: Oh! Where are me manners? Are you thirsty, Your Ladyship? Perhaps you'd like some juice? Some nice, refreshin' fruit juice? Iris: Oh, why? Are you thirsty, Gregsy? I have some of my special herbal tea with me, if you'd like some! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Ta very much. That really hit the spot...Your Ladyship. Ryunosuke: (I don't even recognise him like this...) After clearing all Converse options: Gregson: Oh...yeah...there's somethin' I was s'posed to talk to you about, actually, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Yes? What is it? Gregson: I've got an important message for you. I clean forgot about it until now. Ryunosuke: An important message? (I wonder what it could be...) 16th April British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: (Yes... ...no matter how many times I come here, I always get the same sense of oppressiveness somehow...) Iris: Do you think the place is oppressive? I think it's normal. Ryunosuke: How so?! Iris: I mean, look at that suit of armour over there. You can't take that seriously, can you? Ryunosuke: ...Maybe it thinks the same about you. ???: ...So everything is clear with regard to tomorrow's arrangements, I trust? ???: Yes. Thank you very much. Ryunosuke: (There they are. Susato-san and Lord Stronghart.) Iris: I wonder what they're talking about. They both look very serious. Stronghart: Very good. There is nothing further to discuss. You may return to your lodgings. No doubt you have much to do in preparation for your return to your homeland. Ryunosuke: ......... (...Wait, what did he just say? 'Your return to your homeland'...?) Susato-san! Susato: ...! Oh! Um...Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: ......... What was all that about? Susato: ......... Stronghart: Ah, Mr Naruhodo. Thank you for coming to collect your colleague. Ryunosuke: What's this all about? Why were you talking about Miss Susato's 'return to her homeland'? And, and... ...tomorrow?! Susato: ......... Iris: Tomorrow...? But what about Ginny's trial? Susato: ...! You mean... ...she's been formally charged now? Oh dear... Iris: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Stronghart: ...Three minutes precisely until my next meeting. You must excuse me. Ryunosuke: ......... There's just...one more thing, Lord Stronghart. Stronghart: Which is? Ryunosuke: It's Miss Lestrade's trial... I wonder if you might permit me to defend her? Stronghart: ......... A timely suggestion. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Stronghart: The girl currently has no representation. Iris: But, but that's not fair! Yes, she may be a pickpocket, but she still deserves a fair trial! Stronghart: ...Do not misunderstand me, young lady. The government provides for those too poor to afford representation with a public defender. The accused need only sign the relevant paperwork, and a defence barrister will be assigned to the case. However...the young girl in question has refused that right. Ryunosuke: Why would she do that? Stronghart: A question you would do well to direct at Miss Lestrade. You'll find her at the local prison. Ryunosuke: Yes, thank you. Stronghart: Now then, it's time I was leaving. Good day to you. Ryunosuke: (What a day. Gina charged with murder... Susato-san about to leave...) Susato: ......... Come, Mr Naruhodo. Iris. We must make haste. Iris: But, Susie... ...you're leaving for Japan tomorrow morning, aren't you? Don't you have packing and things to do? Susato: ......... As Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant, my personal circumstances are of no consequence. My sole purpose remains to help you in whatever way I can. Ryunosuke: ...Thank you, Miss Susato. (That's a very pensive look...) Ryunosuke: (If I'm honest, this has completely thrown me off. I'll just have to do what I can...as a lawyer...) 16th April Local Prison, Cell 13 After clearing all Converse options at Local Prison, Cell 13 and Lord Chief Justice's Office: Susato: Gina... ...I wonder if you might hear me out. There's something I'd like to say. Gina: Wot? Susato: I'm sorry to say...that I must reluctantly bid you farewell. Gina: Eh? Farewell? Susato: Tomorrow, I must begin my journey back home. To Japan. ...I fear we may never meet again. Gina: ...! Oh...right... Susato: I've had the pleasure of meeting so many lovely people here in London. I have so many wonderful memories. And yet...as things stand now... ...it will be a glum parting indeed. Poor Iris is so miserable. Iris: Susie... Gina: Well...well...that ain't my business! Susato: Both Iris and Mr Naruhodo believe you to be innocent, Gina. They've put their faith in you. But somehow...you can't find it in your heart to put your faith in them. Gina: Yeah! That's right, I can't! ...Wot of it? Susato: It grieves me greatly to have to say goodbye to my friends when they are so clearly unhappy... ...because of you. Gina: ...! Wot, it's MY fault?! Susato: Yes. So I have one final request, Gina, before our paths never cross again. Right here and now... ...I want you to show both of them that you don't deserve the faith they've invested in you. Gina: Eh?! Susato: Only by doing that... ...will you truly be as alone as you claim to be. Gina: ...! Wot are you talkin' about? Wot d'you expect me to do, eh? Susato: You've told us that everyone lies. So prove it! ...By admitting one of your own untruths. Gina: ......... Iris: What about what you said before, Ginny? You said something about unforgivable lies. Susato: You must tell Mr Naruhodo and Iris the truth now. That is my last request before I leave. My last request as a judicial assistant. Gina: No... I, I can't... Ryunosuke: (Whatever these lies are, they're obviously weighing very heavily on Gina's mind...) Gina, I could be wrong, but... ...is it something to do with what happened two months ago? Something about that trial? The one in which Magnus McGilded was acquitted? Gina: Ah... Ryunosuke: The case of that mysterious murder that took place inside the omnibus... You were called as a witness by the prosecution. Is that what this is about? Gina: ......... Yeah. You're right. Because...in that trial... ...I lied. I lied like you wouldn't believe. Ryunosuke: ......... Will you tell us about it now? Gina: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Gina: ......... I bet yer ready to string me up, eh? I lied...in that big old courtroom. I told some corkers. Ryunosuke: ......... Gina: The thing is, 'e said 'e would make it so we couldn't live in the East End no more. That's wot 'e threatened me wiv. Iris: What a wicked man... Gina: 'E knew everyfin' wot went on in the back slums. 'E knew we 'ad no one to look after us, and we was all just lookin' out for each other, gettin' by together. Susato: So you mean...Mr McGilded would have- Gina: In an 'eartbeat! 'E could've 'ad the lot of us chased out o' there if 'e'd wanted. And then where could we 'ave gone, eh? Nowhere, that's where! So... I didn't 'ave no choice. ......... Ryunosuke: Thank you, Gina, for telling us everything. Gina: But...I'm for it now, eh?! Go on, admit it! You must be livid! Ryunosuke: Well...you can make amends by doing me a simple favour. Gina: ...A favour? Wot? Ryunosuke: Sign the representation papers for tomorrow's trial. Gina: Eh?! Ryunosuke: If you don't actually want me to represent you in court, you can rip it up later. But we need that paperwork or we can't investigate. The police won't let us. Gina: Investigate wot? Ryunosuke: The scene of the incident last night. Mr Sholmes was shot, you see. Gina: You wot?! Iris: Hurley's having a big operation right now, Ginny. Gina: Is it bad?! Is, is 'e gonna be alright? Sholmes is gonna be alright...right? Iris: ......... Ryunosuke: That's why I want to investigate. For Mr Sholmes's sake as much as anything. Gina: ......... Right. So wot yer sayin' is, if I sign that bit o' paper, everyone's 'appy, is that it? Ryunosuke: Something like that. ...Miss Susato? Susato: Yes! Of course! I have the representation papers here. Gina: ......... ...I, I don't need no one to stick up for me, though. No lawyer or nuffin'. Iris: Poor Ginny... She seems so lonely. Gina's representation papers have been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: Well...at least this should mean we can investigate the scene at Windibank's now. Iris: Yes. And perhaps we can come back to visit Ginny when we're done there? Ryunosuke: (I feel like we've finally cracked Gina. She's opened up to us at last. And now I have her representation papers... No one else knows just what a responsibility that is. Anyway, for now it means Inspector Gregson can't stop us investigating at Windibank's. Although something tells me he's not going to be happy about it...) To be continued... 16th April, 1:26 p.m. Windibank's Pawnbrokery Ryunosuke: (Here we are again at the scene of the crime... Now to thrust these representation papers in Gregson's face and see what he makes of them!) Hello again, Inspector. Do you have a minute, please? Gregson: What is it now? You should go home and get some rest. Iris: Here you are, Gregsy! Here are the representation papers! Gregson: .........Your Ladyship! Hooooooooooooooooooooow?! I don't believe it! How the devil did you get that stubborn little ragabash to sign that?! I salute you! That is good work, that is. Iris: I can see you've been very busy here as well. How about some tea? It's a special blend designed to relieve fatigue! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Well, let's see now... Yes... Yes! I hardly feel tired at all! I'm fit as a fiddle, Your Ladyship! Ryunosuke: ...Would it be alright if we investigated the scene of the crime, then? Gregson: Do as you please! You know where it happened. Through that door behind the counter. Ryunosuke: (Yes, the storeroom... That's where I discovered Mr Windibank...and Gina.) Gregson: Right, well...I'll be gettin' back to business then. Ryunosuke: Will you be investigating in the storeroom as well, Inspector? Gregson: If I'm perfectly honest, we need to wrap this up before long. Can't afford to spend too much time on it. But there are so many articles to go through, it's taking forever, even with the lads workin' round the clock. Which is a problem, 'cause there's another case the Yard needs to investigate urgently. Ryunosuke: (That must be what Lord Stronghart meant by 'far more serious matters' before...) Gregson: So what I'm sayin' is, don't get under my feet, sunshine! Susato: Come then! Let us not waste any time! After clearing all Converse options: Iris: So what do you think of these stereoscopic prints then, Runo? Ryunosuke: They're certainly amazing, but it isn't easy to get the knack of viewing them properly. Iris: No, some people find it easier than others. But that's why contraptions like this exist. For people who find it tricky. Susato: Oh! I recognise that. We saw one over there yesterday, didn't we? If I remember correctly, you press this little knob here... ...then set the pair of photographs in this stand at the back and... Ryunosuke: It's still amazing, even though I know roughly how it works now. Iris: Well, London seems to agree with you. Stereoscopes are very popular at the moment. You can find one of these folding contraptions in lots of households in the capital currently. Ryunosuke: But if these little machines are so affordable... ...surely there's no need to go around staring cross-eyed at pictures like you hate them. Iris: ......... But it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Well, I think so, in any case. Ryunosuke: (Stereoscopic pictures... I'd never even heard of them until yesterday. We've certainly learnt a lot about them. But I wonder if it's knowledge that I'll ever actually need...) The second white cat photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Iris: Oh! That looks like blood! Ryunosuke: I would say it's from a gloved finger. Almost certainly a glove made of leather. iris: Well don't worry, Runo! You can leave the rest to me! Ryunosuke: Look at that... Iris: Yes, that's a colour we haven't seen before, isn't it? Susato: We simply must add it to the portfolio of blood samples! It could be an important clue. Although...it would be nice to find out whose blood these different colours correspond to at some point. Ryunosuke: ......... (Well, this particular stain of blood...) Iris: Oh! You've had an idea, haven't you? Do you know whose blood this is? Ryunosuke: Yes, I have an idea whose blood it is. Not from the colour it turned, but with a little deduction. Iris: That's right! I think it's clear. Susato: Iris, you know as well? Iris: You first, Runo. Who do you think it belongs to? Ryunosuke: Alright, I believe that this is the blood of... Ryunosuke: ...'Thrice-Fired' Mason...? Iris: You don't sound very sure of yourself, the way you trailed off there. Ryunosuke: Well it was two months ago now, that case. And of course I'd never met the victim. So I'm struggling to remember his name. He was definitely 'Thrice-Fired', though. Susato: The victim...of the omnibus case? Yes, his name was indeed Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason. But that would mean that this bloodstain... ...was left on the ticket two months ago! Ryunosuke: Yes. I think it was. Gina brought this ticket here to Windibank's yesterday. I'm suggesting that the bloodstain was already on it at that time. Iris: So it's a smear of blood from the time that Mr Mason was killed two months ago! Susato: Something else is coming back to me now... Mr McGilded was also wearing leather gloves that night. McGilded: Now I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand. Ryunosuke: It certainly does look like a leather-gloved thumbprint, this mark. But we know that Mr McGilded had no injuries at the time, anywhere on his body. From which we can conclude... ...that any blood on the glove...belonged to the victim, Mr Mason! Susato: Mr Naruhodo! You sound just like Mr Sholmes! Ryunosuke: (...Minus the quirky slip-ups, I hope.) Iris: Yes, I think you're right, Runo! Susato: Very well. Let's make a note of this. The details of the pawnbroker's ticket for the coat have been updated in the Court Record. The blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record. 16th April Local Prison, Cell 13 Ryunosuke: Gina doesn't appear to be here. Susato: I believe she must be in questioning at the moment. Iris: Oh, but...wait a minute... Ryunosuke: What is it, Iris? Iris: Well if you examine the scene here carefully, there's another possibility, isn't there? Ginny could have slipped the key from the jailer when he wasn't looking and escaped! Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: Why, why would she do something like that? It would only make her situation worse! Iris: ......... Calm down, Runo! I was only joking of course! Ryunosuke: ......... Oh. Ugh...you had me worried there. I thought it was a 'great deduction'. Susato: Yes, it must be your way with words, Iris. You're so wonderfully persuasive. Perhaps you don't fully understand the weight your words carry. Iris: Oh dear... I'm sorry. I suppose a light-hearted great detective is a contradiction in terms. Ryunosuke: Well, in the same situation, I'm sure Mr Sholmes would just have thrown his head back and guffawed. Susato: I'm not entirely sure that's helpful, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Well anyway, it looks like we won't be able to talk to Gina for a while. We should try to make progress with our investigation in the meantime. Iris: Yes. Come along then, Runo! Come along, Susie! 16th April Windibank's Storeroom Iris: ......... Ryunosuke: (Poor Iris... She's clammed up completely.) Susato: Iris is bound to find this difficult. After all, Mr Windibank's life was taken in this very room only last night. Iris: ......... Gregson: .........Ah! Ryunosuke: Wait! Inspector! Gregson: What is it now, sunshine? Ryunosuke: You took one look at me and tried to run away! Gregson: You think a Scotland Yard inspector would run away from some jumped-up little defence lawyer, do ya? Iris: ......... Gregson: I just! Well... ...I've never seen Her Ladyship lookin' like that before, is the thing. I didn't know what to say to her. Ryunosuke: (So you weren't running away from me...you were running away from a ten-year-old.) Susato: I'm afraid this is all a little much for young Iris. Some gentle reassurance might go a long way perhaps, Inspector. Gregson: Eh?! Iris: ......... Gregson: Erm... Ahem! Don't, um... Don't trouble yourself unduly, Your Ladyship. I mean...at least you're not dead, are you? Ryunosuke: ...I don't think that went very well. Gregson: ......... WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! Look! I'm in the middle of an investigation here, sunshine! And I told you not to get under my feet! Susato: And we have investigating to do ourselves. Ryunosuke: Yes. I'd like to hear more of what the socially inept inspector has to say. Iris: Oh Hurley... Ryunosuke: (And enquire into how Mr Sholmes's operation is going...) After clearing all Converse options, examining calendar, and presenting Pawnbroker's Ticket (Coat) in Windibank's Main Shop, and clearing all Converse options, examining chalk outline, red chest, and revolver in Windibank's Storeroom: *Dong* *Dong* *Dong* Iris: AAAAAAGH!!! I nearly jumped out of my skin there! How could Mr Windibank set such a wicked trap?! Ryunosuke: I...I doubt he set out to scare anyone. Susato: Is that really the time? I think perhaps we should pay Gina another visit soon. Ryunosuke: Oh? Susato: Her trial is tomorrow. We must establish whether or not you will be defending her. I think we should ask her one more time. ...She may have changed her mind. Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: Don't you remember, Runo? You told her she could rip up the representation papers if she didn't want you to be her lawyer. Ryunosuke: ...Really? Did I say that? Yes. You did. Susato: The deadline for submitting the paperwork is fast approaching. Ryunosuke: (In that case, we had better hurry back to the prison and talk to Gina again.) 16th April, 5:41 p.m. Local Prison, Cell 13 Ryunosuke: Ah, Gina, good... You're back. Gina: Ah! ......... Susato: The police must have finished questioning her, then. Iris: Oh, how was it, Ginny? Was it awful? Gina: Eh? Oh... Didn't bother me. Ryunosuke: Thank you for the papers you signed before. It meant we were able to investigate at Windibank's. Gina: Oh...right... ......... Iris: Don't you want to know how we got on? We've been ever so busy. Gina: ......... Wot's the point in askin'? Won't change wot everyone's sayin'. That I did it. Iris: That's not... Gina: ......... Ryunosuke: Gina, we came to ask for your final decision. Gina: Eh? Wot decision? Ryunosuke: About tomorrow's trial. Will you let me defend you or not? Gina: ...! Susato: I must submit the paperwork now if you'd like Mr Naruhodo to represent you. Gina: Right...I see... Ryunosuke: (She's really lost her fight all of a sudden. But I know what that feels like. The worry is just so hard to bear...) Ryunosuke: Those stains on the sleeves of your new coat, Gina... They're blood, aren't they? Not that I know whose blood yet. Gina: WOT?! Susato: B-Blood, Mr Naruhodo?! Ryunosuke: You don't appear to have any obvious wounds yourself, though. So could it be blood that spattered from Mr Windibank when he was shot last night? Iris: Let's not beat around the bush here. This trusty friend of mine will get results much faster than anything else! Gina: Eh?! T-Take it easy, Iris! Iris: Don't move, Ginny! I'm going to shoot! Oh... Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: What the...? Forget the sleeves... Iris: ...The whole coat is covered in blood! Ryunosuke: (Of course! The black colour of the fabric was masking the stains. That's why we haven't seen them until now!) Susato: And the blood has reacted with the chemical to turn a purple colour... ...which matches one of the samples we've already collected perfectly! Iris: Yes, now let's see...who had the purple blood? Aha! Yes, it was the brickmaker, Mr Mason. The victim of the murder case two months ago. Ryunosuke: ......... (I knew it...) Gina: Wot, wot are you all on about? The victim? Wot d'you mean? Susato: ......... It's a rather uncomfortable situation, Mr Naruhodo, but I think this makes things quite clear. It means the omnibus case is finally solved. The truth about who really murdered the brickmaker, Mr Mason...is revealed. Gina: Oi! Would someone explain wot's goin' on?! Stop tellin' 'alf a story! Susato: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Susato: Gina...may I ask you something? Gina: Wot? Susato: I'd just like to make absolutely sure... What would you like us to do with these representation papers for tomorrow's trial? Gina: ......... 'Ow many times do I 'ave to say it? Rip 'em up and chuck 'em away. Susato: Are you really sure that's what you want? Gina: I bet that's wot 'e wants an' all now. Mr 'I'm-a-Believer' Lawyer over there. Ryunosuke: ......... Gina: Don't forget it was me in that trial two months ago. I led everyone up the garden path, didn't I? An' yer tellin' me you can believe in me after that? Not likely. Susato: ......... Well, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: (A lawyer's primary weapon is an unwavering belief in his clients... Ultimately it comes down to whether or not I feel I can trust Gina after everything that's happened...) Ryunosuke: Gina...let me say it again... Please allow me to represent you in tomorrow's trial. Gina: Eh? Are you 'alf-baked? Ryunosuke: Not at all. You've not once admitted to committing the crime, have you? What's more...I believe that you're telling me the truth. Gina: ......... Seriously, um...Mr Narrow-'Oddo... ...didn't you 'ear all of wot I said before? I'm a born liar. Fibs just trip off me tongue. And I'm a diver, don't forget. I pulled the wool over yer eyes two months ago and got you into all sorts o' trouble. Why would you ever trust me now? I just don't get it! Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Gina... Gina: ...! Susato: ...I do understand why you choose not to put your trust in others. But I assure you, there is more to this life than you yet realise. Gina: Wot d'you mean? Susato: The world we live in... ...is full of people you would do very well to trust. People who won't ever let you down. Gina: Eh? Ryunosuke: It's true that I'm just a student of law, and I'm certainly lacking in courtroom experience. But I can promise you this: Whatever happens...and until my very last breath... ...I am completely on your side! Gina: ......... Wot...wot d'you expect me to say to that? ......... Susato: Then it's decided. I will take these papers now and carry out the necessary preparations for tomorrow's trial. It would be a shame to throw them away now after it's been penned with your name so beautifully. Gina: ...Do wot you like. You Eastern lot are...are... I dunno wot you are! I don't get ya! Ryunosuke: (Gina's taken herself off to the back of her cell. She'd never admit it, but I hope she's feeling relieved. That turned out alright in the end...I think.) ........................... Susato: Whoever's hiding there... ...show yourself at once! Eavesdropping is the height of cowardice! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato?! Susato: Somebody is there in the shadows. I can sense it. Somebody who wasn't there before! Ryunosuke: What?! ???: ......... ...Blimey, you're sharp, eh? Gregson: I s'pose you were usin' one of those mystic Japanese arts. Like the art of stealth I've heard so much about. Ryunosuke: ...If anyone was being stealthy, it was you, Inspector. Iris: Gregsy! Gregson: Oh dear me, I am most terribly sorry, Your Ladyship! I didn't mean to startle you! Iris: How long have you been listening in on our conversation? Gregson: Good grief! Listenin' in?! No no no! I just got word that there were some visitors who were refusin' to leave even though it was after hours. I assure you, Your Ladyship, I only just arrived. This very minute! Not a moment earlier! That's all it is! Nothin' untoward! Nothin' at all! Ryunosuke: After hours...? Is it that late already? Gregson: So then, I'll humbly excuse myself now, Your Ladyship. Ta-ta! Toodle-oo! Cheerio! All the best! Bye, by and by! Ryunosuke: (That's a lot of farewells, and not one of them appropriate for 'Her Ladyship'.) Iris: Oh, but I wanted to have a chat! Gregson: I'm, I'm terribly sorry, but time is pressin' at the minute. Iris: Oh, I see. ...That's a shame. Gregson: If I don't get this emergency at the Supreme Court dealt with sharpish, Lord  Stronghart will, well... Iris: Emergency?! Ryunosuke: Lord Stronghart? Gregson: Nothin'! Forget I said anythin'! Anyway...ahem! I'm off! Iris: Alright, Gregsy, if you have to. But let's chat soon! Gregson: Delighted! Charmed! Can't wait! If you please! My pleasure! Ryunosuke: (That's a lot of pleasantries, and not one of them sounded sincere...) Iris: Gregsy's so funny! He says such silly things! Ryunosuke: It's certainly entertaining to see an inspector of the police fawning to a ten-year-old girl. (But anyway, I wonder what this emergency is at the Supreme Court...) Susato: I must attend the court clerk's office now before it closes. Ryunosuke: Yes, of course. Thank you, Miss Susato. Susato: ......... Kindly escort Iris home now, Mr Naruhodo. I shall meet you there later. Ryunosuke: And so our investigation came to an end. Susato-san went to file the necessary papers for my defence of Gina the following day. And then it hit me... I could no longer suppress the wretched feeling that had been gnawing away at my insides. Tomorrow...Susato-san would be leaving. Leaving Britain and making her way back to Japan. 16th April, 11:13 p.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Susato: Naruhodo-san... ...it's been a very trying day, hasn't it? I do hope you're not too exhausted. Ryunosuke: What about you, Susato-san? Today has been even more trying for you, I'm sure. (Mr Sholmes was shot before our eyes, Gina was arrested... ...all on the back of the news that her father has fallen ill and that she must return to Japan at once.) I...hope your father recovers soon. Susato: Thank you for your kind words. ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: I wonder why it is... ...that so many thoughts rage in my head like a storm... ...and yet I seem unable to find the words to express any of them. Ryunosuke: I know exactly what you mean. Susato: Anyway, I have one final task to complete as your judicial assistant. Once that is done, I shall make preparations for my departure tomorrow. Ryunosuke: (One final task...?) After clearing all Converse options: Susato: Well...it's getting rather late. I think you should go to bed now, Naruhodo-san. I must finish packing up my things in my room. Ryunosuke: Susato-san, I... Susato: I wish you the very best of luck tomorrow! ...Good night. Ryunosuke: Wait! There's, there's something I need to say! Susato: Haiiiiii-YA! Ryunosuke: What, what was that...? Susato: A secret technique of mine... The 'Susato Shutdown'. Ryunosuke: Shutdown? Susato: ......... Please...I implore you... If we have to voice our goodbyes... ...I won't be able to hold back my tears. Ryunosuke: ......... Susato-san... It truly had been a trying day. On our feet for hours... Getting Gina to open up to us... And learning the truth about that nemesis of a case. Physically and mentally, I was exhausted. And yet the idea of sleep seemed impossible. But I forced myself to close my eyes... ...eventually...my fatigue triumphed, and I fell into a deep sleep. ...................................................... 17th April, the Small Hours St Synner's Hospital, Ward 3 ???: ...Yes, I quite understand. ???: That is a great weight off my mind. Sholmes: Rest assured, I shall put everything in place, exactly as we have discussed. ???: Thank you so much. It has been an honour and a pleasure to be acquainted with you, Mr Sholmes. Sholmes: On the contrary. The pleasure has been mine. I bid you farewell...and Godspeed... ...my dear madam. To be continued...\nNash: We woz walkin' down Baker Street in the small hours, an' the gaff's door was ajar, see?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The front door of Windibank's was ajar, you say? What time of night was this? Nash: Must've been about one. ...Right, Ringo? Ringo: Yeah, I'd say so. ...Right, Sulky? Gregson: How would I know? The place would've been shut at one in the mornin'. Just like every other shop in town. Nash: Well it woz pitch-black inside, it's true. ...Ain't that right, Ringo? Ringo: I'm not so sure, Nash. I seem to remember a little light burnin' inside. Wot about you, Sulky, me old mucker? Gregson: ...Leave me alone. Ryunosuke: (There definitely was a small lamp burning inside. That's what alerted us to the situation in the first place.) Van Zieks: And when these gentlemen ventured into the open establishment... ...the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, already had the muzzle of her gun trained on the unfortunate victim. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That is pure conjecture! Judge: Hmmm... Van Zieks: Hah, perhaps. But it changes nothing. These brothers inadvertently wandered into the middle of a cold-blooded murder... ...simply because they found the door of the victim's establishment open and ventured inside. Nash: Right! That's wot 'appened!Ringo: It woz like some kinda sign. Beggin' for us to go in, it woz!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What are you trying to suggest? That you had to go in? Nash: Well, God moves in mysterious ways, they say, dun't they, Ringo? Ringo: They do, Nash, they do. Must've been some sort o' providence, I reckon. Ryunosuke: ...God's will often presents itself as the whim of thieves, does it? Nash: It weren't no whim. I'm dead sure o' that. Ringo: It weren't, Nash, it weren't. Like we said at the time... Nash: ...Ya don't just find doors open in the middle o' the night like that. Nah, there's no two ways about it... Ringo: ...It woz a sign that our long-lost bruvver was inside! Iris: They're not very good liars, are they? Ringo: Well...ya can't deny it. It led us to a bloke wot looks just like our bruv! Gregson: ...I said, cut it out. Ryunosuke: (Those chips are getting a chomping today...)Nash: But once we got inside, cor blimey lummy! We 'eard a gunshot from the back room!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A gunshot, you say. Just the one. Are you sure about that? Nash: Yup, just the one, guvnor. I can swear to that. Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. ...Ain't that right, Bruv? Gregson: ...The firearm used belonged to the victim himself. Iris: Yes, Mr Windibank always used to leave his gun lying around on the counter. Ryunosuke: Right. I remember. Gregson: When we examined it, we found the revolver was completely out of rounds. Iris: That makes sense. Mr Windibank always used to say he only ever kept a single bullet loaded. Ryunosuke: (That's true. I remember him saying that as well.) Judge: So we can say with considerable certainty... ...that only a single round was discharged from the firearm used as the murder weapon. Gregson: Yes, My Lord. We can. Van Zieks: And I should remind the court... ...that the firearm in question was discovered in the hand of the accused. Judge: Hmmm... Ryunosuke: (...Wonderful.)Ringo: We went to see wot woz wot, but the door was locked from the inside.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you mean the door between the main shop and the storeroom? Van Zieks: If my learned friend is having difficulty grasping the situation, perhaps a drawing would help. Excluding the shop's entrance from the street, there is only one other door. That of the storeroom. Nash: 'Course there woz only a little oil lamp burnin'. Not much to see by. Ringo: An' the door woz 'idden be'ind a curtain an' all. Ryunosuke: (That's right. When we arrived, the door was mostly obscured by the curtain.) Tell me... ...why exactly did you try to open that door? Ringo: Eh? Ryunosuke: Any normal petty thief would run at the sound of a gunshot, I should think. Nash: Oh, well, erm...your turn to rabbit, Ringo. Ringo: Well, Nash, erm...yeah... ...I s'pose...you'd 'ave to say we ain't 'normal', eh? Van Zieks: Broadly speaking, humans respond in one of two ways on hearing a gunshot or scream: The timid flee, gripped by fear, while the courageous investigate to see if they might help. These gentlemen are of the latter inclination. My learned Nipponese friend, it would seem, is of the former. Ryunosuke: (Alright... Somehow I just proved that I was a coward that night...) Judge: Thank you, Counsels... So, I believe we all understand that the door was locked and could not be opened. Proceed, witnesses...Nash: We never done nuffin', guvnor! We never took nuffin'! We just left after that, nice an' quiet.Press Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"You didn't do or take anything...\"Iris: What do you think about this pair, Runo?Ryunosuke: I think they're lying through their teeth, that's what I think. And I'm going to prove it!Iris: .........Ryunosuke: What is it, Iris?Iris: Weeell...I'm not really sure. There's just something a bit funny...about that prosecutor over there.Ryunosuke: Hm? (Wait, could this... ...could this testimony be some sort of a trap?)Ryunosuke: You didn't do or take anything... Is that your story?Nash: Well it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: So with no time to take your hands out of your pockets, you just left, nice and quietly, you say?Nash: That's right, guvnor. Nuffin' we 'ate more than violence. Peace-lovin' nibblers, we are, not bludgers.Ringo: We are, Nash, we are. Never even pulled me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: ...So, you'd clearly like us to believe...Nash: Eh? Come again...?Ryunosuke: As you fled from the pawnbroker's that night... ...did you not run into anyone else?Nash: Um...Ryunosuke: And...did you not fire a gun at that person?!Ringo: Erm...Judge: Saints alive! They fired a gun, you say?Nash: AAAAAAGH!!! Blimey, guvnor!Ringo: You ain't tellin' us it woz you in the doorway?!Ryunosuke: It was.Ringo: ......... Why the bleedin' Nora...Nash: ...Didn't ya mention that before?!Ryunosuke: You were armed with a gun. And as you fled the scene, you fired that gun... ...at London's greatest detective, Herlock Sholmes!They shot the great Mr Sholmes? I did hear that, actually. There was a rumour he'd been rushed to hospital....The great Sholmes? That's beyond the pale!Van Zieks: On the night in question... ...this pair were arrested by the police within minutes of the discovery of the crime scene. ...Their suspicious countenance rapidly gave them away.Ringo: Hehe...Van Zieks: And when searched... ...a firearm was indeed found in their possession.Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Van Zieks: Furthermore, the barrel shows signs of a shot having been fired from it.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Van Zieks: The prosecution invites His Lordship to examine the firearm recovered from these brothers.Judge: Yes, indeed... Remnants of powder around the muzzle, as you say, Counsel.Juror No. 5: ...!Juror No. 6: ...!Judge: The court will hold this weapon as evidence.The Skulkin brothers' gun has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: Now, my learned Nipponese friend...Examine evidence Skulkin Brothers' Gun Bullet cylinder Ryunosuke: So, there's ammunition still loaded in five of this revolver's six cylinders. Iris: Yes, which tell us that only a single shot has been fired from it. Ryunosuke: Exactly. Iris: The bullet that hit Hurley in fact, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes... It happened almost as soon as we'd walked in through Windibank's door. Iris: ......... I'll make those brothers pay.Ryunosuke: Y-Yes?Van Zieks: Here's to you successfully presenting the evidence.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: For yes, there are the telltale signs of spent powder on this gun, and a single bullet missing from the cylinder... ...but the prosecution demands evidence that it was fired at the scene of the crime under scrutiny in this trial!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Well, I don't need evidence! Because I was there!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ...However, the rest of us in this courtroom were not.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: If the defence fails to provide evidence in support of its rash claim... ...we shall have no choice but to toast your incompetence...and move on.Ryunosuke: (Evidence that these two fired that gun before they left Windibank's that night...)Judge: The court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof. What evidence shows that these witnesses unloaded a firearm in the pawnbroker's shop that night?Present Blood Samples Portfolio Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The evidence...is in this portfolio!\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The evidence...is this! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: My learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"The court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof.\"Ryunosuke: The evidence...is in this portfolio!Judge: What, what on earth have you there, Counsel?Ryunosuke: During the course of our investigations, we discovered a number of bloodstains.Van Zieks: ...Not trusting the police to do the job they're trained to do? How arrogantly Nipponese of you.Ryunosuke: W-Well anyway... ...we analysed all the blood samples we found and recorded the results in this portfolio.Judge: And you claim to have the evidence the court is demanding therein?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord.Judge: No more dallying then, Counsel. Present the pertinent evidence at once! What do you have in your portfolio that proves these witnesses unloaded a firearm at the scene?Present Windibank's Main Shop sample Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"What is that? Explain!\"Present any other sample Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: THIS is the blood sample that proves it! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"No more dallying then, Counsel.\"Judge: What is that? Explain!Ryunosuke: It's a photographic print taken at Windibank's pawnbrokery on the day of the incident.Judge: From the scene of the crime, is it? Is, is that... ...a bullet hole? And if my eyes do not deceive me, it appears the bullet is still lodged there.Ryunosuke: Yes, as Your Lordship noticed... ...the bullet pierced Mr Windibank's calendar. The date shown being the 16th of April - the very day of the pawnbroker's death.Judge: The incident occurred at one hour after midnight. But this indicates that a separate shot had been fired sometime after the calendar had been set to the 16th!Ryunosuke: That's right. And while it isn't irrefutable, the defence believes... ...this is credible evidence that the witnesses did fire a round from their gun in the pawnbroker's that night!Nash: NAAAAAAAAAH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! ...How does the prosecution stand, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: ......... If that is the direction my learned friend wishes to take, the prosecution has no objection.Ryunosuke: What?Van Zieks: But you'll forgive me for flinging my hallowed chalice aside in disgust at the repugnancy it exposes. Yes. On the night in question, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery illegally... ...and like the bold 'baddies' they claim to be, opened fire on the new arrivals before fleeing back onto the street!Nash: EEEEEEH?! Take it easy there, guvnor! Yer gonna land us in the soup!Ringo: We 'ad a deal! You weren't gonna get into them...details. Tell 'im, Sulky! Set the bloke straight!Gregson: ...I have nothin' to add.Ryunosuke: (So he knew, did he? Van Zieks knew their testimony would almost certainly expose the extent of their crimes.)Van Zieks: It would seem now... ...that I owe my learned Nipponese friend a word of gratitude.Ryunosuke: What do you mean?Van Zieks: What I mean...is that you have helpfully confirmed an important fact.Judge: To what fact do you refer, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: As has been established, at the point of their arrest, a single shot had been fired from the brothers' gun. However, if that shot found its target in Mr Sholmes... ...then clearly these witnesses cannot be accused of the fatal shooting of the proprietor and victim.Ryunosuke: Agh!Van Zieks: In other words...these two men... ...have no material connection to the murder of Mr Windibank at all!Ryunosuke: ...! (So that's it...)Nash: That's it! We didn't 'ave nuffin' to do wiv it!Ringo: We didn't, Nash, we didn't! That's wot I reckon!Van Zieks: Your crimes include unlawful entry, intent to steal, perjury and - let us not forget - attempted murder.Gregson: Quite a catalogue, eh, fellas?Nash: Ah...Ringo: We're in for it now, bruv...Van Zieks: Now then... ...let us take a moment to consider the aforementioned 'great detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes. It would seem the man patronised the pawnbroker's in question somewhat regularly.Ryunosuke: (Where's he going with this?)Van Zieks: Mr Sholmes appears to take pleasure in tinkering with eccentric machinery.Iris: 'Eccentric'? Says who?!Ryunosuke: ...Not me. Don't give me that look!Van Zieks: He installed a pair of machines like this one in the victim's shop.Iris: Oh! That's one of Hurley's 'Red-Handed Recorders'!Judge: What is that, Counsel? It has the appearance of a photographic contraption.Van Zieks: As Your Lordship has surmised, it is indeed a camera attached to a small timing device.Ryunosuke: Every half an hour, it automatically photographs the interior of the establishment. The idea being that if a thief were to break in to the shop, he would be caught red-handed.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: The prosecution has obtained the photographs taken by the device on the night in question. As the court will observe, copious identical prints are produced in a quite desultory fashion.Judge: Hmph, rather prodigal, I feel.Van Zieks: In fact there are two such devices in the victim's shop, My Lord. If I may refer the court to the plan of the premises, their respective positions are here...and here.Judge: You say these cameras produce a print every half hour. I'm afraid I fail to see... ...how that would help if the anticipated thief conducted his activities in one of the many thirty-minute intervals.Van Zieks: One can only pray that the would-be criminal lingers, My Lord.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: On the night in question, the witnesses currently in the stand were not caught on camera.Nash: Hehe, that's a bit o' Friar Tuck, eh, bruv?Ringo: Lady Luck luvs a Skulkin!Judge: Witnesses, at what time did your trespassing begin?Nash: Eh? ...Must've been just after one. ...Right, bruv?Ringo: Must've been, Nash, must've been. Yeah, just gone one.Van Zieks: In which case, minutes before these brothers entered the establishment... ...what scene might we expect to see within the shop? Let us examine the evidence...Judge: Good Lord! It's...it's the defendant! Miss Gina Lestrade!Van Zieks: As the court can clearly see... ...the accused is pictured, gun in hand, facing the victim over the shop counter. No doubt coercing the proprietor to open the door to his storeroom.Judge: Quite! One can only too easily imagine the events that unfolded. The court will take this photographic print as evidence, if you please, Counsel.The photograph of Gina has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke: Ugh...Iris: I, I don't believe it! Ginny...Van Zieks: In short... ...the accused is the only person who could possibly have killed Mr Windibank.Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!???:I say, My Lord...Juror No. 1: Wonder if I might put in a word at this point.Judge: Go ahead, Mr Foreman.Juror No. 1: Took a bally bullet to the knee in the Battle of Maiwand, 1880, don't you know. Decorated for it and all that, but forced to retire from service, sadly. 'Course, a medal can never outshine the exploits of chaps like us on the battlefield.Judge: Yes, Mr Foreman, and...? What exactly is your point?Juror No. 1: Carried on the battle after retirement, you see. The battle of daily life, if you like. And here I am now, leading this small squadron. Six men, all good and true. And we'll all go down together, you mark my words! One for all...and all for one!Van Zieks: ...The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have reached agreement, have they? Is that what we are to understand?Judge: Well, Mr Foreman? Is that correct?Juror No. 1: ......... In a manner of speaking...yes. That is the Garrideb Squadron's position, sir!Ryunosuke: What?! No! It's too soon to make a judgement here!Juror No. 1: Status report for the court, men! On the double!Juror No. 2: His Lordship insists on promptitude at all times. And that goes for making decisions, too.Juror No. 3: I think you'll find the truth is as clear as day now! I could reach out and touch it!Juror No. 4: I wouldn't have left it in there. I just wouldn't. But in all honesty, I can't actually remember...Juror No. 5: Situation clear. Stop. No room for doubt. Stop. Truth now undeniable. Stop.Juror No. 6: I am wery sorry for brothers. They are unlucky.Judge: Very well... ...I now call upon each member of the jury to state his or her leaning in this matter. Announce your considered verdicts to the court!Juror No. 1: Guilty!Juror No. 2: Guilty!Juror No. 3: Guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Guilty!Judge: It does indeed appear that the jury is unanimous in its leaning already.Ryunosuke: (That photograph... It must be the definitive evidence that Gregson mentioned!)Iris: But Ginny didn't shoot him!Ryunosuke: No, of course not! My Lord! The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination!Judge: Very well. The court grants permission.Van Zieks: So...you refuse to admit defeat again. How...unsurprising.Judge: We shall proceed immediately with the summation examination. Mr Foreman, are all members of the jury ready?Juror No. 1: Abso-bally-lutely, sir! Always ready for action, my chaps!Judge: ...Very good. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have determined the defendant to be guilty!Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1: All the evidence clearly points the finger of guilt at this young pickpocketienne.Juror No. 2: As a housemaid, I should like to see all filthy eyesores promptly and rigorously eliminated.Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you look at that photograph in stereo, the truth will just pop out.Juror No. 4: If I have left it in there, I should think there'll be repercussions by now...Juror No. 5: Mind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.Juror No. 6: In motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.Judge: Hmmm... The circumstance of the crime and the evidence do indeed implicate the defendant rather comprehensively.Van Zieks: The storeroom, locked from the inside, in which the victim and the accused were discovered alone. And in the accused's hand, the fatal revolver, the firing of which was heard by these witnesses.Juror No. 1: Not to mention this print! Take it from a chap whose [sic] seen action on the battlefield: That young girl's on the verge of pulling the bally trigger!Ryunosuke: (...Thanks a lot, Mr Sholmes.)Iris: Oh dear... Hurley's cameras were supposed to help, not hinder.Judge: I'm afraid I think you have an uphill struggle ahead of you.Ryunosuke: (But Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank. Which means there's more to this situation that we've yet to see.)Iris: Agreed!Judge: You have the floor, Counsel. Proceed with the summation examination!Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1: All the evidence clearly points the finger of guilt at this young pickpocketienne.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You're Mr Natsume's landlord, Mr Garrideb...aren't you? We really must stop meeting like this. Juror No. 1: ......... Ah, you're that lawyer chap. Well, there's a turn-up for the books! Yes, rather a turbulent time we had back then. Ryunosuke: Some extraordinary events took place at your house, that's for sure. Luckily Mr Sholmes and I were able to get to the bottom of it all. Juror No. 1: ...! Ryunosuke: I think we did rather a lot for you, didn't we? Juror No. 1: ......... Ryunosuke: I mean, obviously... ...I wouldn't be suggesting that therefore you should change your leaning to not guilty or anything! Juror No. 1: ......... Hmph. Can't be denied, I suppose. The 'curse of the Garrideb house' was the talk of the town after that business. Lodgers moved out, and I couldn't get a bally soul to take up the tenancies. Ryunosuke: Oh. Juror No. 1: Haven't had the heart to break the news to Joanie yet. Bad enough that the old girl's clapped up. Yes, can't be denied...you did do rather a lot. But not for us, that's for dashed certain. Ryunosuke: I suppose not... Juror No. 1: 'Course... ...there can be no suggestion of that being the reason I'm leaning towards guilty here, obviously. Ryunosuke: (...Obviously. But honestly... ...I really wish he'd pay more attention to the trial, and less to juror number two.)Juror No. 2: As a housemaid, I should like to see all filthy eyesores promptly and rigorously eliminated.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...Polishing the bench, I see...again. Juror No. 2: A maid's work is never done. Not a blemish must remain. Ryunosuke: Um, what exactly do you mean by 'filthy eyesores'? Juror No. 2: On my way to market for His Lordship, I have to pass through the East End. The place is full of beggars, pickpurses and crossmen. The scum of the earth! Ryunosuke: ...A little harsh, perhaps. Juror No. 2: Let me be plain... If it were up to me, all those back slums would be made spick and span or eradicated. At least we have people like the great detective working to achieve these important goals. Ryunosuke: You're referring to Mr Herlock Sholmes? Juror No. 2: That's right. I like to keep abreast of his exploits by reading Randst Magazine in between my duties. He does wonders, cleaning up London's streets. In my opinion, he should be declared an honorary maid of the capital. Ryunosuke: ...Mr Sholmes? ...A maid? Juror No. 2: It's really quite unforgivable... Gutter scum having the audacity to shoot our very greatest detective! Ryunosuke: ......... Minor detail: It was the two brothers in the stand who shot Mr Sholmes, not the defendant. Juror No. 2: A minor detail indeed. They're all gutter scum as far as I'm concerned! Ryunosuke: Weeell...it just might be an idea to get our facts straight anyway... Juror No. 2: ...Yes, alright. I shall amend my statement. Changes Juror No. 2's statement to \"Those brothers are the scum of the earth! They should swing for shooting the great detective!\"Juror No. 2: Those brothers are the scum of the earth! They should swing for shooting the great detective!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I agree with you. The shooting of Mr Sholmes was an unforgivable act. But the purpose of this trial is to determine who shot the pawnbroker, Mr Windibank. Juror No. 2: ...I'm afraid you're splitting hairs, sir. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Juror No. 2: Whether it was the thieves or the pickpurse... ...it was still gutter trash that shot the pawnbroker in the end. Filth that should be cleaned up and eradicated...in my considered opinion. Ryunosuke: (Thanks so much for sharing. ...Changing this maid's mind isn't going to be easy.) Iris: Runo... ...it was one of those two brothers that shot Hurley, wasn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes. Without question. Iris: Well then I'll never forgive them! Ryunosuke: Oh, Iris... Iris: Perhaps we can use this maid's statement to help us somehow, do you think? Ryunosuke: Yes, maybe. Let's listen carefully to what each juror has to say first...Pit against Juror No. 6's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself! Juror No.2: Oh my! My statement? Contradictory? Juror No. 6: Contradict... C-o-n... Ryunosuke: Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick. Juror No. 6: ...I do not have stick. I have mouse. Ryunosuke: As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver. Juror No. 2: Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand! Ryunosuke: ...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d... Ryunosuke: ...Sir? Juror No. 6: Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning. Ryunosuke: ...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Forgive me. I did not hear. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 6: ...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker. Ryunosuke: (...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!) Juror No. 6: So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative. Ryunosuke: Yes! That's exactly right! Juror No. 6: Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal! Ryunosuke: ...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced. Juror No. 6: This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?! Ryunosuke: Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so... Juror No. 6: Enough! I trust no one now! Ryunosuke: ...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir. Juror No. 6: I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself! Ryunosuke: I'm afraid that won't be poss- Iris: Yes it is, Runo! Easily! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder! Ryunosuke: Ah... Iris: If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor! Van Zieks: Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight. Iris: So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken. Ryunosuke: (That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.) Juror No. 6: So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing. Ryunosuke: It would seem so, yes. Juror No. 6: Good. Ryunosuke: No, not good. Juror No. 6: You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial. Iris: Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting! Ryunosuke: Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still! Judge: Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence. The post-shooting photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: (Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...) Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.\"Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you look at that photograph in stereo, the truth will just pop out.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you mean, 'look at the photograph in stereo'? Juror No. 3: Sorry? What? Don't, don't you know? If you look at the photographic print normally... ...it looks as though the pickpocket girl is about to shoot the victim, obviously. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But there's no indication that the defendant ever fired the gun! Juror No. 3: All I'm saying is that if you look at the same print in stereo, it could reveal all sorts of new information. Ryunosuke: ......... By any chance... ...are you a fan of stereoscopes? Juror No. 3: Ooooooh! How did you know?! Ryunosuke: ...Let's call it a lucky guess. Juror No. 3: It never gets old, seeing the two prints merge into one before your eyes! It's extraordinary! It's captivating! It's the height of modernity! Ryunosuke: ...Of course. Juror No. 3: Oh yes! I think you'll find that the stereoscope is here to stay! Giving us new perspectives we could only dream of before, it's the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Ryunosuke: (...If only it could give me a new perspective on this case, I might agree with you.)Juror No. 3: All we'd need is another shot from a slightly different location, and we could see the scene in three dimensions!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Can it really show up new clues, though? Juror No. 3: Don't know unless you try! Ryunosuke: How about this print here? It should do the trick, I think. Present Photograph of Gina or Post-Shooting Photograph Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Alright then, juror number three... ...are you saying you can do this with any two suitable photographic prints? Juror No. 3: Of course I can! Ryunosuke: Very well then...I'd like you to demonstrate. Juror No. 3: I'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all! Present Post-Shooting Photograph or Photograph of Gina (whichever has not been presented yet) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Wait, sorry? What do you mean, one more print? Juror No. 3: Oh dear, oh dear... Don't you have these in the Far East? Don't you know how a stereoscope works? Iris: Runo! Ryunosuke: What? Iris: You need two photographs for a stereoscope, remember? You know, one for the left eye, and one for the right. Ryunosuke: Oh, oh yes. I remember now. But the print we have from the pawnbrokery is just a normal photograph. Juror No. 3: No no no. I think you'll find... ...that the clue is in the name. It's a stereoscope, not a monoscope! You always need two prints! Ryunosuke: (...Thanks for the friendly explanation.) Iris: Hmmm... Well, if we obtain another print at some point later in the trial... ...we can always show it to this young man then. Juror No. 3: Hahaha! Ryunosuke: (I think you'll find...that know-it-all expression is really starting to annoy me.) Judge: Let's get things back on track, shall we, Counsel? Leads back to summation examination Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Ugh...I was wrong. I can't actually think of anything we could use at all. Iris: What? Really? Oh dear, I think maybe I need to have a stereoscopic look at your brain sometime. Ryunosuke: (...What's that supposed to mean?) Leads back to summation examinationJuror No. 4: If I have left it in there, I should think there'll be repercussions by now...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um, what exactly have you been muttering about all this time, sir? You keep talking about having left something somewhere or something like that. Juror No. 4: Ah...so sorry. As you can probably tell, I'm a surgeon. Ryunosuke: A surgeon?! (That totally passed me by...) Juror No. 4: Of course, people conducting surgery in this country aren't considered to be doctors. Oh no! Even though me and my kind are at the forefront of medical science! The real brains in the field! Ryunosuke: So...what is it that you think you've left behind? Juror No. 4: Ah well, that's...a little embarrassing, to be honest. You see I was operating on someone yesterday. Standard thing - went in through the abdomen. But when I'd finished the procedure, I... Well, I couldn't find my scalpel anywhere. Ryunosuke: What?! (Did he...? Surely not!) Juror No. 4: Exactly! 'Surely not!' you say to yourself, don't you? Worrying, isn't it? That's what's been troubling me this whole time. Could I really have left my scalpel inside the fellow's belly? ...No, of course I couldn't! So...there you have it. Like I said, a little embarrassing, really. Ryunosuke: ...That's one way of putting it. The other is manslaughter. Juror No. 4: That's exactly my concern! And seeing as this case appears to be all but sewn up... ...I need to focus on trying to remember exactly what I've sewn up elsewhere! Now...I'm sure I made sure everything was back as it should be. Well, as sure as you can be without being sure. Ryunosuke: (...I'm sure you need to be more sure.)Juror No. 5: Mind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Sorry, 'radio transmission'? What do you mean? Juror No. 5: ...Are you from the Far East? Stop. Ryunosuke: Um, yes. From the Empire of Japan. Juror No. 5: All communication with Far Eastern nations used to take place by mail. Royal Mail steamers take more than a month to complete the journey. Iris: Ah, but now we have the electric telegram. So we can send messages using electrical signals. Thousands of miles of cables have been laid along the ocean beds, connecting the entire world. Ryunosuke: Thousands of miles of cable? ...On the ocean bed? (It makes my head hurt just thinking about it.) Juror No. 5: You are well informed, young lady. Iris: Hehe! Juror No. 5: But cables will soon become a thing of the past. Stop. Ryunosuke: ...And just when I was starting to catch up. Juror No. 5: Radio transmission is the future. Stop. Messages carried over airwaves to four corners of globe. Stop. Excitement growing! Stop. Atmosphere electric! Stop. Ryunosuke: Right... (...Try not to wear out your fingers.) Juror No. 5: Era of wireless telegraphy! Stop. Driving technological revolution! Stop. And people say inventions like the stereoscope are the height of technology! What utter piffle! I can't understand it. I really can't. They're just silly toys! Pursue Juror No. 3 Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Erm, juror number three...sorry to interrupt when you're obviously fuming, but... Juror No. 3: What?! Ryunosuke: Do you perhaps have something to say about juror number five's last remark? ...As if I couldn't guess. Juror No. 3: Oh, you bet I do! Say that again! Go on! I dare you! Juror No. 5: Goodness! Are you talking to me? Ryunosuke: ...I think he just might be, yes. Juror No. 3: You think stereoscopes are just toys, do you? Huh? Juror No. 5: Absolutely. I mean, really! A machine to view photographs in three dimensions? Why on earth would you not just use your eyes to look at the world around you? It's all three-dimensional! Ryunosuke: ...What a great way to appease the man. Juror No. 5: No, I'm sorry. Stereoscopes are of no practical use at all. Juror No. 3: ......... You just don't know! Juror No. 5: Pardon? Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that viewing a photograph through a stereoscope... ...can unlock all sorts of possibilities! I'm obviously going to have to demonstrate! Ryunosuke: What sort of possibilities? Juror No. 3: Well, take a crime scene, for example. If you had a pair of photographs from a crime scene that you could view through a stereoscope... ...it could reveal hidden clues you'd never even noticed before! Ryunosuke: What?! Iris: Have you got any, Runo? Any prints we could look at with a stereoscope? Absolutely! Ryunosuke: How about this print here? It should do the trick, I think. Present Photograph of Gina or Post-Shooting Photograph Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Alright then, juror number three... ...are you saying you can do this with any two suitable photographic prints? Juror No. 3: Of course I can! Ryunosuke: Very well then...I'd like you to demonstrate. Juror No. 3: I'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all!

I can't actually think of anything we could use at all. Iris: What? Really? Oh dear, I think maybe I need to have a stereoscopic look at your brain sometime. Ryunosuke: (...What's that supposed to mean?) Leads back to summation examination None spring to mind Ryunosuke: Ugh...no, I don't think so. None spring to mind, anyway. Iris: Well if you find any, we should definitely try it! Ryunosuke: ...I don't think we're just going to find prints of the crime scene lying around, you know. (But I suppose if we somehow find ourselves with some, it would be worth a go...) Leads back to summation examination Ryunosuke: ...Don't spare any feelings, will you? It's not like there's anyone here who likes stereoscopes... So...why exactly do you think that the defendant is guilty? Juror No. 5: It's quite simple... We haven't been shown a scrap of evidence to suggest that she isn't the culprit. And just as radio waves dash through the skies faster than the eye can see... ...so we should dash to the conclusion of this trial, and stop pandering to in-dit-cision!Juror No. 6: In motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Please tell me you're not Vilen Borshevik... ...the Russian revolutionary. Juror No. 5: Re-Revolutionary?! Juror No. 6: ......... Da. I believe there is such a rumour. Ryunosuke: ...It's just a rumour? Juror No. 6: As you see, I have unfortunate appearance. I look like wicious criminal. Ryunosuke: (...Your words, not mine. Just want to point that out.) Juror No. 6: People call me revolutionary...murderer...autocrat... Juror No. 5: And...which glove fits? Juror No. 6: 'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.' Juror No. 5: ......... Ryunosuke: (Right. That didn't sound staged at all. You'll forgive me for having my doubts.) Juror No. 6: To be treated like wicious criminal all the time... It is wery painful. People do not realise. So I have much sympathies for these brothers. People say they are criminals only because of how they look. Ryunosuke: The Skulkin brothers? Juror No. 6: Da, maybe they went inside pawnbroker's shop. But they have done nothing wrong. That is all what I want to say! Ryunosuke: ...The Skulkin brothers did nothing wrong that night? (Alright, well first of all... ...that's one not-so-little misunderstanding I'll need to clear up straight away.) Tell me something, Iris... Iris: Hm? What is it, Runo? Ryunosuke: The jurors are chosen at random from the inhabitants of London town, aren't they? Iris: Yes! It's amazing, isn't it? Ryunosuke: In that case... ...how is it that there's a Russian tourist sitting among them, who looks for all the world like a revolutionary? Iris: ...I wish I knew.Pit against Juror No. 2's statement (after Juror No. 2 changes her statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself! Juror No.2: Oh my! My statement? Contradictory? Juror No. 6: Contradict... C-o-n... Ryunosuke: Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick. Juror No. 6: ...I do not have stick. I have mouse. Ryunosuke: As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver. Juror No. 2: Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand! Ryunosuke: ...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d... Ryunosuke: ...Sir? Juror No. 6: Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning. Ryunosuke: ...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Forgive me. I did not hear. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 6: ...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker. Ryunosuke: (...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!) Juror No. 6: So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative. Ryunosuke: Yes! That's exactly right! Juror No. 6: Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal! Ryunosuke: ...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced. Juror No. 6: This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?! Ryunosuke: Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so... Juror No. 6: Enough! I trust no one now! Ryunosuke: ...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir. Juror No. 6: I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself! Ryunosuke: I'm afraid that won't be poss- Iris: Yes it is, Runo! Easily! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder! Ryunosuke: Ah... Iris: If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor! Van Zieks: Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight. Iris: So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken. Ryunosuke: (That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.) Juror No. 6: So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing. Ryunosuke: It would seem so, yes. Juror No. 6: Good. Ryunosuke: No, not good. Juror No. 6: You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial. Iris: Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting! Ryunosuke: Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still! Judge: Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence. The post-shooting photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: (Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...) Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.\"Juror No. 6: In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.Ryunosuke: (If I can't change the minds of more than half of these six jurors... ...the trial will be over.)Iris: But we know that Ginny would never shoot anyone.Ryunosuke: Yes, so we need to find contradictions in what these jurors are saying and pit them against each other. (I must be ready to go to whatever lengths I have to... to convince them of Gina's innocence!)Ryunosuke: Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.Juror No. 3: Yes, I see. Tell me, Mr, um...lawyer. Do you know how stereographic images work? Do you understand the principle?Ryunosuke: Well...I think so... (I did have a lesson only yesterday...) The left and right eye images need to be the same, only with a slight shift in the positions of some objects. Then when your brain merges the two images together inside your head, it notices the shift as if it were depth.Juror No. 3: Yes, exactly.Iris: It's that small shift between certain objects in the two pictures that's really important.Ryunosuke: So what happens if you use two photographs that are exactly the same, then?Juror No. 3: No no, obviously that wouldn't work at all. Not for seeing the scene three-dimensionally, anyway.Iris: Oh... OOOOOOH! Of course! Now I see!Juror No. 3: Ah! I think the young girl has discovered the secret!Iris: I have, I have!Ryunosuke: ...Can you uncross your eyes before you tell me?Iris: Have another look at these two pictures from Hurley's camera, Runo! Go on! Can you see that there's a really obvious difference between them?Ryunosuke: Of course there is! There are two people in the first, and no people in the second!Iris: Well yes, you can see that straight away. But now... ...try looking at the pictures in three dimensions!Ryunosuke: Alright, I'll, I'll give it a go. (So, to start with... ...you have to cross your eyes, and then try to make the two pictures overlap exactly.) ........................... (Let's see if by crossing my eyes I can make the quill pens from each picture overlap in the middle...) ........................... (...Wait...)Iris: Well? Did you manage to see it properly, Runo?Not really... Ryunosuke: I'm just not very good at this, that's the trouble. Iris: Oh, don't worry. I have just the thing! I happened to bring with me...a portable stereoscope! Ryunosuke: ......... I know I mentioned this yesterday, but if you've had that contraption with you from the outset... ...you could have saved me staring at Mr Windibank and Gina like I hate them all that time! Iris: And if you remember, I said in reply... ...that it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Anyway, why don't we try using this helpful little aid now? Here goes... Ryunosuke: ........................... (Now, let's see what we've got... ...Wait! Look at that!)  Leads to: \"Agh!\"Yes, I saw it! Leads to: \"Agh!\"Ryunosuke: Agh! What's, what's going on with these two pictures? Some of the things on the counter sort of... They sort of jump out at you!Juror No. 3: Yes yes yes! That's it, you see! That's the other amazing power of stereoscopes!Ryunosuke: O-Other amazing power?!Juror No. 1: Is someone going to explain this...black magic, eh? Why the deuce do some of the things on the counter seem to jump out at you like that, hm?Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you consider the basic principle of the stereoscope, you'll answer your own question.Juror No. 5: Basic principles...of the stereoscope...?Juror No. 3: As I said before... ...if you try to look at two identical pictures using a stereoscope, it won't work at all. It's the slight shift in the positions of certain objects that lets you see pictures three-dimensionally.Ryunosuke: ...In other words... ...even though at first glance it seems the objects on the counter haven't moved at all between the two pictures... ...this shows that actually...there must have been a slight shift in their positions!Iris: Yes, there must have been.Juror No. 1: Now hold fire there, sir! Got a reasonable grasp of this whole cross-eyed business now, I'd say. But why the devil does this shift between the two prints exist in the first place? Well? What's the answer, fellow? Come on, you're the cross-eyed master!Ryunosuke: What? Me? (I haven't the first idea!)Iris: You know, Runo! It's quite simple.Ryunosuke: It, it is?Iris: Just think it through step by step. The first photograph was taken at 1:00 a.m. Then, thirty minutes later...the second photograph was taken. But the position of some items on the counter appears to have shifted slightly in the interim. So that means...?Ryunosuke: That means that sometime in the half hour interval... ...someone must have tampered with the things on the counter!Juror No. 1: Zookers!Juror No. 3: Someone tampered...?Juror No. 5: New information! Stop. Not mentioned in testimony so far! Stop.Ryunosuke: (Yes... ...we've had to go around in circles a little here, it seems... ...but I'm starting to see what I should be aiming at in this summation examination now.) Ladies and gentlemen! The question now is clear. We know the items on the countertop were moved. ...But by whom?Juror No. 1: Are you... Are you suggesting you might know?Ryunosuke: Of course. I can tell you right now who is responsible for the almost imperceptible shift in the items on the counter!Present Nash Skulkin or Ringo Skulkin profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Quite clearly it was the work...of this meddler! Judge: Hm... I'm afraid you've digressed there, Counsel. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: It should now be clear even to you... ...who is responsible for the impeachable shift in the direction of this trial...toward the absurd. Ryunosuke: Let me guess... ...Me? Van Zieks: Shift aside, my Nipponese friend, and let the real lawyers do the talking! Ryunosuke: Uargh! (I really felt that one...) Iris: If you think about it... ...it has to have been someone who was in Windibank's when everything was going on, doesn't it? Ryunosuke: Well...yes, that's true. Iris: So... ...that narrows it down quite a lot, I think. Ryunosuke: I'll have another think! (We know somebody must have touched the things on Mr Windibank's counter. So who was it?) Leads back to: \"Ladies and gentlemen!\"Ryunosuke: It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!Juror No. 2: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Juror No. 6: Wait! This does not agree with what brothers said in testimony before. They said they did not even have time to pull 'dukes' from 'Lucy Lockets'. My phrasebook says 'dukes' is meaning 'hands' and 'Lucy Lockets' is meaning 'pockets'. But is this...another lie?! Is this what you are saying?!Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm afraid so.Juror No. 4: Now hold on there a minute! You can't be sure of that.Juror No. 2: I quite agree. The accused is a common pickpurse, after all. It's perfectly possible that she went through the things on the desk to see what she might steal.Ryunosuke: I think...that's unlikely.Juror No. 1: And why, exactly?Ryunosuke: ...As you can see from...this photographic print, the defendant was pointing a gun at the victim. It would seem, as my learned friend indicated, that she was coercing Mr Windibank to open the storeroom door. In other words, Miss Lestrade's interests lay within the storeroom, not in the main shop... ...giving her no reason to touch anything on the counter. All of which points to one thing! The Skulkin brothers have omitted key facts in their testimony!Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...! But the accused is a pickpurse! Common gutter trash! Why look any further for the wrongdoer here?Ryunosuke: Because the Skulkin brothers are thieves, madam. No better - in fact worse - than a pickpurse.Juror No. 2: ...!Ryunosuke: I believe that these brothers were looking for something on the victim's counter that night.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Ryunosuke: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you would condemn the defendant on the grounds that she's a pickpocket... ...would it not at least be right and proper to thoroughly scrutinise testimony given against her by two thieves?Juror No. 4: ...Well said.Ryunosuke: ...!Juror No. 4: I for one would like to hear more from that shady pair!Juror No. 3: Can you all see now? I think you'll find stereoscopes aren't playthings! You've seen their extraordinary potential firsthand!Juror No. 5: Wholeheartedly agree! Stop. Must purchase after trial. Stop. Will return home via Regent Street. Stop.Judge: Well...it would seem this trial has yet to run its course. The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have declared their inclinations via the mighty Scales of Justice. I hereby call this summation examination to conclusion with the balance altered in the defendant's favour. Two lean to guilty. Four lean to not guilty. Accordingly, the jury is without consensus... ...and I order this trial to continue.Iris: Yay! Well done! ...Oh, by the way...Ryunosuke: What?Iris: You should hold onto this, Runo. You never know when it might come in useful!Ryunosuke: (Twice in one trial would be unusual, surely? But alright.)The stereoscope has been entered into the Court Record.Judge: Lord van Zieks... ...you will instruct the witnesses that the court demands additional testimony from them.Examine evidence Stereoscope Print tray Iris: You have to pop your two prints in here to start with, you see. Ryunosuke: And then, when you look through the eyepieces, you can see the image in three dimensions! Iris: The important thing to get right is the position of the two prints. Ryunosuke: (I don't know who came up with the idea of a stereoscope, but it's really quite fascinating.) Button Ryunosuke: Ooh! Look at that! It's totally changed shape, just from one little button press! Iris: Well, that is what the button's for, Runo. You're just like Hurley. You boys love pressing buttons, don't you, especially if you don't know what they do! Ryunosuke: (Us boys? ...Says the ten-year-old girl.) Iris: Anyway, now you can see that it really is a stereoscope, can't you?Van Zieks: ......... I'm sure it won't spoil the bouquet to do so...My Lord.Ryunosuke: (I've won myself another chance to probe that pair about their activities that night at least. And I won't stop probing them until I've proven that Gina is innocent!)To be continued...Judge: Order, please. Let us resume proceedings. Witnesses! You will now retake the stand.Judge: I presume you heard the defence counsel's summation examination?Nash: Oh...yeah...guvnor.Ringo: I did, guv, I did.Ryunosuke: ...Mr and Mr Skulkin!Cor!Blimey!Ryunosuke: (...This is going to be hard work.) Earlier in this trial, you gave the following testimony about your actions after you entered Windibank's...Nash: Well it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: However...that was a lie! You brothers!Cor!Blimey!Ryunosuke: On the night in question... ...you rifled through the items on the victim's counter!We never done nuffin' o' the sort!'Ow d'you figure that out?.........Judge: You will now give formal testimony once again. You will tell the court precisely what happened on the night in question. And this time...you will tell the truth.Van Zieks: ...Each lie that passes your lips serves to increase the severity of your punishment. And that, gentlemen, may deal a crushing blow to your chances of ever seeing the light of day again....!...!Van Zieks: A thought worth pondering perhaps.Say no more, guv! We 'ear ya!We'll blab! We'll speak! We'll peach!Witness Testimony - Illegal Entry: The Whole Truth -Nash: Alright, we did knock a few things over. But we weren't riflin' fer nuffin'!Ringo: It woz when we 'eard the gunshot, see. Made us both jump, an' all that stuff went flyin'.Nash: Lummy, it didn't 'alf gimme a fright! We woz thinkin' the shooter'd come out the door and get us next.Ringo: We stuck everyfin' back where we found it and scarpered...straight into 'im in the black.Nash: We couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?Judge: Hmmm...so you admit to the defence's accusation. You did indeed ransack Mr Windibank's countertop on the night in question.Nash: Err...not ransack, guvnor, no.Ringo: That's right, Nash, that's right. It's...more like we tidied up. Yeah.Van Zieks: .........Ringo: Ugh...sorry.Van Zieks: By their own admission, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery under dubious circumstances. However, they panicked and fled on hearing the gunshot, having first made good their mess.Nash: The way you say it...we 'ardly sound like roughs at all.Ringo: We don't, Nash, we don't. Can't 'e make us sound a bit more...cut-throat?Ryunosuke: (It can't just be coincidence that these men showed up at Windibank's that night. There's more to their testimony than meets the eye. I'm sure of it!)Cross-Examination - Illegal Entry: The Whole Truth -Ringo: Alright, so we'd just got inside the gaff and 'eaved a sigh o' relief when the geezer showed 'is mug!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say 'geezer', I presume you mean the victim and proprietor of the shop, Mr Windibank? Ringo: Who else- ...Sorry, I mean, that's right! Nash: We woz keepin' a close eye on the entrance to the gaff, obviously. But we never thought no one woz gonna come outta the back room like that! Ryunosuke: The back room being the pawnbrokery's storeroom? Ringo: Yeah, that must be where 'e popped up from. Only place 'e could've been. Van Zieks: So it would seem the victim was already in the storeroom when these brothers entered the premises. Iris: Which means...Ginny must have been in there at that point as well. Ryunosuke: But that doesn't make sense...does it? If Gina had threatened Mr Windibank into the storeroom with her at gunpoint... ...then why would he have emerged from the same room all alone when the brothers arrived? Iris: Oh, I...don't know... Ryunosuke: Did you see the accused at that time? Ringo: Wot, that moll-tooler? Couldn't tell ya! Nash: No way, cobber! We 'ad bigger fish to fry then! I mean the old geezer just lost it!Nash: 'Gimme that gun!' 'e bellowed, and then 'e flew at us like 'e woz possessed! I thought we'd 'ad it!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You mentioned that Mr Windibank shouted those words in your previous testimony, too. However, you claimed that you heard him yelling them on the other side of the storeroom door. Nash: Oh...um... Hehe. ...Did we? Ryunosuke: But the truth is, he he was shouting those words at you, wasn't he? Nash: Erm...well... Hehe. ...Yeah. Van Zieks: Was the victim - Mr Windibank - wielding a gun at the time? Ringo: Woz 'e ever! Blimey lummy! A great ugly barrel 'e 'ad, pointed straight at me frontispiece! Ryunosuke: So what you're saying is... ...you definitely saw Mr Windibank with the gun at that time. Is that right? Ringo: It is, guv, it is. Spot on. Nash: Then all of a sudden 'e came at us, 'e did! Ringo: It woz bedlam! I didn't know who woz goin' for who! Ryunosuke: ...You were clearly all going for each other. Ringo: Like Nash said, we thought we'd 'ad it. I mean...Ringo: For an old geezer, the bloke woz strong as an ox. 'E chucked me over the counter!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Yes, I noted that you mentioned the counter in your previous testimony, too. Ringo: Well...yeah...'course we did! Nash: 'E knocked over a load o' books, a candlestick and some skull wotnot. Ringo: That got tangled in some marionette, wot knocked over a picture frame, wot knocked them scales on the floor. Ryunosuke: So in fact, it wasn't the sound of the gunshot that shocked you and made you knock those things off the counter? Nash: Well...'big' bruv 'ere went flyin' over that counter like a gunshot, I can tell ya! Then the old geezer pinned 'im! Ringo: 'E did, Nash, 'e did! If you 'adn't been there, the bloke would've flattened me like a bloomin' pancake in seconds! Van Zieks: At the time in question, the alarm was raised at the local police station via a secret cable from the pawnbrokery. There is a button under the counter used to activate it, which was presumably pressed by the victim. Ryunosuke: (That's right... When the brothers fled the scene and back onto the street... ...they ran straight into the arriving police, didn't they?) Iris: Poor Mr Windibank... He did everything he could to protect his shop...Nash: I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Were you intending to shoot Mr Windibank? Nash: Nah nah nah nah! Never! I, I woz just...ya know... Lookin' out fer me bruv, weren't I? 'E woz bein' flattened, don't forget! Ryunosuke: ...By a man whose shop was being burgled, yes. Van Zieks: And then? The man fled into the storeroom when you pointed your gun at him, is that it? Nash: Yeah, that's it. 'E shoved me away, then ran off fru that door an' shut 'imself in! Ryunosuke: ......... (There's something about that last remark... Something that doesn't quite ring true.) Iris: Hm...I wonder why Mr Windibank ran away into the storeroom... Ryunosuke: What? Iris: Well, according to what everyone's saying... ...Ginny was in there waiting for him...with a gun. Ryunosuke: Ah... (Yes, that's right.) Gina allegedly used Mr Windibank's gun to threaten him and force him to open the storeroom door. In which case...how did the gun end up in Mr Windibank's hands again? Iris: I have no idea... But that is strange, isn't it? Ryunosuke: (This little inconsistency could be significant. I should make a mental note of it.) Nash: Look, the point is, me an' me bruv 'ere... Ringo: That's right, Nash, that's right! Me an' me bruv 'ere...Ringo: We never 'ad nuffin' to do wiv killin' 'im! That's all wot 'appened, I swear!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You say you had nothing to do with it? Nash: Nuffin' at all! Ringo: Nuffin', guv, nuffin'! The old geezer went and shut 'imself in the back room, didn't 'e? Nash: Locked, it woz. From the inside. Ringo: We know it woz, cos we tried to open it. Nash: But it's a decent door, that one. Good an' strong. Wouldn't budge an inch! Van Zieks: So in the end, the situation remains unchanged. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Inside the storeroom with the pawnbroker there was only one other person. The sole person  who could possibly have shot the victim: the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade! Ryunosuke: Agh! Judge: Hm... It would indeed appear so. What say you to that, Counsel? Ryunosuke: (I don't know...) Was there anyone else apart from Gina who could possibly have shot Mr Windibank? There's no one else Ryunosuke: (He's right. Gina's the only one. There was no one else in the room!) Iris: With an attitude like that, Runo, it really will be all over. Ryunosuke: (Now a ten-year-old is reading the expression on my face...) Iris: Well, you just don't have that many. Wide-eyed, sweating, smug and happy. That's about it! Ryunosuke: (Surely there's more than that... isn't there?) Iris: Aaanyway...I think you might want to consider some other possibilities here. ...Or rather, I think you have to. Otherwise we won't get anywhere. ...Or rather, YOU won't get anywhere. I'm just here for moral support, remember. Leads back to cross-examination There could have been! Ryunosuke: Mr and Mr Skulkin! Nash: Eh?! Wot? Ringo: Wot's that look for? Ryunosuke: From the moment you admitted that you'd encountered the victim face to face that night... ...the course of this trial changed completely. Nash: It did? Van Zieks: What is your point...my learned friend? Ryunosuke: The question we must answer is who could have shot Mr Windibank. And it is the belief of the defence that the defendant is not the only possible answer at all. Van Zieks: You have my attention. In that case...let us return to this plan of the premises. The victim was killed in the storeroom, which was locked from the inside. Those are the facts. So pray...what other possible answer to the question of who shot the man could there be? Judge: Counsel... ...you must now provide answers to the court in respect of two conundrums. Ryunosuke: Two...My Lord? (...Twice as many chances to be right, maybe?) Judge: Indeed. Namely... ...from what location did the culprit shoot the victim? And furthermore... ...where was the victim at the time? Ryunosuke: ......... Understood, My Lord. Iris: Are you alright, Runo? Ryunosuke: I'm not entirely sure. But there's one thing I am sure about. If I can prove that there's a credible new alternative to what happened... ...it would change Gina's prospects hugely! Van Zieks: So now...time for some clarity. Show the court on this plan the answers to the questions posed by His Lordship. If you believe someone else could have killed the victim, indicate from where that person could have fired the gun! Present anywhere Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence believes that the culprit could have shot the victim from this location here. Van Zieks: ......... And in answer to the second question... Assuming the culprit fired from the location indicated, where was the victim at the time? Present storeroom (after presenting main shop) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The culprit shot the victim from outside the storeroom!\" Present storeroom (after presenting storeroom) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence believes that the victim would have been in this position here. Van Zieks: Van Zieks: What your answers in fact show... ...is that your own position is as absurd as those you have indicated on the plan. Ryunosuke: What are you saying? Judge: What Lord van Zieks is saying, Counsel... ...is that your answers are clearly flawed! Ryunosuke: UWAAAAAAGH! (...I knew it. It's twice as many chances to be wrong.) Iris: So the questions are: from where did the culprit shoot the victim, and where was the victim at the time? Well... ...you have to at least choose a place that's outside the storeroom, don't you? Ryunosuke: Oh... Iris: I mean, if you're saying that someone shot Mr Windibank from inside the storeroom, they'll just say it was Ginny. Ryunosuke: ......... You're right. (What's the best move here? Should I try again, or gather more information first?) Give it a try Ryunosuke: The defence would like to point out the locations again! Van Zieks: Well well, you appear to be a glutton for punishment. Leads back to: \"So now...time for some clarity.\" Leave it Ryunosuke: My Lord, I would like to consider the situation a little more before giving my answers again. Van Zieks: Consider the situation as much as you like. The answers do not exist. Judge: Very well. The court will hear from the witnesses again while you deliberate, Counsel. Leads back to cross-examination Otherwise Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence believes that the victim would have been in this position here. Van Zieks: Van Zieks: What your answers in fact show... ...is that your own position is as absurd as those you have indicated on the plan. Ryunosuke: What are you saying? Judge: What Lord van Zieks is saying, Counsel... ...is that your answers are clearly flawed! Ryunosuke: UWAAAAAAGH! (...I knew it. It's twice as many chances to be wrong.) Iris: So the questions are: from where did the culprit shoot the victim, and where was the victim at the time? Well... ...I don't see why we can't show that someone other than Ginny could have done it in the storeroom, do you? Ryunosuke: Yes, that's the right way of looking at it, I suppose. Someone other than Gina in the storeroom... (What's the best move here? Should I try again, or gather more information first?) Give it a try Ryunosuke: The defence would like to point out the locations again! Van Zieks: Well well, you appear to be a glutton for punishment. Leads back to: \"So now...time for some clarity.\" Leave it Ryunosuke: My Lord, I would like to consider the situation a little more before giving my answers again. Van Zieks: Consider the situation as much as you like. The answers do not exist. Judge: Very well. The court will hear from the witnesses again while you deliberate, Counsel. Leads back to cross-examinationRyunosuke: (So that's all these brothers are willing to reveal this time, is it?)Iris: They're still hiding something, don't you think?Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm sure of it. And not just a minor detail, either.Iris: It was almost certainly because of these two that poor Mr Windibank...well... You can't let them get away with it, Runo!Ryunosuke: I know. (But I get the feeling... ...that there's even less evidence at my disposal this time to prove that they did it.)Iris: We've come so far... Now it's time to finish them off!Ryunosuke: Well, I'll do my best.Ryunosuke: The culprit shot the victim from outside the storeroom!Van Zieks: ......... Continue.Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank died instantly from a bullet wound in his back. Looking at the stain of blood on the storeroom floor, it doesn't appear that the body was moved after death. Which tells us that he was almost certainly shot while he was in the storeroom. However, the crucial point is, where was the shooter when the fatal bullet was fired?Judge: So you are adamant...that the shot was fired from outside the storeroom?Ryunosuke: Well, according to the Skulkin brothers' earlier testimony...Nash: I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!Ryunosuke: If Mr Windibank ran away through the door... ...we have to assume that the door was open at the time.Judge: Ah!Ryunosuke: It was at precisely that moment, when the victim was fleeing for his life... ...that these brothers had the perfect opportunity to shoot the man in the back once he was inside the storeroom!NAAAAAAAAAGH!GAAAAAAAAAGH!Van Zieks: ...!Iris: Come to think of it...do you remember what the prosecutor said at the start of the trial?Van Zieks: Moving on to the findings of Scotland Yard's coroner... His report states that the bullet entered the body on a rising diagonal trajectory.Van Zieks: It means...the victim was likely shot by someone significantly shorter in height than himself.Iris: Poor man... Shot while he was running as fast as he could to safety...Ryunosuke: Ah! Of course! He would have been leaning forward as he was running away. So even if the bullet was fired horizontally, it would still have entered his body on an upward trajectory!Iris: So the culprit isn't necessarily someone shorter than Mr Windibank!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: I'm sure my learned friend can't have forgotten... ...that the storeroom door was found closed, and...locked from the inside. You claim the victim was shot as he fled into the room. Do you also claim his corpse was dexterous enough to turn the key in the lock?Ryunosuke: Agh! But...but... ...what if someone else locked the door? Yes! There is someone else who could have locked the storeroom door!Van Zieks: Is that so?Judge: Very well then, Counsel. Present your hypothesis to the court. In the scenario just described... ...the defence's assertion is that the victim was shot from outside the storeroom. In which case, who shut and locked the storeroom door from the inside?Present Gina Lestrade profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Obviously, the person who locked the door was the only other person inside the storeroom at the time...\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Obviously, that person could only have been... Iris: Just a moment, Runo! Ryunosuke: Hm? What? I'm just about to point dramatically at the prosecution and unveil an amazing revelation! Iris: Sorry, but just before you do, maybe you should take a deep breath and think things through one more time? The storeroom was locked from the inside. So whoever locked it must have been inside, too...don't you think? Ryunosuke: Ah, like Mr Windibank, you mean? Iris: Well yes, except that he was dead. But there's someone else it could have been. Only one other person, really. Ryunosuke: Oh... (Only one other?) Judge: You're out of time, I'm afraid. ...For which you must be penalised. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (There's a time limit?) Judge: Now then, let me pose the question again. Leads back to: \"In the scenario just described...\"Ryunosuke: Obviously, the person who locked the door was the only other person inside the storeroom at the time... ...the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: That's absurd! You're suggesting that the accused deliberately engineered the sealed room? For what possible reason?! Such actions would only serve to tighten the noose around her neck!Judge: I am inclined to agree, I must say. ...Well, Counsel?Ryunosuke: ......... Ah...yes...that's a tricky one, that...isn't it?Judge: Half-baked notions have no place in my courtroom, Counsel. Remember that, please.Iris: But of course Ginny would have locked the door. It almost goes without saying, doesn't it?Ryunosuke: It, it does?Iris: Well if I was Ginny in that situation... ...I know I would have locked the door. As quickly as I could! I mean... ...those two burglars had just fired a gun in her direction, hadn't they?Ryunosuke: (Oh yes! Obviously...) Before the two brothers arrived, Miss Lestrade and Mr Windibank were in the storeroom together. Now...I don't know what went on between them at that time, but at some point... ...Mr Windibank must have heard the intruders breaking into his shop, and left the storeroom.Ringo: Intruders, eh? ...That's us, bruv!Van Zieks: If your theory is correct, that would leave the accused alone in the storeroom.Ryunosuke: ...Yes, it would. Then, probably only moments later, the victim fled back through the storeroom door hoping to escape danger.*BANG!*Ryunosuke: Hit in the back by the bullet, Mr Windibank fell to the floor where he was, just inside the storeroom. And what we have to ask ourselves now is, what would the defendant have done in that moment?Nash: Ah! I, I see where yer goin' wiv this!Ryunosuke: Outside the storeroom was a terrifying killer who had just murdered Mr Windibank. As soon as that thought struck Miss Lestrade, she slammed the door shut and locked it... ...in order to save her own life!Van Zieks: ...!Judge: ...!???:Nash: But, but I ain't- I mean, we ain't the ones who dunnit!Ringo: We ain't, guv, we ain't! You've gotta believe us! I mean, come on! We'd never shoot no one!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: That's blatantly untrue! I know for a fact that you would. Because before my own eyes...you shot Mr Herlock Sholmes!Ringo: ...!Nash: ...!Ryunosuke: There is only one logical conclusion here. Mr and Mr Skulkin, you brothers had every opportunity... ...to have been the true perpetrators of Mr Windibank's murder!Nash: Ah...em...um...Ringo: Erm...em...ugh...NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!Where, where does this leave us? You mean to say it wasn't the pickpocket who shot the pawnbroker after all? I should have known it was those three brothers! They look as shady as a dense forest!Iris: That was amazing, Runo! All the members of the jury seem to be firmly on your side now!Ryunosuke: I know! First time ever! And probably the last...Iris: Well, I think you've done it! Surely they'll have to give a verdict of not-Van Zieks: ...Keh...heh...heh... An admirable effort...my learned friend.Ryunosuke: ...! (What's this now? He's laughing?)Judge: You find the situation amusing, Lord van Zieks? I myself find the defence's argument most persuasive.Van Zieks: I dare say... ...such chicanery is the bread and butter of the street performers in your provincial Eastern nation. But such blatantly malicious conjuring tricks amount to nothing more than inexcusable pettifoggery here.Ryunosuke: What?!Van Zieks: The hypothesis you put forward so ostensibly credibly cannot, and will not stand. Because, you see, it contains a fatal flaw!Ryunosuke: A, a fatal flaw?!Van Zieks: ...Do you mean to tell me that you're unaware of your logic's failing?Juror No. 1: I say! Lord van Zieks... Might be an idea to explain this bally conjuring trick or whatever it is to the troops on the ground, hm?Van Zieks: The fatal flaw in my learned friend's argument is really very simple to understand... ...assuming you're not too dim-witted to count bullets!Juror No. 1: By George! Count bullets?!Iris: Oh dear... ...he noticed then.Ryunosuke: Huh? (What's everyone talking about?)Van Zieks: Counsel!Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, sir?!Van Zieks: Tell the court, how many bullets were found at the scene of the crime?Ryunosuke: Um...two. Two bullets.Van Zieks: Correct. The first, that which hit the victim in the back, ending his life. And the second, that which struck the 'detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes, on his arrival at the scene.Judge: Indeed. The defence presented a picture showing the damage caused by the second bullet earlier in the proceedings. The bullet which injured Mr Sholmes appears to have passed through his body to strike the calendar.Van Zieks: Your Lordship's understanding is correct. Furthermore, we know there are two firearms involved in the incident. The revolver belonging to the victim, Mr Windibank... ...and the Skulkin brothers' revolver. The evidence shows that a single bullet was fired from each gun.Judge: Yes! Indeed it does! A single bullet from each!Van Zieks: Now then, my learned friend...Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: You yourself told the court only moments ago... ...that these two brothers shot Mr Herlock Sholmes right before your eyes.Ryunosuke: Yes, I, I did!Juror No. 3: Oh my goodness! I, I think you'll find...Juror No. 4: That if the single bullet that was fired from the brothers' gun hit Mr Sholmes, it means...Juror No. 5: Windibank not shot by same gun! Stop. Only one bullet! Stop.Van Zieks: ...Exactly. Yes, this Nipponese street performer presented an ostensibly credible argument. ...However! It was never anything more than a diversionary trick with no hope of standing up to scrutiny!Ryunosuke: Ugh............ UWAAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!Van Zieks: ...Pray forgive the discourtesy of flinging the dregs of this hallowed nectar into the public gallery...Judge: L-Lord van Zieks!Van Zieks: ...but this court needs to open its eyes. The accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, is no ordinary little girl. Despite her young years, she can, regrettably, no longer be described as a juvenile. No, the person in the dock is far from a law-abiding citizen. She has a past riddled with criminal conduct!Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Van Zieks: The truth is, the accused broke into the pawnbrokery on the night in question with loathsome intent... ...as we can see beyond doubt in this print which depicts her threatening the victim with the murder weapon!Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Van Zieks: And I have here in my possession one more piece of evidence the prosecution wishes to present.Ryunosuke: ...! (That disk!)Gregson: I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much!Gina: No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!Gregson: I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.Ryunosuke: (Yes, that music box disk... McGilded's music box disk...)Van Zieks: The very day before the hateful murder of Mr Windibank... ...the accused attempted to make off with this article, which clearly doesn't belong to her. And with none of the subtlety of a pickpocket, I might add. But by brute force and brazen impudence.Judge: Good gracious!Van Zieks: Make no mistake! Any sympathy for the accused on account of her years is misguided and dangerous! There are no depths to which this girl would not stoop if pushed. No crime she would not commit. ...The court forgets that fact at its peril.Juror No. 5: ...!Juror No. 6: ...!Judge: Hm...I see... I think it would be prudent to take this music box disk into evidence, Counsel. As a grim testament to the defendant's character.???:Gregson: Um...Lord van Zieks...I, um...Ryunosuke: (Inspector Gregson...what...?)Van Zieks: Yes, Inspector?Gregson: We had a meetin' yesterday at the Yard with the prosecution service, and, um... ...I, I think it was agreed that that disk wouldn't be used as evidence.Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: (What's this all about? Why is the inspector acting strangely? That's the first time he's said anything to van Zieks at all...)Van Zieks: I am unaware of any such meeting.Gregson: But! But those were the instructions, right from the top. The government bigwigs were insistent!Van Zieks: Inspector, I am the prosecutor, and I alone determine how to present my case. Your warning is noted. ...Thank you.Gregson: ...!Van Zieks: The prosecution wishes to proceed with submitting this disk as evidence, My Lord.Judge: In-Indeed. Bailiff!The music box disk has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: The prosecution has established the accused's motive, opportunity and baseness of character. There is nothing more to add. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I await your informed decisions...and rest my case.Examine evidence Music Box Disk Bloodstain Iris: Oh! Runo, look! This is blood! Ryunosuke: Yes, you're right. (Just a small smear, but definitely blood. Actually, I feel as though I might have noticed that before...) Iris: Haha! Then it's my time to shine again! I thought I'd be waiting forever! Alright, hold still with that disk, Runo. Ryunosuke: Can we get this done quickly, Iris? Iris: In a flash! Ooh! A lovely bright shade again. Ryunosuke: ......... (Wait, that colour...) Iris: What is it? Ryunosuke: It's just...that green, it... ...it's not the first time we've seen that colour, is it? The blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record. Bloodstain (subsequent times) Iris: So this is blood! Probably from somebody's fingertip. Ryunosuke: Well deduced. But not just somebody's fingertip... Mr Benedict's fingertip. Iris: The man dressed all in white? Ryunosuke: Yes. It happened that afternoon in Windibank's. Gina tried to snatch this disk out of the man's hands, and the sharp little bumps cut his thumb. Iris: So the lesson is, if someone tries to grab a music box disk from you, let go quickly. Ryunosuke: ...The lesson is don't snatch things, surely? Note on back Iris: 'For McGilded'... That's the man you defended in court a couple of months ago, isn't it, Runo? Ryunosuke: Yes. Or rather, mistakenly defended. Iris: I wonder what his name is doing on the back of this disk... Ryunosuke: That's a question I'd love to know the answer to myself.Ryunosuke: (I don't believe it... I had the jury on my side for once, for all of five minutes...)Iris: Oh dear... It wasn't even for five minutes, Runo...???:My Lord!Juror No. 1: Wonder if I might say something at this point?Judge: Proceed, Mr Foreman.Juror No. 1: Been stumbling about in a bit of a fog up to now, if truth be told. But all of a sudden... ...the answer's bally obvious to me and my men! There's only one thing for it!Ryunosuke: (Oh no!)Judge: Very well. The court will hear from the jury. Ladies and gentlemen, you will present your leanings as to the defendant's culpability.Juror No. 1: Guilty!Juror No. 2: Guilty!Juror No. 3: Guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Guilty!Judge: We have a consensus among the jury, it seems.Van Zieks: When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains...must be the truth.Iris: That's, that's my line! I wrote that! For Hurley! Argh! How dare he use it against us?!Ryunosuke: Don't worry, Iris. I don't think we're finished yet. (There's still more to this case than we realise. There must be, because there's one thing that I'm absolutely certain of. Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank! That's beyond any doubt!)Judge: Very well... ...we will proceed with the second summation examination of the day. Mr Foreman, are you and the other jurors ready?Juror No. 1: Garrideb Squadron is primed and ready for action, sir!Judge: Very good. So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have now determined the defendant to be guilty!Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1: Once a rogue always a rogue, I say...hm? Different breed to us law-abiding citizens!Juror No. 2: As only two bullets were found at the scene, I would say the whole case is done and dusted.Juror No. 3: You don't need a stereoscope to see the truth here. Every which way you look at it, it was that pickpocket!Juror No. 4: Hm...I never imagined that simple operation would cause me such grief...Juror No. 5: The accused attempted a theft on the previous day. ...I can see I'm in for a busy day ahead.Juror No. 6: I am ballistics expert. I have seen many shootings. There is nothing I do not know about guns.Judge: Hmmm... It would seem there is little remaining room for doubt.Juror No. 1: Have to admit, I was rather bowled over by the argument put forward by the chap in black. But when that fell apart like a house of cards, I saw that I'd jolly well been hoodwinked. Well, no more!Ryunosuke: (Ugh...the whole courtroom is turning against me.)Iris: It's not fair!Ryunosuke: Iris?Iris: That prosecutor's being mean! Just because Ginny's done some things she shouldn't have done in the past... ...that doesn't make her a murderer!Van Zieks: Allow me to savour this fruity vintage while I savour the spectacle of your fruitless debate on the matter. Here's to the truth coming out...eventually.Ryunosuke: .........Judge: That's enough preamble. Counsel, proceed with the summation examination.Ryunosuke: ...Yes, My Lord.Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1: Once a rogue always a rogue, I say...hm? Different breed to us law-abiding citizens!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Just because Miss Lestrade has a history of pickpocketing, she must be guilty of murder, is that what you're saying? Juror No. 1: Ah...well... Ryunosuke: Are all members of the British army so quick to judge? Juror No. 1: I beg your pardon? Are you mocking Her Majesty's armed forces? The greatest military organisation in the world! Ryunosuke: No. I'm simply illustrating my point. Juror No. 1: ...! Ryunosuke: Making assumptions about people because they're a soldier...or a pickpocket...is wrong, and dangerous. Juror No. 1: Hmph. Well, yes, might have a point there, I suppose. But let's not forget the girl had already shown she had it in her from before. She's clearly a criminal sort through and through. Can't deny it. Ryunosuke: When you say that she'd 'shown she had it in her'...are you referring to this? Juror No. 1: Exactly. Tried to swipe that only a day earlier, hm? Or am I mistaken? Ryunosuke: ...Not exactly. (Given that I was actually there at the time, it's hard to refute that.) Iris: I've never actually seen the real thing. I can't wait to have a closer look at it! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, of course... Mr Sholmes did use his caramel bars to make a copy of the disk, didn't he. (And then ordered every type of music box he could find from across Europe...) Iris: We still don't know what tune it plays though, do we? But I'd love to see how the original compares to Hurley's copy. Ryunosuke: (McGilded's disk... Could it be a clue somehow? Perhaps we should examine it in more detail...)Juror No. 2: As only two bullets were found at the scene, I would say the whole case is done and dusted.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It's the number of bullets that has you convinced? Juror No. 2: Only two bullets were fired, and the two guns that fired them have been examined by the police. When the parlour maid asks me how many are invited for dinner, I always tell her to count the table settings. Ryunosuke: (Well, that's logical, I suppose.) Juror No. 2: Although... Ryunosuke: Yes? Juror No. 2: ...sometimes after dining, crockery does go missing. One or two guests rather like the fine china. Ryunosuke: ...Does your employer dine with thieves? Juror No. 2: So I suppose... ...if there was another bullet somewhere of which we were unaware... ...I'd have to reconsider my position. Ryunosuke: (...A third bullet somewhere on the scene? Could that be possible?) It's impossible Ryunosuke: Unfortunately... ...only two bullets were discovered by the police during their investigation. Juror No. 2: Yes, I know. Ryunosuke: Right... Juror No. 2: And I don't imagine the good men of Scotland Yard would have overlooked anything. If I missed a bullet while I was cleaning His Lordship's office, well! I should receive a sound scolding, I don't doubt. Ryunosuke: ...And he should receive a visit from the police, perhaps. It sounds like a crime scene to me. Iris: Hm, a third bullet.... Ryunosuke: It would completely turn things around if there was one, wouldn't it? Iris: ...Do you think we might find one lying around somewhere? Leads back to cross-examination I can prove it! Ryunosuke: Allow me to show you, then...the third bullet! Present The Third Bullet Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Here it is.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I, um...don't suppose this would pass as the third bullet? Van Zieks: It passes for a bullet as much as you pass for a lawyer... my learned friend. Ryunosuke: (Coming from you, I'm going to take that as meaning, 'not much'.) Van Zieks: In no way does it resemble a bullet...if that helps your understanding of my last remark. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Judge: Counsel, at the very least I would expect the evidence you present to be of the correct form! Ryunosuke: (...It's been a long day.) Iris: Let's actually try to find this third bullet before we attempt that again, Runo. Leads back to cross-examinationJuror No. 3: You don't need a stereoscope to see the truth here. Every which way you look at it, it was that pickpocket!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So if I've understood correctly, you need two pictures: a left eye one and a slightly different right eye one. Juror No. 3: Eeexactly! Then you can see the scene in three dimensions ...like this! Ryunosuke: So...if we have two bullets...I don't suppose you can see anything useful with them? Juror No. 3: Hm, I think you'll find... ...that no matter how much you squint, the truth of the situation always looks the same here. The only person who could have shot the victim is that girl in the dock! Ryunosuke: How can you be so sure of that? Juror No. 3: Think about it! The Skulkin brothers shot the great detective, didn't they? Ryunosuke: Yes...that's been mentioned once or twice... Juror No. 3: Well then! Surely it's coming into focus now, isn't it? Ryunosuke: (This is a waste of time. I'm not going to change this man's mind any time soon.)Juror No. 4: Hm...I never imagined that simple operation would cause me such grief...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Would you please stop muttering about things that have nothing to do with this trial, sir? The defendant's life is on the line here! Juror No. 4: Hm, well, the thing is... ...I couldn't really say that it is nothing to do with this trial, to be honest. Ryunosuke: Huh? Juror No. 4: I mean, there's no question that the man was shot, but the bullet had simply vanished from his stomach. It's quite inexplicable. ...Don't you think? Ryunosuke: ......... I almost don't want to ask, but this surgery you've been muttering about all this time. You were operating on... Juror No. 4: What was the fellow's name now? Herr Lich? ...No. Herr Loch? ...No. Hairlock? Ryunosuke: Herlock Sholmes by any chance? Juror No. 4: Yes! Good Lord! It was that Hairlock fellow! Ryunosuke: WHAAAT?! You're, you're the surgeon that operated on Mr Sholmes?! Juror No. 4: That's right. Using the very latest anaesthesia techniques, I might add! It was a fairly major op, I can tell you. Ryunosuke: (This is crazy!) Juror No. 4: Let me see, the fellow was brought in not long after midnight, if I remember correctly. They said he'd been shot by some criminal or other. So I opened him up like a shot. But the funny thing is, I went over his insides with a fine-tooth comb, and couldn't find the bullet anywhere. So I'm afraid I had to throw up my hands and just stitch the fellow back up. Ryunosuke: ......... I hate to state the obvious, but... Juror No. 4: Yes? Ryunosuke: ...surely that's because the bullet is still at the scene of the shooting! Judge: The counsel for the defence is correct. As is clearly shown in this photographic print. Ryunosuke: The bullet that the Skulkin brothers fired at Mr Sholmes hit him in the stomach region... ...then exited his body and lodged into the shop wall where the calendar was hanging by the door. I think you'll find it's really quite simple if you just consider the problem three-dimensionally. Juror No. 4: Hah! Who do you think I am, son? Ryunosuke: ...Um, well, 'juror number four' is about the best I can do. Juror No. 4: As soon as I saw the wound to the man's stomach, I flipped him over. Ryunosuke: ...Like a pancake? Are, are you saying that you checked his back? Juror No. 4: Of course I did! And there wasn't a trace of injury. No sign that the bullet had left the body at all! Ryunosuke: What? Juror No. 4: That's the point! The only logical conclusion was that the bullet was still somewhere in the man's innards! Which is exactly why I set about slicing him up! And I'm still none the wiser, even now! How many times do I have to say it? Can somebody please explain how it happened? Can somebody please solve the mystery! Ryunosuke: ...It's almost as much of a mystery as how this jury was put together. Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"The mystery of where that bullet ended up is infuriating! Where's an expert when you need one?\"Juror No. 4: The mystery of where that bullet ended up is infuriating! Where's an expert when you need one?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes's surgeon is on the jury...? I've experienced some coincidences recently, but this is ridiculous. Juror No. 4: I'm as surprised as anyone! Ryunosuke: But there's no question that Mr Sholmes was shot? Juror No. 4: Well, that's what the police told me when they brought him in. Iris: ...How bad were his injuries, doctor? Juror No. 4: He was in a bad way. He'd lost a huge amount of blood, you know. And I suspect he was shot at quite close range, too. Because his skin was badly burnt around the point of entry. Ryunosuke: Burnt? Juror No. 4: As I said, I flipped the fellow over and examined his back, but there was no sign of an exit wound. Which is why I thought I'd better locate the lug and pop it out. Ryunosuke: And yet you say you found no bullet inside the patient? Juror No. 4: Well I wouldn't have done, would I? Because it's in the wall of the pawnbroker's. But how did it get there?! I need someone to solve this mystery before it drives me to insanity! If only there were some expert in ballistics who could help! Even if he looked extremely untrustworthy! Ryunosuke: (So we have a disappearing bullet on our hands...)Pit against Juror No. 6's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict...the idea that all I do is pit jurors against each other! Juror No. 4: Ooh! A ballistics expert! Juror No. 6: 'Pitting'... 'P-i-t-t-...' Ryunosuke: On the night in question, Mr Sholmes was shot by one of the Skulkin brothers. But since there was no sign of an exit wound on his back, we must assume the bullet didn't pass through him. However, no bullet was found lodged in Mr Sholmes's body, either. Furthermore... ...a bullet was found lodged in the wall of the shop where Mr Sholmes was shot. Juror number six... Juror No. 6: 'Hello. My name is Vilen. Pleased to meet you.' Ryunosuke: This apparent contradiction in the facts that is so clearly troubling juror number four... Are you able to explain the mystery? Juror No. 6: ......... I have seen wery similar situation in motherland. Ryunosuke: ...! Juror No. 6: It was night. There was blizzard. I was running away long mountain round in freezing cold. Judge: Golly. Juror No. 6: The snow was piling high on both sides of road. It was wery narrow and dangerous. My pursuers had hunting rifles and they were on dog sleds. Ryunosuke: (...Mental note: don't ask too many questions.) Juror No. 6: I was shot from behind, and I fell down in snow. And this situation was wery similar to what I hear today from doctor. They could not find bullet in my body. And no sign of - how do you say? - exit wound. Judge: Then, then where did the bullet go? Juror No. 6: Bullet never hit me. Juror No. 4: Well if it never hit you, why did you fall down? Juror No. 6: Bullet hit frozen wall of ice wery close to my side. Ryunosuke: What?! Juror No. 6: One small piece - wery sharp - broke away from lump of ice and pierced my body. It made deep wound that looks just like bullet wound. Juror No. 4: Good gracious... Juror No. 6: Of course, piece of ice quickly melted inside me. And that is solution to mystery of disappearing bullet. Ryunosuke: ......... Juror No. 6: ......... Juror No. 4: But, but that doesn't answer the question at all! Ryunosuke: Hm? Juror No. 4: The shooting happened in a pawnbroker's shop... ...not some snowy mountain road in another country! Ryunosuke: ......... ...Just an idea, but we might not be looking at EXACTLY the same scenario here. Iris: Runo... ...where exactly was Hurley shot again? Ryunosuke: Um, well, according to the report, in his stomach. Sort of around this area, I think. Iris: Well...that's precisely where he always wears a little pouch on his belt. Ryunosuke: A pouch? (Actually, I might have noticed something like that.) Iris: Yes, a pouch. It's where he keeps three glass phials of very dangerous chemicals that he uses in his investigations. Ryunosuke: What?! (Really?) Doctor! Where is the pouch Mr Sholmes was wearing? Juror No. 4: Hm, well... ...the fellow had nothing like that on his person when he arrived at the hospital as far as I remember. Van Zieks: If I may... Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks...? Van Zieks: While I realise it is forbidden for the prosecution to interject during a summation examination... ...I should inform the defence that I have the pouch in question in the antechamber outside the courtroom. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: As I understand it, when the police arrived on the scene and found Mr Sholmes injured... ...they removed the pouch in order to assess the wound. Juror No. 4: Ah! Thank goodness. I thought I was getting forgetful for a moment! Van Zieks: Since then, it has been in my safekeeping along with all other evidence relating to the case. I can personally vouch for the fact that it has not been touched since the incident occurred. Judge: Very well. While extremely unconventional during a summation examination... ...I must demand the prosecution presents the item in question with all speed. Bring forth Mr Herlock Sholmes's pouch! Judge: Hm, I see... So this is the pouch worn by Mr Sholmes on the night in question, is it? Ryunosuke: Look at that! One of the phials is broken and the leather around it is scorched black! It's almost as if...the phial exploded! Judge: Exploded? Ryunosuke: So...that night... ...the bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun struck Mr Sholmes's pouch. Juror No. 4: And it was the glass phial exploding that caused the fellow's injury! Juror No. 6: The bullet did not penetrate wictim, but was deflected into wall of shop. Van Zieks: ......... ...A delightfully complex aroma. Judge: Well, it would appear one mystery has been solved at least. Van Zieks: Though it has no bearing on the truth of this case. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: The bungling and burgling brothers shot the detective, and the accused shot the pawnbroker. The pertinent facts of the case remain unaltered. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 4: But at least the mystery is solved! I can sleep easy tonight! Thank you, young man! Juror No. 6: ...Da. 'Thank you wery much.' Ryunosuke: ...Glad I could help. Judge: Due to its bearing on the conundrum just solved, the court will sequester this scruffy pouch as evidence. Iris: Hurley's pouch isn't scruffy! Sholmes's pouch has been entered into the Court Record. Judge: Now, the summation examination... It would appear the defence is somewhat struggling to alter opinion, hm? Ryunosuke: Please, My Lord! A little more time. (After all, that's a new piece of evidence. It could be a valuable clue. And you can't afford to overlook anything here, Ryunosuke. There's still a way to turn this around...somehow. I'm sure of it!) Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.\"Examine evidence Sholmes's Pouch Scorch mark on left side Ryunosuke: (It's really scorched badly just here...) Iris: Oh! The strap is broken, look! Ryunosuke: This must be where the bullet hit, then. Iris: Let me see... Bullet Ryunosuke: Wh-What the... Iris! Look! Behind where the broken phial was... Do you see it? Iris: AAAH! That's... ...the Skulkin brothers' bullet! Ryunosuke: (What a stroke of luck that it hit his pouch!) This is an amazing discovery! (What this means is... ...there were three bullets fired at Windibank's that night!) Iris: We've found exactly what that juror was talking about! The third bullet! Ryunosuke: It's time to press that juror again, I think! The third bullet has been entered into the Court Record. Bullet hole (after examining bullet) Ryunosuke: (This is where the third bullet was lodged. Imagine what would have happened if it had pierced the leather... Thank goodness Mr Sholmes is going to be alright.) Scorch mark on left side (after examining bullet) Ryunosuke: (It's really scorched badly just here...) Iris: Yes, the strap is broken. Ryunosuke: Ripped apart by the bullet, obviously.  Iris: Let me see... Hole on back Ryunosuke: Oh look...there's a hole here at the back. (It doesn't look much like a bullet hole. But clearly something's ripped through the leather with great force.) Iris: Something must have pierced it somehow to have left this hole behind. Ryunosuke: Yes, it looks that way. Mr Sholmes and his pouch both took a beating, didn't they? Broken vial Ryunosuke: This phial has been smashed to pieces. Presumably this is where the bullet struck. Iris: As soon as the bullet hit the chemical in that phial, there would have been a really big explosion. Ryunosuke: A big explosion?! Iris: Well Hurley's potions and chemicals are amazingly useful for the investigation work he does. But they're also quite tricky to handle. Safely, at least. They're very dangerous. Ryunosuke: Oh. Iris: I'm sure that when this phial broke, the chemical inside would have ignited. Ryunosuke: ......... (Note to self: Always walk on the right-hand side of Sholmes in future. The left is the danger zone.) Intact vials Iris: These glass phials are full of Hurley's homemade potions. Ryunosuke: Homemade...? Iris: Yes, like fingerprint powder to show up where people have touched things... ...and scent-amplifying solution to intensify a smell lingering on an object. Ryunosuke: That's...amazing. Iris: They're all very easy to use. There's just one thing that you have to be careful of: They're all very flammable. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes is a walking bomb! (Either he's passionate about finding out the truth, or just oblivious to the dangers...) The Third Bullet Bullet Ryunosuke: This is the bullet that was fired from the Skulkin brothers' gun on the night of the incident. Iris: Yes. So it turns out it never actually entered Hurley's body at all. Ryunosuke: Thanks to the thick leather of that pouch he was wearing. It saved him. Iris: Hehe, Hurley's always lucky like that. Ryunosuke: Well...considering what he had to go through in hospital... ...I wonder how lucky he really was. Iris: Oh dear...poor Hurley...Juror No. 4: Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Then I ask you to reconsider your leaning, sir! Juror No. 4: Oh no, that's another matter entirely. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Juror No. 4: All I can think about for the moment...is this wonderful sense of relief I have that the mystery is solved. I need some time to let that sink in before I could possibly consider anything else. Ryunosuke: Alright... (I thought surgeons had to be able to think quickly...) Iris: Perhaps we should leave him alone for now while he savours his inner peace... ...and focus on some of the other jurors? Ryunosuke: I suppose we'll have to. ...I wish I had the chance to experience inner peace sometimes.Juror No. 5: The accused attempted a theft on the previous day. ...I can see I'm in for a busy day ahead.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you mean, you're in for a busy day? Juror No. 5: Forgot to say. Stop. Do excuse me. Stop. I am a communications officer. Stop. Ryunosuke: A communications officer? Does that have something to do with sending telegrams? Juror No. 5: Everything from personal messages written by members of the public to the latest news in the capital. I convert all the messages into morse code and tap it out to the entire world electronically. Ryunosuke: To...the entire world? Juror No. 5: Thousands of miles of cable under the sea! Stop. Worldwide communication network! Stop. Information transmitted to and from all corners of globe! Stop. Ryunosuke: (Ah yes... ...she was getting equally worked up about radio waves or the like before, wasn't she?) Juror No. 5: I specialise in communicating information from government departments and newspaper offices. Ryunosuke: I see. Juror No. 5: I'm sure I shall have to wire the newspaper reports of today's guilty verdict later. So no sleep for me tonight, I imagine. Ryunosuke: (...Let's just finish the trial first, shall we?)Juror No. 6: I am ballistics expert. I have seen many shootings. There is nothing I do not know about guns.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I thought...you were just a tourist? Juror No. 6: ......... 'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.' Ryunosuke: (...There's no way he's just a 'wisiting' tourist.) So...you're a ballistics expert? ...Who knew? Juror No. 6: I have much experience with guns. Ryunosuke: Ah. Juror No. 6: I have lived through many - how do you say? Em... Extreme...em...wiolent...bath of...em... No. Blood of...em... Iris: Ah! Extreme violent bloodbaths, perhaps? Juror No. 6: Da! Those! Extreme wiolent bloodbaths! ...English is wery difficult language. Ryunosuke: (...Considering the sort of people you associate with, I'm surprised you still have a tongue.) Juror No. 6: Anyway. If you have questions about bullets and guns, you ask me. There is nothing I do not know. No mystery I cannot solve. Ryunosuke: (He's very confident in his knowledge of guns, that's for sure.) Juror No. 6: But...if possible, please, only in Russian language. Iris: He's not very confident in his knowledge of English, though, is he? Ryunosuke: No... Still, we should bear it in mind. (He's our man if there's a mystery about guns or bullets.)Pit against Juror No. 4's statement (after Juror No. 4 changes his statement, before Juror No. 4 changes his statement a second time) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict...the idea that all I do is pit jurors against each other! Juror No. 4: Ooh! A ballistics expert! Juror No. 6: 'Pitting'... 'P-i-t-t-...' Ryunosuke: On the night in question, Mr Sholmes was shot by one of the Skulkin brothers. But since there was no sign of an exit wound on his back, we must assume the bullet didn't pass through him. However, no bullet was found lodged in Mr Sholmes's body, either. Furthermore... ...a bullet was found lodged in the wall of the shop where Mr Sholmes was shot. Juror number six... Juror No. 6: 'Hello. My name is Vilen. Pleased to meet you.' Ryunosuke: This apparent contradiction in the facts that is so clearly troubling juror number four... Are you able to explain the mystery? Juror No. 6: ......... I have seen wery similar situation in motherland. Ryunosuke: ...! Juror No. 6: It was night. There was blizzard. I was running away long mountain round in freezing cold. Judge: Golly. Juror No. 6: The snow was piling high on both sides of road. It was wery narrow and dangerous. My pursuers had hunting rifles and they were on dog sleds. Ryunosuke: (...Mental note: don't ask too many questions.) Juror No. 6: I was shot from behind, and I fell down in snow. And this situation was wery similar to what I hear today from doctor. They could not find bullet in my body. And no sign of - how do you say? - exit wound. Judge: Then, then where did the bullet go? Juror No. 6: Bullet never hit me. Juror No. 4: Well if it never hit you, why did you fall down? Juror No. 6: Bullet hit frozen wall of ice wery close to my side. Ryunosuke: What?! Juror No. 6: One small piece - wery sharp - broke away from lump of ice and pierced my body. It made deep wound that looks just like bullet wound. Juror No. 4: Good gracious... Juror No. 6: Of course, piece of ice quickly melted inside me. And that is solution to mystery of disappearing bullet. Ryunosuke: ......... Juror No. 6: ......... Juror No. 4: But, but that doesn't answer the question at all! Ryunosuke: Hm? Juror No. 4: The shooting happened in a pawnbroker's shop... ...not some snowy mountain road in another country! Ryunosuke: ......... ...Just an idea, but we might not be looking at EXACTLY the same scenario here. Iris: Runo... ...where exactly was Hurley shot again? Ryunosuke: Um, well, according to the report, in his stomach. Sort of around this area, I think. Iris: Well...that's precisely where he always wears a little pouch on his belt. Ryunosuke: A pouch? (Actually, I might have noticed something like that.) Iris: Yes, a pouch. It's where he keeps three glass phials of very dangerous chemicals that he uses in his investigations. Ryunosuke: What?! (Really?) Doctor! Where is the pouch Mr Sholmes was wearing? Juror No. 4: Hm, well... ...the fellow had nothing like that on his person when he arrived at the hospital as far as I remember. Van Zieks: If I may... Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks...? Van Zieks: While I realise it is forbidden for the prosecution to interject during a summation examination... ...I should inform the defence that I have the pouch in question in the antechamber outside the courtroom. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: As I understand it, when the police arrived on the scene and found Mr Sholmes injured... ...they removed the pouch in order to assess the wound. Juror No. 4: Ah! Thank goodness. I thought I was getting forgetful for a moment! Van Zieks: Since then, it has been in my safekeeping along with all other evidence relating to the case. I can personally vouch for the fact that it has not been touched since the incident occurred. Judge: Very well. While extremely unconventional during a summation examination... ...I must demand the prosecution presents the item in question with all speed. Bring forth Mr Herlock Sholmes's pouch! Judge: Hm, I see... So this is the pouch worn by Mr Sholmes on the night in question, is it? Ryunosuke: Look at that! One of the phials is broken and the leather around it is scorched black! It's almost as if...the phial exploded! Judge: Exploded? Ryunosuke: So...that night... ...the bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun struck Mr Sholmes's pouch. Juror No. 4: And it was the glass phial exploding that caused the fellow's injury! Juror No. 6: The bullet did not penetrate wictim, but was deflected into wall of shop. Van Zieks: ......... ...A delightfully complex aroma. Judge: Well, it would appear one mystery has been solved at least. Van Zieks: Though it has no bearing on the truth of this case. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: The bungling and burgling brothers shot the detective, and the accused shot the pawnbroker. The pertinent facts of the case remain unaltered. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 4: But at least the mystery is solved! I can sleep easy tonight! Thank you, young man! Juror No. 6: ...Da. 'Thank you wery much.' Ryunosuke: ...Glad I could help. Judge: Due to its bearing on the conundrum just solved, the court will sequester this scruffy pouch as evidence. Iris: Hurley's pouch isn't scruffy! Sholmes's pouch has been entered into the Court Record. Judge: Now, the summation examination... It would appear the defence is somewhat struggling to alter opinion, hm? Ryunosuke: Please, My Lord! A little more time. (After all, that's a new piece of evidence. It could be a valuable clue. And you can't afford to overlook anything here, Ryunosuke. There's still a way to turn this around...somehow. I'm sure of it!) Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.\"Before Sholmes's Pouch is added to Court Record Ryunosuke: (Van Zieks has managed to convince everyone...) Iris: 'When you have eliminated the impossible...' he said. But he hasn't! Ryunosuke: (If we're going to fight back, we need more material. And we have to fight back! We have to turn this trial around again!)After Sholmes's Pouch is added to Court Record Iris: Hurley always turns up at just the right moment! Ryunosuke: ...Does he always come in the form of a pouch? (Seriously though, it sounds like the great detective was on death's door. But maybe his injuries won't be for nothing. That pouch could be a very valuable clue.)Ryunosuke: Here it is. We discovered it just now. Yes! On the night in question in Windibank's pawnbrokery...another bullet was fired!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: What is this new trickery, you Nipponese conjurer?! Where did you find that bullet?Ryunosuke: It was lodged inside Mr Sholmes's pouch.Van Zieks: What?!Ryunosuke: This pouch was removed from around Mr Sholmes's waist before he was taken to hospital. And since then, it has been touched by no one.Judge: Do, do you mean to say... ...the shot fired by the Skulkin brothers that night...Ryunosuke: Yes. As your Lordship has surmised...it hit this pouch.Judge: But that makes no sense whatsoever! We already know the whereabouts of the bullet fired at Mr Sholmes. It's clearly visible in this photographic print!Juror No. 1: Ah!Ryunosuke: Two guns from the scene have already been submitted into the Court Record as evidence.Judge: Yes. That of Mr Windibank, and that belonging to the Skulkin brothers.Ryunosuke: And examination of both guns revealed... ...that only a single bullet had been fired from each.Juror No. 2: Ah!Juror No. 3: But, but that must mean...Ryunosuke: That's right. We now know that on the night in question, three bullets were fired. However! Only two bullets were fired from the guns recovered from the crime scene! And until that incontrovertible inconsistency is somehow explained... ...we cannot and must not pass judgement!Van Zieks: Agk......... AAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! While this summation examination remains incomplete, the court has been presented with new facts. Facts that would appear to shake the very foundations upon which the case against the defendant has been built.Van Zieks: ...!Judge: As is my prerogative in this situation... ...I hereby temporarily suspend the summation examination.Juror No. 1: By Jupiter!Ryunosuke: What?!Judge: Bailiff! Bring the witnesses back to the stand at once!Judge: Witnesses...Nash: Guvnor!Judge: Were you listening to proceedings while the defence carried out the summation examination?Ringo: We woz, guvnor, we woz!Van Zieks: Perhaps we can dispense with the tedious preamble. Simply answer this one question: A third bullet has been identified at the scene of the crime. ...What do you make of that?Nash: Make of it, guv? I dun't make nuffin' of nuffin' if I can 'elp it. Um...Van Zieks: Is it one of yours?Ringo: Gorblimey, guv, gorblimey! Not a chance!Van Zieks: In that case...did you have an accomplice?Nash: Wot?! Eh? Wot?! Never! The Skulkin bruvvers work alone!Ringo: It's just the two of us! That's our trademark!Ryunosuke: (...How soon we forget poor Sulky...)Van Zieks: Only two of the bullets from the crime scene originated from the firearms we have in evidence. The third bullet was fired from another gun. ...Where is it?Nash: Lummy...that's an 'ead-scratcher... .........Judge: Hmmm... Counsel for the Defence...Ryunosuke: Y-Yes?Judge: I should like to hear your thoughts regarding these new developments. The third bullet...and the mysterious missing firearm from whence it came.Ryunosuke: (Thinking back over all the testimony we've heard and all the evidence we've seen... ...I think I'm starting to form a picture. A picture of what really happened that night.) My Lord, I think it's clear what this third bullet tells us about the Skulkin brothers:They had a secret accomplice Ryunosuke: On that night at Windibank's pawnbrokery...the brothers must have been working with a third man. Nash: Erm... Ryunosuke: The witnesses are clearly doing their best to cover up the existence of this accomplice... ...but the evidence all points to the fact that there was someone else present! Someone carrying a gun! Van Zieks: Leads to: \"...An accomplice, you say?\"They had another gun Ryunosuke: On that night at Windibank's pawnbrokery...the brothers must have been in possession of another gun. Nash: Erm... Ryunosuke: We know that only one bullet was fired from each of the two firearms already in the Court Record. The logical conclusion, therefore... ...is that the brothers were working with an accomplice! An accomplice who was carrying a gun! Leads to: \"...An accomplice, you say?\"It's nothing to do with them Ryunosuke: I believe...it has nothing to do with them. Nash: Eh? Ringo: Eh, Nash, eh! That's right! Nash: Yeah! Nuffin' to do wiv us, guv! Ryunosuke: We've established that one bullet was fired from each of the two guns already known to the court. The logical conclusion therefore, is that on the night in question at Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery... ...there was another person present in possession of a third firearm. Van Zieks: ...! Ryunosuke: Whilst the brothers may have had nothing to do with the third gun or the bullet fired from it... ...it's inconceivable that they had nothing to do with the third man. Yes! The brothers were working with an accomplice! An accomplice who was carrying a gun! Leads to: \"...An accomplice, you say?\"Van Zieks: ...An accomplice, you say? Pigswill.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: These protracted proceedings have already forced us to endure two summation examinations. Yet in all that time, there has been not a murmur of a third man. If this apparently wraithlike being exists... ...the court must be shown hard evidence! Without it, this fantasy will be crushed.Ryunosuke: Agh!Van Zieks: The prosecution demands answers on two counts: Firstly: proof - evidence - that this accomplice was ever at the scene of the crime. And secondly... ...the identity of this spurious character.Ryunosuke: (The Skulkins are lying. I know that. But... ...how can I ascertain the identity of the person they're hiding?)Judge: Well, Counsel?Ryunosuke: ......... (I'm supposed to prove the existence of this accomplice... and reveal the person's identity, even...) In response to the prosecution's demands, My Lord, the defence is...Ready to present answers Ryunosuke: The defence is ready. I believe I can provide all the answers the prosecution demands. Van Zieks: So, my Nipponese friend, despite the swimming eyes, you seem to think you have something to say. This promises to be interesting. Ryunosuke: (I have to push forward now. There's no other option. I need to use every single piece of evidence available to me if it will make a difference...) Leads to: \"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Unable to present answers Ryunosuke: The defence is... ......... Van Zieks: Unable to complete a sentence, it would seem. Much less provide any credible answers here. Judge: Yes, it would appear so. Very well, this trial will now- Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Wait! Please! Judge: Good gracious, Counsel! Ryunosuke: (I have to keep the momentum going here. I can't give up now!) Iris: This is just like scientific research if you ask me. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: When you start doubting yourself and thinking you can't possibly work something out, you become blind. Even though in truth, the answer you're looking for is right there in front of you. Ryunosuke: (The answer...is right here in front of me!) ...My Lord! Actually...the defence would like to present answers to the questions posed by the prosecution. Van Zieks: Van Zieks: So, my Nipponese friend, despite the swimming eyes, you seem to think you have something to say. But your earlier tongue-tied display will not go unpunished. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (Now I wish I'd bit my tongue instead of speaking before I'd made up my mind. It would have hurt less.) Leads to: \"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Judge: In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay. On the night in question, in the moments leading up to the death of the victim... ...what proof have you that there was a third intruder present at the scene?Present Blood Samples Portfolio Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The evidence is right here...in this portfolio.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The evidence...is this! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: My learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Ryunosuke: The evidence is right here...in this portfolio.Judge: By Jove! That portfolio again, is it?Van Zieks: Do you expect the court to rifle through your papers itself? Be more specific!Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: You claim one of those blood samples proves the presence of this third intruder. Well, which one is it?Present Windibank's Main Shop sample Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"What am I looking at here?\"Present any other sample Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: THIS is the blood sample that proves it! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"You claim one of those blood samples proves the presence of this third intruder.\"Judge: What am I looking at here? There appears to be some green paint or suchlike around the bullet hole in the middle of the calendar.Ryunosuke: That's a bloodstain, My Lord.Judge: A bloodstain?Van Zieks: Green blood? Curious, even for you. Is the court to understand that the intruder was some unhuman creature?Ryunosuke: It's...something developed by Mr Herlock Sholmes.Juror No. 3: By the great detective!Juror No. 5: New invention! Stop. Not yet appeared in stories! Stop.Iris: It's this, you see. It...doesn't have a name yet, though. This fogger sprays a chemical that reacts with the different elements in people's blood to change its colour.Judge: Different elements...of people's blood...?Iris: Yes. Everyone's blood is slightly different, you see. Because it's made up of different elements. So by seeing what colour it changes to, you can tell in a flash whose blood it is!Juror No. 3: Ooh! That brings a whole extra dimension to looking at blood!Juror No. 5: Talk of blood in courtroom! Stop. Very exciting! Stop.Ryunosuke: As an example, this one shows the blood of the victim, Mr Windibank.Judge: Ah... A striking blue.Ryunosuke: Yes. So you see, the green colour of this bloodstain on the calendar... ...shows that somebody else was shot in the main part of the shop!Juror No. 1: Now hold fire there, young man! Could be from some unrelated incident, couldn't it?Ryunosuke: No. It's not unrelated.Juror No. 1: ...!Ryunosuke: The date showing on the calendar is the date on which Mr Windibank was killed.Juror No. 1: By golly!Ryunosuke: Therefore we can assume that whoever was shot, was shot on the same day.Juror No. 4: Then whose blood is it?!Ryunosuke: Well, the Skulkin brothers in the stand don't appear to be suffering from any gunshot injuries... Which means it must be the blood of somebody else. The third intruder, in fact.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Whose identity the court is still waiting to hear. You can't delay this any longer, my learned friend. Who is this alleged third intruder?Present Eggert Benedict profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The man's name...is Eggert Benedict.\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: There can be no doubt! THIS is the shadowy accomplice the brothers have been trying so hard to protect! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: A lottery? Is that how you decide who's guilty? Ryunosuke: Hm? Van Zieks: In that case, the name Ryunosuke Naruhodo should be added to the draw. For being guilty of incompetence! Ryunosuke: GAAAAAAGH! (...And I bet my lot would be drawn, too.) Iris: The identity of this accomplice is our trump card, Runo.  Ryunosuke: Yes...I, I expect it is... Iris: At this point, we're the only ones who know the person's identity. But it's time to stun the courtroom now! Let's give everyone something to think about! Ryunosuke: Yes... YES! Leads back to: \"You can't delay this any longer, my learned friend.\"!Ryunosuke: The man's name...is Eggert Benedict.Judge: Eggert Benedict?! Who on earth are you talking about, Counsel?Ryunosuke: He paid a visit to Windibank's pawnbrokery on the afternoon before the incident took place.Van Zieks: When the accused attempted to deceive the pawnbroker into releasing this article into her possession.Ryunosuke: ...That's right.Van Zieks: ...!Ryunosuke: The man identified by the defence, Mr Eggert Benedict... ...then attempted to take the article from the defendant by force.???: Broker!Windibank: Um, yes, sir????: I believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemed an article from you, no?Windibank: Yes, yes, erm...???: The article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once.Gina: Now that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull????: Give me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box disks, too.Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson was there at the time, and can attest to what happened. In the end, it was the inspector himself who took the disk.Judge: Can you corroborate this account, Inspector?Gregson: Erm, yes, My Lord. That's more or less what happened. And in the interests of bein' thorough, I asked Windibank for a print showin' the fellow. Taken from one of his 'Red-Handed Recorder' gubbinses.Ryunosuke: (Yes! That's him talking to Mr Windibank that morning.)Judge: And you claim this man is the brothers' accomplice?Ryunosuke: Well, Mr and Mr Skulkin?Nash: ......... Never seen the geezer before in me life!Ringo: On me life, guv, on me life! Never seen 'im!Judge: Well...somewhat unsurprisingly, it appears our witnesses disagree with the assertion.Van Zieks: I'm sure Your Lordship recalls my learned Nipponese friend's actual assertion. Which was that he could prove the identity of the alleged accomplice.Ryunosuke: Yes, and I can!Juror No. 3: Then show us the evidence!Juror No. 2: I agree! We must see proof that the clean-cut gentleman in the photograph is the filthy criminal you say he is!Ryunosuke: ......... (This is the last piece of evidence... I've had a feeling that something has been missing in this trial from the very start. But now...I'm going to drag it kicking and screaming into the courtroom!)Judge: Are you ready to present your answer to the court then, Counsel?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. The defence will present the evidence now. Proof that the man pictured in this photographic print was in fact the person struck by the third bullet!Present Music Box Disk (after examining bloodstain during trial) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question...\"Present Blood Samples Portfolio Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That proof is right here, in this portfolio! Judge: Good gracious, Counsel! Does that portfolio contain the answers to every question posed? Van Zieks: ...I see you share my interest in claret-coloured liquids, my Nipponese friend. But... Enough. The court demands to see further evidence. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Which blood sample proves the man you identified was the one shot by the third bullet at the scene of the crime? Present Music Box Disk sample Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question...\" Present any other sample Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: THIS is the blood sample that proves it! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! (It has to be a sample that links the bloodstain at the scene to Mr Benedict...) Iris: In other words, we need a sample of blood that turned the same colour as that bloodstain. Ryunosuke: (Another green sample? ...Did we have one of those?) Iris: I think perhaps you should have another look through everything, Runo. Ryunosuke: Right. I might need to go over the evidence again. (Where else did we notice a bloodstain?) Leads back to: \"Enough. The court demands to see further evidence.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Here it is! This is the irrefutable evidence! Judge: I'm sorry, Counsel, but I fail to see the connection. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: It seems my learned friend is wide of the mark...again. In fact...he has just shot himself in the foot! Ryunosuke: GYAAAAAAGH! (I'll have to try that one more time. Even though my foot is killing me here...) Judge: I might remind you, Counsel, of the gravity of the choices you make in this courtroom. Think very carefully. Leads back to: \".........\"Ryunosuke: As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question... ...the defendant attempted - deceitfully, admittedly - to reclaim this disk from Windibank's.Judge: Which is when the aforementioned Eggert Benedict appeared on the scene, I believe. This man then attempted to purloin the article from the defendant's possession, no?Ryunosuke: That's correct, My Lord. I myself was present at the time. It was following this that a minor incident occurred.Windibank: But of course, sir. Here is the disk for you.Benedict: ......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style.Gina: Wait a minute! That disk... ...is mine!Benedict: Argh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal!Ryunosuke: Being a music box disk, it has countless small but sharp metal protrusions over its surface. Those protrusions caused Mr Benedict's finger to bleed. And the resulting smear of blood is still visible on the disk now.Judge: Goodness! A bloodstain, is it?Ryunosuke: My assistant and I have just analysed the bloodstain here in this very courtroom.Iris: Using...my trusty fogger gun!Ryunosuke: Yes. And we added the results to this portfolio.Juror No. 1:I say!Juror No. 2:It's green!Juror No. 5:It's exactly the same colour as the blood around the calendar!Ryunosuke: The evidence is conclusive! The man calling himself Mr Eggert Benedict, who was in Windibank's earlier in the day... ...is the accomplice who was present at the scene of the crime that same night!So there was someone else there! Look at those two brothers now! They're sweating buckets!Oi! Who are you talkin' about? ...It's boilin' in 'ere!Ryunosuke: My Lord! It is the opinion of the defence... ...that Mr Eggert Benedict...should be summoned to the courtroom to testify!Judge: Hmmm... It would certainly seem that we can ill afford to ignore this gentleman's apparent presence.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ...This has gone on long enough now. This flagrant ignorance of the mechanics of law.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: Herlock Sholmes, you say? Yes, I've heard the name. The protagonist in a series of short stories for the vulgar classes. A god of detection or some such.Iris: ...!Van Zieks: And now you employ chemical substances devised by this fantastical persona in the highest court in the land? Do you expect us to take you seriously? The samples made by this plaything are not fit to be called evidence.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: So the bloodstain turned a shade of green. What of it? Here's to you successfully proving that no other blood in the world would turn the same colour.Ryunosuke: Ah...well...Van Zieks: And pray, do not even think of suggesting that we should take Mr Sholmes's word for it!Ryunosuke: Ugh...Is he right? Is Mr Sholmes's concoction a load of rubbish? I don't know... I mean, he is a great detective.What are you talking about?! We can't let him get away with that!Ryunosuke: ......... (I knew it would come to this. Of course Mr Sholmes's invention isn't going to be recognised by any official body. But...what other choice did I have...?)Iris: Hm... I'm just remembering what Father Christmas over there said before. About how he was temporarily suspending the summation examination.Ryunosuke: Ah!Iris: In other words... ...the examination isn't over yet, is it?Judge: G-Good grief! What did you just say, young girl?Iris: And in a summation examination, the decision as to whether or not the trial continues... ...is in the hands of the six jurors, isn't it?Van Zieks: ...!Iris: So the way I see it... ...it doesn't matter what certain other people think of Hurley's invention. At least, not for now!Ryunosuke: Yes! (She's right!)Judge: Young lady, you have quite the devious mind!Iris: It really just comes down to one thing: Whether these ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...are convinced by what you say, Runo! ...Is that about right, would you say? Or did I misunderstand something?Ryunosuke: (Unbelievable! Mr Sholmes's partner is a force to be reckoned with!)Iris: Iris Wilson...sharpshooter!Judge: After that shrewd precis of the situation from an entirely unexpected source... ...it must be acknowledged that the previous summation examination has yet to reach its conclusion.Van Zieks: This is absurd!Judge: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the court now looks to you for your final leanings in this matter.Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Judge: As proud citizens of Her Majesty's Britain, I'm sure you will come to fair and just conclusions.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Judge: So then, state your final decisions in turn, please.Juror No. 1: Not guilty!Juror No. 2: Not guilty!Juror No. 3: Not guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Not guilty!Judge: Two call guilty, and four call not guilty. Such is the outcome of the summation examination.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: My Lord, with all due respect, this is an outrage! The prosecution refuses to accept this decision!Judge: ...On what grounds?Van Zieks: If these jurors are persuaded by some half-baked concoction devised by a pretender to real police work... ...then they are too ignorant to be trusted with the judgement of anyone's guilt.Judge: I'm sorry, Lord van Zieks, but the outcome of the summation examination cannot be ignored. This trial will continue!Van Zieks: Agk......... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge: ...Nevertheless, we find ourselves in a rather awkward situation. The defence has very reasonably requested the subpoena of a new witness. But sadly, I fear that will be impossible.Ryunosuke: What?Judge: The name the gentleman gave for himself - Eggert Benedict - is quite clearly false.Ryunosuke: (I don't believe it! Just when I'd managed to prove the man was there that night...)???:...Um... Could, could I say something?Judge: ...? Who was that, please? Who spoke?Juror No. 5: Um...it was me, My Lord.Ryunosuke: (Juror number five...?)Judge: What have you to say, madam?Juror No. 5: If possible...Inspector...Gregson: Eh? ...Me, ma'am?Juror No. 5: I wonder if you might show the photographic print to me again? The one in which the gentleman is shown.Gregson: Ah, right, yes. This one, you mean? Of Mr Benedict?Juror No. 5: ......... ......... .........Yes... There's no doubt in my mind.Ryunosuke: Juror number five, you don't mean to say... You know this man?Juror No. 5: Yes, I know him.Ryunosuke: What?!Van Zieks: No!Judge: GOOD GRACIOUS!!! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Juror number five! How on earth...?Juror No. 5: I am a communications officer. Stop.Ryunosuke: ...As we can clearly see...Juror No. 5: The gentleman in the photograph is... Stop. ...also a communications officer. Stop. He works in my office. Stop. A very talented operator in fact! Stop. He should be in the communication station now. Stop. Tapping away on the telegraph. Stop.Ryunosuke: (This doesn't seem right somehow... I can't put my finger on why, but...it doesn't feel right.)Iris: Hm... I suppose we all imagined the accomplice would be some sort of hardened criminal. It's...a bit unexpected to find out that he has a respectable job by day, whatever he gets up to at night.Ryunosuke: Yes...I suppose that's it. (I suppose that's why I felt something was wrong...)Judge: If the gentleman is at London's communication station, we should be able to subpoena him within the hour. Lord van Zieks, if you please...Van Zieks: ...Yes, My Lord?Judge: Make the necessary arrangements with all haste!Van Zieks: As Your Lordship bids.Judge: The court will recess for one hour. When the new witness arrives, we shall reconvene to hear the gentleman's testimony. Inspector Gregson...Gregson: Yes, My Lord?Judge: I should like to hear from you specifically about events at the pawnbrokery on the day in question. Come to my chambers during the recess.Gregson: Yes, sir, My Lord.Judge: Very well... Court is adjourned until 1:40 p.m.!To be continued...17th April, 12:41 p.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberRyunosuke: Ah, Gina. How are you holding up?Gina: .........Ryunosuke: (I'm starting to feel quite warmly towards her frequent cold shoulders now.)Iris: Ginny! Are you alright? Why aren't you saying anything?Gina: ......... Wot's the point, eh? Why go to all this trouble an' fight so 'ard...for the likes o' me?Iris: What?Gina: Well you saw it! That picture.Ryunosuke: What picture?Iris: Ah, you mean this? The photograph taken by Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder. Well, I didn't think it would have captured a scene like this, that's for sure!Gina: It's 'opeless. Anyone who sees that's gonna think I did it, ain't they?Ryunosuke: Well...I won't pretend it wasn't a bit of a shock when the prosecution first presented it to the court.Gina: Surely you've gotta 'ave yer doubts about me now. Ya can't still think I'm innocent.Ryunosuke: ......... Of course I can.Gina: Hmph.........Iris: Ginny...why don't you talk to us? Tell us what really happened that night.Gina: Eh?Iris: Runo's cleverly managed to piece together a lot of new information, but still... ...we'd really like to hear it from you.Gina: ......... Alright then. It was after we'd 'ad that dinner together at your place, right, Iris? Then we all 'ad a chat up in your office, didn't we?Ryunosuke: Yes, I remember.Gina: After that, I just couldn't get to sleep. So I slipped out an' went down the street to the two-to-one. To Windibank's place. ...I 'ad to know.Ryunosuke: If Iris's story was there or not? 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.Gina: I dunno wot it's about or nuffin'... ...but if you ask me, there's somefin' in it that Sholmes don't like. Somefin' wot 'e don't want people readin'. So that's why 'e lied to Iris about stickin' it in lug wiv Windibank for safekeepin'. At least, that's wot I thought at the time.Ryunosuke: So you broke into Windibank's?Gina: I just 'ad to know if it was there or not. I mean, I 'ad no idea all o' that was gonna kick off, did I? I struck the lock and snuck inside. It was dark as you like in there. So I gave the oil lamp on the counter a bit o' wick. And that's when...What d'you think you're doing?!AAAAAAGH!Gina: I nearly died, I did! And the next thing I knew... ...I'd grabbed the gun off the counter and was wavin' it in the air like...I dunno wot.Ah...you're the girl who was in here this afternoon. I didn't think pickpockets went in for armed robbery.The, the mantelscript... 'Ave you got it 'ere? Did Sholmes leave a load o' papers wiv you? A story.Windibank:I beg your pardon?Gina:'The Hound o' the...' somefin'-or-other. If it's 'ere, I wanna see it!Windibank:I'm sorry, young lady... ...but I'd sooner die than relinquish an article belonging to one of my customers.Gina:I don't want it! Wot would I do wiv it anyway? I just...wanna see it's 'ere, that's all.Windibank:Oh, you want to see it, do you?Gina:I wanna know if Sholmes really pawned it 'ere or not. Please! Just let me see it an' I'll go.Windibank:......... Oh, very well then. But for pity's sake, stop waving my gun around, would you?Gina: So then the old cove unlocked the storeroom door, and we both went inside. And it was there alright. The mantelscript. Sholmes weren't lyin' after all.Iris: You did all that just to check for me, Ginny?Gina: ...Anyway, then there was a bit of a kick-up out in the main bit o' the shop.Ryunosuke: The Skulkin brothers arriving on the scene, yes.Gina:Wot was that noise? Someone's breakin' in!Windibank:Dear me, is there some burglars' convention here tonight that I don't know about?Gina:...I think I forgot to shut the door be'ind me. Sorry.Windibank:I'd better go and take care of it. Could I possibly have my gun back?Gina:Oh, well I'll come wiv ya and-Windibank:Now don't be foolish, young girl. You must stay right here. Don't leave this room under any circumstances.Gina: An' wiv that, 'e took the gun out of me 'ands and walked back out into the shop. I 'ung back in the storeroom like 'e said, strainin' me ears in the dark to 'ear wot was goin' on. It sounded like they got into a bit of a scrap. I started to think I should 'elp, see. So I was just about to go out the storeroom myself, when...*BANG!**BANG!*Gina: I 'eard a couple o' shots go off. Two, I think. Almost at the same time. And then there 'e was, right at me feet. Lyin' face down on the floor! I was right next to the storeroom door, so I slammed it shut an' locked it quick as ya like.Ryunosuke: Because you thought whoever had shot Mr Windibank might come for you?Gina: Yeah. So I went to grab the old cove's gun. I figured I'd put up a fight at least. But when I got a better look at 'im, I knew... ...Windibank was a goner. I felt funny in me 'ead all of a sudden. Kind of dizzy. And after that...I don't remember nuffin'.Ryunosuke: That must be when you passed out, Gina.Gina: ......... If...if I 'adn't done wot I done... ...the old cove might still be alive!Ryunosuke: Did you tell the police everything you just told us?Gina: 'Course I did! But they didn't believe a word of it, did they? All they said was, if I kept tellin' lies, it'd make things even worse for me. .........Iris: It'll be alright, Ginny, don't worry. Just stay strong a little longer. Runo's about to put the real culprit through the mill!Gina: ......... That cove wot was there in the afternoon? That Eggert Benedict...I still remember 'ow 'e looked at me. Like I was nuffin'. 'E...'e was there that night.Ryunosuke: We don't know his real name yet... ...but I'm convinced that he's involved somehow.Gina: .........Ryunosuke: Anyway, thank you for telling us what happened, Gina. I appreciate your honesty.Gina: You wot?Iris: You can leave it all in Runo's capable hands now, Ginny!Gina: ......... Mr Narra-'Oddo...Ryunosuke: Yes?Gina: ...'Ow come you trust me? I don't get it.Ryunosuke: .........Gina: I mean, 'ave you forgotten wot 'appened 'ere before? Come on, it was only two months ago. Me and McGilded...we told you a whole pack o' lies. An' you got the bogtrotter off wiv 'em! Even though 'e was a killer!Ryunosuke: ......... No, I could never forget that.Gina: Oh...Ryunosuke: (I did what I thought was best at the time. But the pain of that error of judgement doesn't get any easier to bear.) Still, don't forget that I also made you a promise. I told you that I'd be on your side to the bitter end, no matter what.Gina: But wot if I'm lyin'?! You could be workin' to get another killer off the 'ook for all you know!Ryunosuke: ......... I was once in your position, Gina. I was the accused in a trial.Gina: You were?Ryunosuke: Before I left Japan. I was accused of murder. And strange as it might sound, the circumstances of the crime were pretty damning. I was sure that no one would believe it wasn't me who'd done it.Iris: Oh, Runo...Ryunosuke: But there was one person who stood up for me. Who believed in me, and was prepared to defend me. My best friend.Ryunosuke, no one believes in you more than I do. Leave this to me. All you need to do is put your faith in me, and I'll do the rest!Ryunosuke: I was so happy, I cried. But even then... ...somewhere inside me, I couldn't help thinking: 'Surely he doesn't really believe in me. Not completely.'Gina: ...!Ryunosuke: But...I was wrong.As soon as my trial began, it was obvious... ...that he had an absolute, unwavering belief in me. And in turn, I developed an absolute, unwavering belief in him.Ryunosuke: Since then, I came to realise... ...if you want someone to believe in you, you have to believe in the other person first.Gina: Wot are you sayin'...?Ryunosuke: I promise you, Gina, that no matter what happens, I'll keep believing in you. So you don't need to worry. I won't let you down.Gina: ......... Even though I'm a diver? ...And a no-good liar?Ryunosuke: ......... You're not like McGilded. I know that.Gina: Eh?Iris: That's right! You're our friend, Ginny!Gina: I-Iris!Ryunosuke: We know you better than you think. And we've come to the conclusion that you're someone we can trust.Iris: Yes!Ryunosuke: That's really all we need to know.Iris: Exactly!Gina: Um...Mr Narra-'Oddo, I, um... I... *Sniffle, sniffle*Bailiff: Defendant Gina Lestrade and her legal representative! Court proceedings are about to resume. Please head into the courtroom immediately!Ryunosuke: Yes, of course! Thank you.I'd been both a defendant and a defending lawyer in my time. So I knew only too well... ...just how hard it was to put all your faith in another. And I also knew... ...just how hard it was to bear the burden of another putting all their faith in you. (This is it at last. The final chapter. The final battle. Wish me luck, Susato-san... And I hope you're watching over me too...partner!)17th April, 1:41 p.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: I hereby call this court to order as we resume the trial of Miss Gina Lestrade. Lord van Zieks, have you successfully subpoenaed the witness?Van Zieks: The subpoena was delivered to the communication station where the man works immediately, My Lord. However, the heavy rain has delayed the arrival of his carriage, it would seem.Judge: Hm, I see. Then let us turn our attention to Inspector Gregson's precis of the case heard by the court this morning. The glaring omission of the third bullet in your report is a serious blunder, Inspector.Gregson: Yes, um, I can only apologise, My Lord.Judge: And although the defence's chemical analysis of the blood at the scene makes for a compelling argument... ...I cannot permit such untried methods to be used as evidence in my courtroom.Iris: Hmph! It's a big mistake to cross Hurley and me. A very big mistake!Bailiff: My Lord! The subpoenaed witness has just arrived in the building.Judge: Thank you, Officer. Show him to the stand without delay.Ryunosuke: (Mr Eggert Benedict... I didn't expect to be crossing paths with him again so soon. And certainly not like this.)Judge: Thank you for complying with the court's subpoena at such short notice, sir.???: But of course, My Lord. As an upstanding member of London society, it is my pleasure to oblige.Judge: Now, kindly state your name and occupation for the record.Graydon: Ashley Graydon, communications officer.Juror No. 5: Mr Graydon and I both work at London's central communication station.Graydon: Now perhaps somebody would kindly explain what all this is about?Van Zieks: You were apprised of the situation by the court officer on your way here, I presume.Graydon: Yes, I was. Something to do with a murder that took place at a pawnbroker's on Baker Street. And some nonsense about me having been there on the night in question.Van Zieks: That is the accusation, indeed.Graydon: This really is beyond a joke, you know.Judge: Very well. Without further delay, the court will hear your testimony now, Mr Graydon. You will respond to the accusation made against you under oath.Graydon: Gladly, My Lord. Gladly.Witness Testimony - The Accusation -Graydon: Naturally, I have occasion to make use of pawnbroking services from time to time. But are you seriously suggesting I colluded with these thugs to break into the place on the night of the murder? ...I have no intention of admitting to such an outrageous accusation. Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene. Some scaramouch detective's homebrewed tincture can hardly be taken as serious evidence.Judge: So...you deny the accusation completely, do you?Graydon: I must say, I am dismayed. For the highest court in the land to be swayed by this self-professed detective's toy...Van Zieks: It was the will of the jury. And our great British justice system demands that the jury's will is upheld.Graydon: Then it would seem we have the misfortune of a most inept assembly of jurors today.Juror No. 1: ...! By golly!Graydon: How long am I expected to be detained here?Judge: If, following the defence's cross-examination, your involvement in this matter has not been established... ...you will be free to leave immediately.Graydon: Good. Then I shall be away in time for afternoon tea. Some small consolation at least.Judge: Let us not hold up Mr Graydon any longer than necessary, Counsel. Proceed with the cross-examination.Ryunosuke: So...we meet again, Mr Eggert Benedict. Or is it Mr Graydon?Graydon: ......... My apologies. You are...?Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke Naruhodo, defence lawyer. We have met.Graydon: If you say so. Ashley Graydon. Enchanté. So...Ryunosuke: Agh!Graydon: ...I trust we can conclude this quickly.Ryunosuke: Ugh... (But I'm NOT holding your flashy hat while we do.)Cross-Examination - The Accusation -Graydon: Naturally, I have occasion to make use of pawnbroking services from time to time.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Yes, we even met in the very pawnbrokery where the crime took place on the afternoon of the day in question. Though of course...you introduced yourself by a different name at the time. Graydon: ...! Ryunosuke: It was Mr Eggert Benedict, I believe. Tell me, what made you- Van Zieks: Van Zieks: The witness is here to testify about events that took place that night. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: He is under no obligation to answer such unrelated questions. Ryunosuke: You can't be serious! Graydon: ...Thank you. Because I certainly do not feel inclined to answer such an inappropriate question. Ryunosuke: (So he's going to be evasive, is he? In an effort not to give anything away. This could be tricky...) Graydon: .........Graydon: But are you seriously suggesting I colluded with these thugs to break into the place on the night of the murder?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Have you seen these two men before? Graydon: This pair? ...No. I don't associate with criminals. Ryunosuke: (Said by a man who introduced himself as 'Eggert Benedict'...) Graydon: I'd like to know who I have to thank for this. Who made this outlandish accusation against me? Van Zieks: The young lawyer there in the black. Graydon: This is a farce! Whose idea was it to permit an outsider to work in a British court anyway? Ryunosuke: ...! Graydon: Well, needless to say...Graydon: ...I have no intention of admitting to such an outrageous accusation.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Where were you at around one in the morning on the night in question, sir? Graydon: That is past the hour at which I would normally retire. Certainly... ...I was not in the company of these rapscallions. Ryunosuke: You're able to prove that? Graydon: ......... Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Listen carefully, my learned Nipponese friend... ...for you appear to be under a gross misapprehension on this point. Ryunosuke: What do you mean? Van Zieks: The witness maintains he was not at the scene of the crime. He has no obligation to prove his absence. If your accusation is that the witness was present at the scene... ...the obligation lies with you to prove your assertion. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: You will fulfil that obligation before putting any more unreasonable questions to the witness. Ryunosuke: (A silent victory wiggle. Thanks.)Graydon: Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Blood was found at the scene of the crime. There's no question of that. Mr Sholmes's chemical analysis has positively identified the substance as such. Graydon: But I am not the only human to have blood running through my veins, am I? How can you be sure that the blood is mine? It could equally be the blood of one of these two miscreants. Ryunosuke: Every individual's blood has a slightly different composition, it seems. Mr Sholmes's chemical is able to differentiate different blood samples by- Graydon: Spare me the science lesson! ...Who is this Sholmes character anyway? Ryunosuke: Oh. I, I assumed all Londoners would know the name. He's a grea- Well, a renowned detective. Van Zieks: So, even you are unable to bring yourself to say 'great detective'. Graydon: A great detective, you say? Tsk! Now we're in the realm of fairy tales, are we? The counsel for the defence thinks a British courtroom is an appropriate place for fairy tales, does he? Pursue Nash Skulkin Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to say about that, Mr Skulkin? Ringo: Eh? Wot? Me? Ryunosuke: ...No, the Mr Skulkin next to you. Gregson: Right, I've had it up to here with this! How many times have I gotta tell you? Ryunosuke: Yes, I know. You're not 'Big Bruv Sulky'. Mr Nash Skulkin! Nash: Eh? Cor blimey, guvnor! You wot?! Ryunosuke: Is it not the case that when Mr Graydon just spoke, a thought went through your mind? Would you care to share that thought with the court? Nash: Eh? Me thoughts? I dun 'ave none o' them! It must've been 'im! Ringo: You wot?! Ryunosuke: Mr Nash Skulkin! ...Answer the question, please. What went through your mind when Mr Graydon just spoke? Nash: Nuffin'! Honest, guv! Nuffin'! I, I woz just thinkin'... ...if 'e waves 'is arm around like that much more, it'll open up the wound again, that's all! Ryunosuke: What wound? Nash: Where 'e took the bullet, o' course! It woz only two days ago. It ain't gonna be 'ealed up yet! So I woz, um... Well, ya know... I woz worryin' for 'im, and... ......... Oh, 'ell's bells! Ryunosuke: Mr Graydon! Did you hear that? Graydon: What? Ryunosuke: Your comrade is worried about you, it seems. ...On account of your injured arm. Graydon: ......... My Lord. Judge: Yes, Mr Graydon? Graydon: I have no idea what these two wretches are talking about. Certainly, I shouldn't be expected to answer anything in relation to their mindless insinuations. Judge: Hmmm... Ryunosuke: We know that someone other than the victim was hit by a bullet at the scene of the crime two nights ago. And from the height of the bullet hole in the wall, that person was likely hit in the upper arm or thereabouts. Graydon: ......... Ryunosuke: Perhaps you'd allow a court official to examine your arm, sir? The left arm that you're currently clasping with your right hand, as if in pain! Graydon: ......... No. ...I refuse. Ryunosuke: ...! Graydon: You have shown no evidence whatsoever that links me to these common thieves. Accordingly, I am not obliged to permit any such invasion of my privacy! As I've already said, I'm completely uninvolved in all this. I've never had anything to do with the pawnbrokery where this fellow was killed whatsoever! I take offence at the insinuation that I was in any way involved! Judge: Hm...you claim to have had nothing whatsoever to do with Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery? Ryunosuke: My Lord! The defence would like that last statement to be added to Mr Graydon's formal testimony. Judge: Very well, Counsel. Continue with your testimony, My Graydon. Graydon: ......... Removes statement \"Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene.\" Adds statement \"The bottom line is, I've never had anything to do with the pawnbroking establishment where the man was killed!\" Ryunosuke: Ugh... Iris: Argh! This is so unfair! That chemical test is based on solid science! Hurley and I know what we're doing! Ryunosuke: The trouble is, unless the technique can be independently verified... ...we'll never get beyond this man's flashy stick-waving. Graydon: Granted, it is a very colourful alchemy. Perhaps it would make a good souvenir for your uneducated friends back home in the East. Ryunosuke: (Something riled him there. Just for a moment, Mr Graydon let his feathers get ruffled...) Graydon: But a souvenir is all it's good for.Graydon: Some scaramouch detective's homebrewed tincture can hardly be taken as serious evidence.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Don't forget, sir, that Mr Herlock Sholmes is the most famous detective in the world. Graydon: And the most famous detective in the world tells the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, hm? Ryunosuke: Erm, well, um... (Oh no! I can't think how to answer that!) Van Zieks: I once saw the world's most famous swindler thrown into jail. He allegedly told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but...what turned out to be a pack of lies. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Graydon: Quite. Now... ...as you are no doubt aware, the central communication station is the heart of this country's information network. My work there is of paramount importance. And you have kept me from it for long enough already.Graydon: The bottom line is, I've never had anything to do with the pawnbroking establishment where the man was killed!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Never had anything to do with it? You forget that I was there, Mr Graydon! On the very afternoon of the incident! Graydon: ...Obviously, I am not a complete stranger to the pawnbroker's. I'm currently on the lookout for an armchair to furnish my study. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: No! You were there to redeem an article! Graydon: I have no idea what you're talking about. Pursue Tobias Gregson Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to add, Inspector? Gregson: Eh? Come again, sunshine? Ryunosuke: You were there, too, in fact, weren't you, Inspector? That afternoon. Gregson: ......... Well yes, I do remember meetin' yourself in the pawnbroker's that afternoon. You, your young Japanese assistant, and the accused were all present, as I recall. Ryunosuke: And at that time, this witness, Mr Graydon, was trying to acquire a particular article... Gregson: Um...well now... Ryunosuke: ...! Gregson: I'm afraid I don't remember too clearly. Ryunosuke: What?! But, but you must! Gregson: I'm not going to lie and pretend I remember somethin' that I don't. Ryunosuke: ...! (What's going on here?) Iris: Gregsy showed us a picture before, didn't he? You know, from the cameras that Hurley installed in Windibank's. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, of course. Judge: Indeed. And the gentleman pictured bears a striking resemblance to the witness, I must say. Ryunosuke: Exactly! Which proves that Mr Graydon was in the shop on the afternoon in question! Graydon: At no point have I denied that fact. Ryunosuke: ...! Graydon: I merely entered the shop to peruse the articles on sale and have a word with the broker. Nothing more. Gregson: ......... Ryunosuke: (This makes no sense. I understand why Mr Graydon might be trying to cover his tracks... ...but why would Gregson be trying to avoid giving testimony about what happened?) Leads back to cross-examination Ryunosuke: Sorry? Graydon: You must be confusing me with somebody else. I wasn't there for any such purpose. Ryunosuke: But, but the redemption article! Iris: That won't get you anywhere, Runo. Ryunosuke: Iris! ...What do you mean? Iris: Mr Windibank never wrote the names of his customers on his redemption tickets. So you can't prove the ticket was his. Ryunosuke: Ah! (Of course... She's right.) Iris: I'm afraid... ...you're going to need to produce some irrefutable evidence here. Otherwise he'll never admit to being there. Ryunosuke: Hm...irrefutable evidence...Present Music Box Disk Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Have you ever seen this disk before, Mr Graydon?\"Before correctly pursuing Nash Skulkin Ryunosuke: (That's all he's going to say on the matter, is it?) Iris: What do you think, Runo? Ryunosuke: I think he has no intention of telling us anything. He's well aware that the less he says, the less chance he has of giving himself away. Iris: Hm... The complete opposite of Hurley, then. He seems to think that the more he says, the better. Ryunosuke: I need to find a way of getting more information out of this man somehow... (But compared to the bungling burglars beside him, he seems as innocent as a child.) Iris: Or perhaps the Skulkin brothers might be the key here? Ryunosuke: Oh... (Could they be somehow...?) Iris: Remember, if you don't prove this witness has some connection to the incident here, he'll be free to leave. Ryunosuke: I know. I can't let that happen. (Let's listen to those statements again and see if there's any way I can make one of them tell us more.)After correctly pursuing Nash Skulkin Ryunosuke: (That's all he's going to say on the matter, is it?) Iris: What do you think, Runo? Ryunosuke: I think he has no intention of telling us anything. He's well aware that the less he says, the less chance he has of giving himself away. Iris: Hm... The complete opposite of Hurley, then. He seems to think that the more he says, the better. Ryunosuke: Well, at least I managed to prise a little more information from these witnesses' lips. All thanks to the Skulkin brothers... Iris: Yes! They were the key to it after all! Ryunosuke: So he says he had nothing to do with Windibank's... (Well, we know that's not true.) Iris: Perhaps now would be a good time to have a proper look through the Court Record. Ryunosuke: Good idea. You never know what tiny scrap of information could become a valuable weapon...Ryunosuke: Have you ever seen this disk before, Mr Graydon?Graydon: ......... Why? Is it supposed to mean something?Ryunosuke: This disk was, until the day of his murder, in pawn in Mr Windibank's shop. It was redeemed by the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade that afternoon. However... ...somebody mysteriously appeared to try to take it from her. And that somebody was you, of course. Wasn't it, Mr Graydon?Graydon: As I have reiterated numerous times now...you are mistaken. That was not me. I've never seen that disk before in my life.Ryunosuke: It may have escaped your notice, but there is a small smear of blood on the disk.Judge: Ah yes. Resulting from an abrasion of the thumb, perhaps?Ryunosuke: That's right. The surface of the disk is covered in hundreds of tiny metal bumps. In the skirmish to acquire the disk, the thumb of the person who tried to take it suffered minor lacerations.Graydon: ...!Ryunosuke: So! While the disk bears the remnants of that skirmish in the form of this smear of blood... ...the thumb of the person in question must bear the remnants also. In the form of a scratch!Judge: Good gracious! Indeed it must!Ryunosuke: Mr Graydon!Graydon: ...!Ryunosuke: You refused to allow a court officer to examine your arm before. Are you now going to refuse to allow us to examine your thumb? Because I have no doubt that it bears a small scratch consistent with the smear of blood on this disk!Graydon: ...! ......... Well well... ...it would seem I underestimated you.Judge: What, what is the meaning of this?Ryunosuke: So you admit it now? You admit you have a scratch on your thumb from when you attempted to take the disk from the defendant?!Judge: Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! ...Well, Mr Graydon?Graydon: ...It would appear there has been something of a misunderstanding here. I did not attempt to take the disk, as you put it. No, quite the reverse.Ryunosuke: What are you trying to say?Graydon: It's really quite simple, you see. The disk was mine from the outset. Is there some crime in taking an item that you own out of pawn?Ryunosuke: What?!Van Zieks: It would seem, Mr Graydon... ...that in this piece of evidence, my learned friend has established a link between yourself and the incident. Accordingly...you will tell the court everything you know about this disk now.Graydon: ...As you wish. Though I'm quite sure it has nothing whatsoever to do with the pawnbroker's murder.Witness Testimony - The Disk -Graydon: There's a note on the disk saying, 'For McGilded', but the item belongs to me. The redemption ticket was stolen from me by the accused - that filthy gutterling - on the day in question. I proceeded at once to the shop in order to explain my situation and redeem my article. In the end, of course, the disk was taken by the police. In other words...I had absolutely no reason to break into the shop later that same night.Judge: Did I hear you correctly, sir? 'McGilded', you say? The famous London philanthropist? Who perished in this very courtroom two months ago after being acquitted of a distinctly messy murder?Graydon: Yes, My Lord. The one and the same.Judge: Good Lord! Mr Graydon! Are you saying that Mr McGilded and yourself were acquainted?Graydon: ......... Yes. That's correct.Judge: Ordaaar! ...Well. I certainly didn't expect to hear that name uttered here in my courtroom again.Ryunosuke: (According to what Gina told us, this disk was placed in pawn on that fateful night two months ago. McGilded himself gave instructions to deposit it at Windibank's.)Iris: It's funny that Mr Graydon here is claiming the disk belongs to him then, isn't it?Ryunosuke: In all likelihood, he's lying. (So he appeared that afternoon at Windibank's in order to get his hands on McGilded's disk for some reason...)Judge: Counsel, you will commence your cross-examination, please.Cross-Examination - The Disk -Gina: Truth is, that brickmaker cove was in the cabin o' the omnibus the whole time.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: And you were hiding in the cabin at the time as well, weren't you, Miss Lestrade? If I remember rightly, in the storage compartment underneath one of the seats? Gina: Yeah, that's right. It's pitch-black under there, so ya can't see nuffin' at all. Pursue Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson (if not already pursued; before all statements have been pressed without pursuing) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Is there something you'd like to share with the court, Inspector Gregson and Mr Graydon? ......... Ryunosuke: INSPECTOR!!! MR GRAYDON!!! Gregson: WHA-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Blimey! You tryin' to give me a heart attack? Ryunosuke: You have been whispering to each other for quite some time now. Tell us, what is the discussion about? Gregson: Discussion? With this fella? Pull the other one, sunshine! You think I've got anythin' to talk about with a shady gent like this? Graydon: And I have nothing to say to this uncouth detective after he deprived me of that disk that was rightfully mine. Ryunosuke: (But they've clearly been talking the entire time I've been cross-examining Gina. It's as if they've been negotiating.) Van Zieks: ......... Judge: You will kindly refrain from talking amongst yourselves while the witness is giving testimony. Gregson: Yes, um...sorry, My Lord. Ryunosuke: (What WERE those two talking about?) Judge: Miss Lestrade, continue with your testimony, please. Gina: .........

Ryunosuke: (But they've clearly been talking the entire time I've been cross-examining Gina. It's as if they've been negotiating.) Van Zieks: ......... Leads to: \"Thank you, Miss Lestrade.\" Judge: Now, in your testimony two months ago... ...I feel certain that you claimed Mr McGilded was the sole passenger, did you not? Van Zieks: False testimony, My Lord. Gina: That's...that's wot 'e told me I 'ad to say. Ryunosuke: But it's important that you tell us the truth now. Were Mr McGilded and the victim acquaintances? Gina: I dunno. But I did 'ear 'em talkin' a lot. Ryunosuke: What were they talking about? Gina: Well I couldn't 'ear too well. But if I 'ad to say... ...I think it was about money or somefin'. They kept talkin' about 'buyin'' and 'not buyin''. Judge: Hm, perhaps business dealings of some kind... Gina: Well anyway, they got louder an' louder. It started to sound like a proper fight. I was pretty scared by then. I 'ardly dared to breathe. And then, all of a sudden... ...I 'eard a noise like someone keelin' over on the floor. It was bloomin' loud an' all. Judge: And I believe you let out an involuntary scream? Gina: Yeah. That's wot gave me away.Gina: When the Irishman dragged me out from under the seat, I saw that disk on the floor.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Was the disk you saw this disk? Gina: Yeah...I reckon it probably was. It was right next to the cove lyin' on the floor.

Leads to: \"Thank you, Miss Lestrade.\" Judge: Could this disk have belonged to the victim perhaps? Gina: I dunno, but McGilded picked it up pretty smartish. An' then 'e sat the cove wiv the knife in 'is belly up on the seat. Ryunosuke: What did he say to you at that time? Gina: 'E told me not to say a word about wot I'd seen or 'eard to no one. About the disk an' all. I was dead scared. The way 'e was lookin' at me, I thought... ...if I didn't go along wiv it, I'd get stuck wiv that knife, too. Judge: Hmmm... Gina: Then 'e started askin' me a load o' questions. Like wot me name was an' where I lived an' that. 'E asked me about bein' a diver, too. Ryunosuke: But after a while, what had happened in the carriage was noticed? Gina: Yeah, that's right. First there was a kind of rappin' noise.Gina: All of a sudden, I 'eard a scream from over me 'ead, an' that pair on the roof deck went off to call the slops.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: There were two gentlemen occupying the seats on the roof deck, I believe? Gina: That's right. They must've looked down through the skylight an' noticed the cove wiv the knife in 'is guts. When they screamed, the driver pulled up the 'orses an' McGilded got me out o' sight.

Leads to: \"Thank you, Miss Lestrade.\" Judge: Out of sight? Where? Gina: Back under the seat where I started off. Once the carriage came to an 'alt, the two coves from the roof ran off to fetch the slops. Van Zieks: If they immediately left to fetch the police, it would appear they were entirely unrelated to the incident. Judge: Hmmm... Ryunosuke: So that left McGilded, the driver and you still at the scene. Gina: Yeah. Only the driver didn't know I was there cos I was under the seat. I 'eard the cabin door open, an' a voice from outside. Judge: The driver, yes... He also testified in the trial, I believe. A fellow who went by the name of Beppo, if memory serves. Ryunosuke: What did McGilded and the driver say to each other? Gina: 'I dunno wot 'appened,' an' stuff like that mainly.Gina: That's when McGilded slipped the driver some tin to do a run to the pawn shop round about.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That pawn shop obviously being Windibank's on Baker Street. Judge: Ju-Just a moment, Counsel! Do, do you mean to tell me... ...that the driver gave false testimony in that trial as well?! Van Zieks: Perhaps the excursion to the pawnbrokery slipped his mind when he was in the stand. Judge: Indeed, Lord van Zieks! Gina: McGilded took off 'is coat an' gave it to the driver. 'E folded it up, all careful like, before 'andin' it over. When I saw 'im do that, I remember thinkin'... ...that coat an' wot's in it 'as gotta be worth a few bob.

I remember her quibbling with him over the price that afternoon at the pawnbrokery.) Gina: The driver looked pretty 'appy when McGilded flashed some brass in 'is face. 'E went runnin' off at a lick. Then the bogtrotter called to me and told me to come out from the drag's cabin.Gina: ...He threatened me not to snitch. Not to say nuffin' to no one about wot I'd seen or 'eard.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Threatened you how exactly? Gina: Told me I'd only be able to scarper if I did exactly wot 'e said.

Leads to: \"Thank you, Miss Lestrade.\" Van Zieks: Which included giving false testimony in court two months ago? Gina: Yeah, that's it. And there was one other thing 'e said. Van Zieks: Which was? Gina: 'E told me I'd 'ave to 'ang on to the ticket from the pawn shop. An' make sure not to lose it. Judge: The ticket...? Well I never! Gina: Said that if 'e didn't show up to get the ticket off me before two months passed... ...I 'ad to go to the pawn shop and pay the money to keep it in lug. To stop it bein' forfeited. 'E left me wiv some brass to pay for it. Judge: But really... ...why on earth would Mr McGilded have done such a thing? Depositing his overcoat with a pawnbroker before the arrival of the police... It makes no sense at all. Ryunosuke: There would seem to be only one logical explanation, My Lord. What McGilded had the driver deposit at Windibank's was something he didn't want the police to see. Something very important, that he needed to hide at all costs. Judge: ...! Gina: Anyway...after that, 'e let me go. So I legged it before the coppers showed up.Before pursuing Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson Ryunosuke: (Well done, Gina. It can't have been easy to tell the truth like that.) Iris: Ginny's really put her faith in you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Yes, and to thank her, she'll have to face a charge of perjury once this trial's over. (So I need to use the time we have now to get as much information out of her as possible.) Iris: It's time to really go for it! Press her on every statement! Ryunosuke: I, I suppose I should... Iris: Oh! And another thing... Ryunosuke: What's that? Iris: Take a look at those two. Isn't it strange that they've been whispering to each other the entire time? Ryunosuke: (Yes, that is strange. It looks like they're having a secret discussion about something... I'm not sure if I'm completely comfortable with that. I wonder if there's anything I can do about it...)After pursuing Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson Ryunosuke: (Well done, Gina. It can't have been easy to tell the truth like that.) Iris: Ginny's really put her faith in you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Yes, and to thank her, she'll have to face a charge of perjury once this trial's over. (So I need to use the time we have now to get as much information out of her as possible.) Iris: It's time to really go for it! Press her on every statement!After pressing all statements (without pursuing) and pursuing Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson:Judge: Thank you, Miss Lestrade. Thank you, Counsel. I've heard enough. I believe we now have a reasonable understanding of what actually transpired on the omnibus.Van Zieks: It would appear on that night two months ago, a negotiation was taking place on the omnibus. A negotiation concerning this disk. However, matters did not run smoothly. When the parties involved began to quarrel over price, McGilded took what he wanted by force... ...at the expense of the other man's life.Ryunosuke: Which proves my point! The disk is clearly extremely valuable in some way! (Although I don't understand why as yet.)Van Zieks: And two days ago, precisely two months after the omnibus incident... ...McGilded's coat and its contents were due to be forfeited.Gina: I didn't know wot I should do wiv the ticket. I mean, the cove died right after 'is trial. I knew that.Van Zieks: So you decided you would try to claim the articles as your own.Gina: Well why not, eh? They were only gonna be forfeited! Why shouldn't I 'ave got 'em? Anyway, ya can't blame me for thinkin' about it. Thinkin' ain't no crime!Judge: Miss Lestrade, it would appear Mr McGilded was prepared to kill in order to take possession of this disk. Do you know why that would be?Gina: Eh? I ain't got a clue! But I reckon it must be worth a fair bit o' brass. 'E was probably gonna sell it. An' ya can't blame me for thinkin' that! Thinkin' ain't no crime!Judge: Hmmm...???:My Lord!Bailiff:The evidence Your Lordship requested has been located and is ready for the court's inspection, sir!Ryunosuke: (The mysterious little box, deposited by McGilded two months ago... There's no doubt in my mind that it's a key piece in this far-reaching puzzle!)To be continued...Judge: So this is the article in question, is it? The 'small box' deposited with the pawnbroker by Mr McGilded two months ago.Ryunosuke: ...And on the night of Mr Windibank's murder... ...the only item on the shelves that was touched by whoever broke in to the shop.Iris: Quick, quick! Let's open it and see what's inside!Judge: Good gracious! This is no ordinary box, it seems!Ryunosuke: (Wow! ...Although in truth, I had an inkling that might be the case.)Van Zieks: ...It would appear that the box houses a miniature music box movement.Graydon: .........Judge: Then...is it too much to expect...?Van Zieks: I think it would be reasonable to assume that it is a device for the playback of this disk, My Lord.Judge: So, here we have the means to play back Mr McGilded's disk, deposited at Windibank's at much the same time.Van Zieks: Not strictly correct, My Lord. It was not McGilded's disk. It was the disk of his victim in the omnibus.Judge: But why, for heaven's sake? Are we to understand that the brickmaker was trying to sell this music box disk to Mr McGilded?Ryunosuke: ......... I believe the answer will become clear if we listen to the music on the disk, My Lord.Judge: Yes, very well. Let the court now listen to this curious disk at last.Gregson:Gregson: Wait! ...My Lord!Judge: Good grief! What is the meaning of this, Inspector?Gregson: The music box and the disk are, um... Well they're unrelated to the case! No, no need to spoil the sombre atmosphere in the courtroom with some silly bit o' music...Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: This disk may very well have motivated the culprit in this case to commit murder! Clearly there's every chance that it's fundamentally important to understanding what happened!Van Zieks: The prosecution has no objection.Gregson: But, but no! That piece of evidence is police property now! You can't-Van Zieks: Clearly Scotland Yard has some vested interest here. But it is policy of this prosecutor to leave no avenues unexplored. And you, Inspector, have no jurisdiction here to prevent that from happening.Gregson: GA-AAAAAAAARGH!Judge: No further delays, please. Play the disk!...........................Judge: Wh-What on earth...? That's certainly not what I would call music.Ryunosuke: (No... It's just the same note playing over and over again in an irregular sequence...)Judge: Hmmm...Graydon: Ha ha ha ha ha...Judge: Mr Graydon?Graydon: This, this really is priceless! After all that, the music box is broken!Ryunosuke: Broken?! (It, it can't be, can it?)Graydon: Well obviously! In fact, I wouldn't be surprised... ...if the officer sent to fetch it didn't drop it on the way back to the courtroom.Judge: Well, with much regret... ...I feel the court must accept that this music box offers little in the way of clues.Van Zieks: .........Judge: Are you ready to move on, Counsel?Ryunosuke: (Come on...! Yes, alright, it does sound as though it's completely broken, but...is it?) Could this 'music' emanating from the music box possibly be a new clue?No way Ryunosuke: I agree that it doesn't appear to be relevant, My Lord. Graydon: ......... Ryunosuke: ...What prompted that triumphant wiggle? Graydon: Nothing in particular. Ryunosuke: Really?! Or was it because that 'music' is in fact a very significant clue?! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: You never learn, do you? When you speak, you must mean what you say. ...Or be prepared to suffer the consequences! Ryunosuke: Ugh... Judge: Erm... Am I to understand that you do indeed consider this repetitive monotone to be relevant somehow?  Leads to: \"It's an abomination, Counsel! Mere noise!\"It could be a clue Ryunosuke: I believe that it could be relevant, My Lord. Judge: Good Lord! But, but how can it be? Leads to: \"It's an abomination, Counsel! Mere noise!\"Judge: It's an abomination, Counsel! Mere noise! I fail to see how it can have any meaning whatsoever.Ryunosuke: (It does sound strange, I agree. But there's one thing bothering me... While Graydon stands there chortling victoriously... ...the inspector beside him has a rather telling expression on his face. It's as if Gregson recognises the sound. As if he's familiar with it somehow... And that's making him appear extremely on edge.)Van Zieks: If that's the stance of the defence, my Nipponese friend, answer me this...Ryunosuke: Oh!...........................Van Zieks: Just what relevance do you propose this woeful chiming has on this case?Ryunosuke: ......... It's the defence's belief that the sound emanating from this music box is...Broken Ryunosuke: Clearly the music box is broken in some way! Van Zieks: ......... Graydon: ......... Judge: Counsel... ...I feel you are perhaps floundering in your non-native tongue, but 'broken' is tantamount to irrelevant here. Van Zieks: Indeed. And here's to your own irrelevant noise, my learned friend! Ryunosuke: Naaargh! (The music, or whatever you want to call it, has to be relevant somehow. ...Which might actually be the point!) Van Zieks: Let's see if you grasp the question better next time around... Leads back to: \"...........................\"An unusual genre of music Ryunosuke: It could be an unusual genre of music that none of us are familiar with! Van Zieks: ......... Graydon: ......... Judge: Counsel... ...would you care to elaborate on that remark? Ryunosuke: Well, it...it could be a new style of music that's about to take the world by storm, for example! Judge: I think not, Counsel. Such monotonous nonsense could be pleasing to no one's ear, surely. Van Zieks: Well said, My Lord. And here's to my learned friend seeing that remark's true meaning! Ryunosuke: Naaargh! (The music, or whatever you want to call it, has to be relevant somehow. ...Which might actually be the point!) Van Zieks: Let's see if you grasp the question better next time around... Leads back to: \"...........................\"Not supposed to be music Leads to: \"Just because this is a music box, it doesn't necessarily mean the sounds we're hearing are music.\"Ryunosuke: Just because this is a music box, it doesn't necessarily mean the sounds we're hearing are music.Graydon: ...!Ryunosuke: (Look at that. The smile vanished from Graydon's lips as soon as I said it. I'm on the right lines here. I must be!)Iris: Hehe, making deductions based on how people react to what you say... You're acting just like Hurley, Runo!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: The sounds we're hearing aren't necessarily music? Well, now that you've told us what they are not... ...I'm sure the court would like to hear what they are. Do enlighten us, my Nipponese friend.Ryunosuke: ...! Well, um...Van Zieks: Surely you have an idea in mind? Because if not... ...it will be the death of your ill-formed argument!Graydon: Exactly. The music box is clearly broken. Refusing to accept that fact is pure foolishness!Ryunosuke: (They've got me! I don't know what the answer is...yet!)Iris: Um, Runo... ...I've just examined the music box very thoroughly... ...and I'm fairly certain that it's not broken at all.Ryunosuke: Really?!Iris: Really. The way it's been made, it can only produce a single note anyway.Ryunosuke: Thank you, Iris!(Alright, well if the music box isn't broken... ...it must mean that the sounds it's producing have some significance that isn't musical. ......... Ah! Could it be...? Is that what these sounds are?!)Iris: Something's just struck me, Runo. I feel like recently - in the past few hours even... ...I've heard another sound very much like the one this music box makes.Ryunosuke: ......... (Yes, it's a familiar sound.) Actually, Iris... ...I was just thinking exactly the same thing.Judge: I'm going to have to press the defence for an answer. If your assertion is that the sound produced by this music box is not in fact music at all... ...then what the devil is it, Counsel?Ryunosuke: (All the evidence we've seen so far... All the testimony we've heard... It's all pointing to one single answer now!)Van Zieks: The prosecution demands that my learned Nipponese friend presents proof now! Tangible proof of this latest, wild speculation!Ryunosuke: ......... Alright then. (This could be the best chance I'm going to get to fight back in this trial. And if I'm right, it's going to join all the dots together!) The evidence that explains the true nature of the sounds on this music box disk is...Present Today's Paper (after examining picture on back) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Today's paper, Counsel?\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Obviously it's this! Judge: I'm afraid to say, Counsel... ...that you were being rather optimistic with that leading 'obviously' there. Ryunosuke: ......... If I'm honest, as I thumped my hands down just now... ...I had an inkling that it was going to hurt me more than the bench. Van Zieks: Well. At least one of your 'inklings' was correct, then. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Iris: That arrhythmic tinging sound the music box makes is definitely familiar somehow. Ryunosuke: It's almost like some sort of code... The question is how to show that the tinging sound has a connection to this case. (Perhaps I should have a good look through all the evidence in the Court Record again.) Iris: I'm going to have a good look through the Court Record again too, I think! Leads back to: \"The evidence that explains the true nature of the sounds on this music box disk is...\"Judge: Today's paper, Counsel? The headline is 'Pawnbroker Perishes in Pickpurse Plunder!' ...Hardly supportive of your cause.Ryunosuke: Ah...no, My Lord. I was hoping you'd look a little further down the page...Judge: Further down? 'Ministry Mole? Classified Secrets May Have Been Leaked Overseas From Ministry of Justice'... Yes, this is a very serious matter, being investigated at the highest level, I understand.Van Zieks: I have heard that international transmissions along supposedly secure lines are somehow being intercepted... ...and leaked to various other countries.Ryunosuke: And presumably...those transmissions are in the form of wired telegrams?Van Zieks: Of course.Ryunosuke: Juror number five! Your input, please!Juror No. 5: ......... Stop. Oh! M-Me, sir? Whatever is the matter?Ryunosuke: You told the court before that you worked at the same communication station as Mr Graydon, did you not?Juror No. 5: Y-Yes, that's correct.Ryunosuke: And the particular station where you work... ...deals with government communications and newspaper reports?Juror No. 5: Oh, yes! We're not your run-of-the-mill communication station at all. Our work is extremely important.Ryunosuke: Then tell me...is this not a very familiar sound?Juror No. 5: Hm...? ......... You, you don't mean to say...? Is it...?Ryunosuke: That's right, madam. It bears more than a passing resemblance to the sound made by your telegraph machine as you tap it. I believe it's called...Morse code?Juror No. 5: But... I don't believe it!Ryunosuke: Now correct me if I'm wrong...but when it comes to leaking telegrams from government departments... ...there could be nobody more perfectly placed than a highly skilled communications officer!Van Zieks: Are, are you suggesting that the music box disk... ...contains stolen government secrets in Morse code?!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar! Please, everyone! Ordaaar!!! But this... This is... This is high treason, Counsel! Deserving of capital punishment!Juror No. 6: Too much new wocabulary! What is this 'treason'? And what is 'capital punishment'?Ryunosuke: (The sorts of words I'd half expect you to know...)Judge: For our sovereign government's confidential information, hostile nations would surely pay almost any price!Ryunosuke: Yes...and on that night two months ago... ...that was the very negotiation that was taking place inside the omnibus!Van Zieks: But in the end, McGilded perished, and the all-important disk lay unclaimed in the pawnbrokery...Judge: My word!Ryunosuke: In which case... ...whoever stole that information in the first place must surely have been beside himself with worry. Because if the disk were to be discovered before it found its way out of the country...Judge: ...It would reveal an act of high treason punishable by death!Ryunosuke: So the culprit had no choice but to retrieve it. And in order to do that... ...he would have to gain entry to the pawnbrokery illegally in the middle of the night. Because the article left behind by Mr McGilded would incriminate him too much if it got into the wrong hands. Isn't that right...Mr Graydon?!Graydon: ......... You, you think I've been stealing government secrets? Preposterous! Absolutely preposterous!Judge: So, in response to the defence's accusation... ...you claim complete innocence, do you?Graydon: Well of course I do! I've had to stand here in silence while that pretentious foreign lawyer has been prattling away!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Then by all means...counter the charges, sir!Graydon: ...!Van Zieks: The prosecution demands the witness testifies...in response to the accusations brought by the defence!Graydon: ......... ...Delighted, I'm sure.Judge: The witness is reminded that the crime under scrutiny in this trial is the murder of the pawnbroker, Mr Windibank. That being a most flagitious offence, for which the law of this land sanctions a capital punishment. But the heinous act of high treason is no less serious a crime. ...I urge you to bear that in mind as you testify, Mr Graydon.Graydon: .........Judge: So then, let us proceed. You may-???:Nash: Ya gotta let us 'ave a rabbit an' pork 'ere, guvnor! We got things to say!Judge: I, I beg your pardon? Who do you think you are?Nash: Name's Nash Skulkin!

Very bad timin'.Witness Testimony - Graydon's Counter -Graydon: A mere communications officer couldn't possibly steal confidential government information! Besides, the sounds produced by that music box aren't even Morse code! It was some low-class brickmaker negotiating with McGilded anyway, was it not? I've no relation to the man!Nash: Look, all we dun is break into the gaff the other night like wot 'e told us to do!Ringo: If we'd known there woz dodgy gov'ment secrets involved, we wouldn't 'ave touched it!Ryunosuke: .........Van Zieks: .........Judge: ......... Erm...Mr and Mr Skulkin...Nash: One mister'll do, guvnor. ...Wot's up?Judge: Do I take it that you now admit to the crime? That on the night in question, you did indeed gain entry to the premises illegally? And moreover...you did so as a party of three, in collaboration with Mr Graydon here?Nash: .........WE DID, GUV, WE DID!!!Judge: Quieten down, please. ...What say you to that, Mr Graydon?Graydon: ...I have no idea what these two ruffians are referring to.Nash: You little rotter, gettin' us mixed up in all this monkey business! You never said nuffin' about no gov'ment secrets! It woz s'posed to be a straight-up job!Ringo: An' wot about the geezer whose shop it woz, eh? Poor old bloke didn't 'ave to die, did 'e?!Graydon: Agh...!Ryunosuke: (Nice to know who your friends are...)Graydon: Whatever these men say, I deny the accusations.Judge: Indeed... Well, I certainly wasn't expecting this little music box to become so significant in the proceedings. However, as it has, I will admit it into the Court Record as evidence.The small music box has been entered into the Court Record.Examine evidence Small Music Box Mechanism in top compartment Ryunosuke: This is the mechanism that turns the bumps on the disk into sound...isn't it? Iris: Yes, the 'movement'. It's all thanks to the comb with its teeth that are plucked by the passing bumps. Usually, the teeth on the comb are different lengths so that each one produces a different tone. But this comb is very strange. All the teeth are exactly the same length. Ryunosuke: Well...what does that mean? Iris: It means that no matter which tooth is plucked by the passing bumps, the music box will make the same sound. I've never seen a music box like it before. Ryunosuke: Yes, it is strange. A music box that can only play a single note... (There has to be some significance to that, surely.) Music box disk Ryunosuke: See how the 'For McGilded' disk sits in the music box the man deposited at Windibank's. It couldn't be a more perfect fit. Iris: So there's no question then! The disk was designed to be played in this music box. Ryunosuke: Yet despite that, the sounds it produces are neither musical, nor do they appear to have any meaning. (It just doesn't make any sense...) Iris: I wonder... ...if perhaps there's more to this music box than meets the eye. Maybe we haven't discovered all its secrets yet. Knob on bottom Ryunosuke: ...Oh! Iris: What is it, Runo? Ryunosuke: I've, I've just noticed something about this music box... It looks like the bottom of it opens up as well. Iris: Ah! You're right! Well come on then! What are you waiting for? Let's open it! Ryunosuke: Alright then...here goes... Iris: Look at that! There's another movement on the underside! Ryunosuke: So...does that mean... ...you can set another disk to play back on this side? Iris: Yes, I think so. And it looks like the two movements are linked together. Ryunosuke: They're linked? Iris: So if you had two disks, they would both play back at the same time. Bottom compartment (after examining knob on bottom) Ryunosuke: Who'd have thought there would be a second movement on the underside of the box? Iris: And this movement is like the other one. The comb's teeth are all the same length. Ryunosuke: So...this movement also only produces a single tone, like the other one? Iris: Yes, it must do. Except that the length of the teeth on the two combs isn't the same. So the single tone produced by this movement will be different to the single tone we've already heard. Ryunosuke: What? Iris: Basically, each movement can only produce a single note... Ryunosuke: ...but the notes they produce are different. (A music box that can only play two tones...)Cross-Examination - Graydon's Counter -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

Sholmes' cry pierced through the thick wall of fog around us. Wisps of vapour flowed over the pistol as I cocked it, and I waited breathlessly in the stillness. The silence lasted for what seemed an eternity until, at last, it appeared. From the shadows of the cloud, an enormous beast sprang out upon us. A hound it was, but not such a hound as any mortal has ever seen. Its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, the whole of its ox-sized body was outlined in white-hot flames. Its rumbling pant and hideous howl... So terrified was I that I began to tremble with fear. 'Look well, Wilson!' Sholmes declared, gazing upon the mystical beast. 'For this! This is the diabolical Hound of the Baskervilles!' Our first two months in London passed by in a flash. In that disconcerting courtroom experience we were first thrown into on the day we arrived in the country... ...and in Soseki-san's terrible ordeal that had followed closely behind, we had emerged victorious. However... ...there then came an abrupt end to our opportunities to appear in court. Which was hardly surprising, of course... ...since I was nothing more than an amateur, an unknown student of law from a faraway land. So life in our little office was very quiet. That is... ...until it was shattered one day, by that fateful telegram... 15th April, 9:13 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy *Knock knock knock* That morning... ...I was woken by the unreserved knocking on the door by the telegram boy. But after he'd gone... ...Susato-san's behaviour became very obviously strange. Ryunosuke: Um...Susato-san? Susato: Yes! Is it time to leave for court already? Let me see... What case is it today? Ryunosuke: I...don't think I'm scheduled to defend anyone at the moment, am I? Susato: Oh! No, of course not. How silly of me. Ryunosuke: But I think Iris said she would make us breakfast this morning. So shall we go down to Mr Sholmes's suite? Susato: Yes! Iris makes the most delicious breakfast food. Ryunosuke: She does, doesn't she? Susato: And once our bellies are full, we can leave for court in fighting fit form! Let me see... What case is it today? Ryunosuke: (Here we go again...) 15th April Sholmes's Suite Iris: Morning, Runo! Morning, Susie! Susato: Good morning, Iris! Ryunosuke: Um...Iris... Iris: What is it, Runo? Ryunosuke: What is that terrible noise? It sounds like a cat being strangled. Iris: Ah, yes... You noticed that, did you? Hurley isn't in the best form this morning, it seems. Sholmes: Hello... Susato: Hello...Mr Sholmes. Ryunosuke: G-Good morning. Sholmes: ......... A good morning to die perhaps... Ryunosuke: ...Has something happened, Mr Sholmes?

I hope you've been well. Gina: Eh?! Wot, you remember me then, do ya? Ryunosuke: Well, I remember being completely surrounded by smoke, that's for sure. Gina: So...wot are you doin' in 'ere? Down and out, like the rest of us? Nuffin' to eat? Come to pop that black weasel - sorry, 'coat' - 'ave ya? Ryunosuke: (...What is it about this black uniform that makes everyone comment on it?) Sholmes: Ah, good day. Unless I'm much mistaken... ...you would be the young pickpocket who stole our experimental smoke grenade launcher. Gina: Agh! Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: So...you have something of value to pawn, do you? Allow me to see the article, and I shall negotiate with Mr Windibank on your behalf. Gina: Pull the other one! I don't need no 'elp from some stuck-up dee! Get outta my business! Go on, or I'll make trouble for ya! Sholmes: As you wish, Miss Lestrade. I will happily remove myself from your presence. Ryunosuke: (He's really done it. He's gone.) Windibank: I'm sorry, but as I said, there really is no room for negotiation here. Ryunosuke: (What is that thing he has in his hand? Some kind of metal disk?) Gina: And you! Go on! Leave me alone! Susato: Oh, Miss Lestrade, just pretend we aren't here. We shan't be offended in the slightest. Gina: ......... Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: (Susato-san can really stand her ground when she wants to.) Gina: Wotever... After clearing \"Gina Lestrade\" and \"New article to pawn\" Converse options with Pop Windibank: ???: Out of my way, please! Ryunosuke: (Who's this picture-postcard English gentleman?) ???: Good day to you, ladies. Gentlemen. Gina: Wot's your problem, eh? ???: There is no problem, as long as you remove yourself. I've a matter to discuss with the proprietor. Gina: ...! ???: And if you intend to make a problem of it, I shall see you outside, little girl, for the hiding you deserve. Gina: Look, ain't it obvious? I ain't done talkin' wiv 'im yet. If you think yer such a gent, you should know 'ow to wait in line. ???: ......... Well, you are an impudent little brat, aren't you? ...As well as a pickpocket. Gina: Eh? Who, who are you? 'Ow d'you know who I am? ???: The question is, how do YOU not know who I am? You haven't the courtesy even to remember the faces of your victims, it seems. Gina: ...! Wot?! You mean I...? From you...? ???: Broker! Windibank: Um, yes, sir? ???: I believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemd an article from you, no? Windibank: Yes, yes, erm... ???: The article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once. Susato: Oh my! Gina: Now that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull? ???: Give me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box disks, too. Gina: No! You, you can't 'ave it! You just can't! It's me old man's! Or it was! ...Now it's mine! Susato: Goodness, Mr Naruhodo... ...this is a very awkward situation. Ryunosuke: Yes... I think perhaps we should hear both sides of the story in a little more detail. After clearing all Converse options with Gina Lestrade and \"Eggert Benedict\": Windibank: So, let that be an end to the matter. And thank you for your custom, Mr Eggert Benedict, sir. Benedict: With such reasonable rates of interest...I may even decide to come back. Gina: ......... Tsk! This is why I 'ate grown-ups! Just cos I'm a diver, everyone thinks that makes me a liar. Benedict: And the contents of the coat pockets, if you please, broker. Windibank: But of course, sir. Here is the disk for you. Benedict: ......... Just this one? Windibank: Pardon, sir? Benedict: I was expecting another. Er, that is...I deposited another. Ryunosuke: (Another disk?) Windibank: Oh, um... Oh dear. I regret to inform you, sir, that what was deposited with me was merely the overcoat. The disk happened to be in one of the pockets, but I was completely unaware of it until now. Benedict: So, gutterling... You're hiding more of what's rightfully mine, are you? Gina: Says who, eh? I don't know nuffin' about it! Benedict: ......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style. Gina: Wait a minute! That disk... ...is mine! Benedict: Argh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal! Susato: Oh my! Yes! There's blood on the disk! Ryunosuke: (It's because of all those sharp little bumps! The man must have scratched his finger on them.) Gina: I found it first, alright! I mean! It belonged to me old man! So yer not 'avin' it! ...Oi, you! You take it! Ryunosuke: Me? Gina: If I 'ang onto it, they'll 'ave it off me again. So you keep 'old of it. Ryunosuke: Miss Lestrade, I... (Why is this disk so important to her?) The music box disc has been entered into the Court Record. Benedict: You there! In the black livery! Hand that disk to me at once, please. Gina: No! Don't! He's lyin'! Grown-ups are all liars! Ryunosuke: (Ugh... What do I do now? How am I going to resolve this?) Ryunosuke: Erm...Mr Sholmes... ...what are you examining with such keen interest there? As you enjoy a bar of caramel, I see. Sholmes: ......... So... ...you've found me at last...Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: After that young pickpocket sent me on my way, I was forced to lurk in the shadows. Cruelly ostracised, as the rest of you partook in the jovial atmosphere of fellowship. I had nothing to occupy my mind, but was too ashamed to let society see what my downfall had done to me. So feigning mock interest, I pretended to examine the tedious trinkets in this desolate place. ...Whilst, as you shrewdly observed, gnawing on the only friend I have left: this seven per cent solution of caramel. Pray, do you claim to understand the depths of my despair, Mr Naruhodo? But how could you?! I was so lonely... So desperately lonely... Ryunosuke: Then...why on earth didn't you rejoin the conversation? Things have gone from bad to worse here, you know! Sholmes: Yes...I overheard much of your conversation. Or rather...in my craving for human contact, my ears devoured every word that was uttered! Ryunosuke: ...You really were sad, weren't you? Susato: Poor Mr Sholmes. I feel simply awful for you. Sholmes: It would seem... ...that my inferences are correct. Susato: Oh! ...Surely you're not about to tell us... ...that you've solved the entire case once again?! Sholmes: My dear madam, sometimes I wonder... Were my genius for deduction to be commoditised... ...how much could I pawn it for? Ryunosuke: (It seems Mr Sholmes has had another of his flashes of inspiration. But who knows if it will help to resolve the situation between Miss Lestrade and the mysterious gentleman? What's the right thing to do here...?) Sholmes: Well, Miss Lestrade...it would appear you find yourself in something of a predicament. Gina: Tsk! Where the blue blazes 'ave you been, eh? Sholmes: Pardon? Gina: When a lady's in trouble, a true gent's s'posed to be there to 'elp. Straight away! Not an 'our later! Ryunosuke: (...Harsh.) Benedict: And who, pray tell, are you? Sholmes: ......... Mr Eggert Benedict... ...you have, in my eyes, a veritably encyclopaedic array of curiosities about your person. Nevertheless, there are two immovable conclusions I have drawn. Benedict: I beg your pardon? Sholmes: The first is this: The true reason for your visit to this pawnbrokery today is something you have not yet revealed. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: And the second is this: A considerable crime is in contemplation. One you will orchestrate, with intent to steal a vast sum of money. Well, Mr Benedict? What say you to my deductions? Benedict: How...! Ryunosuke: (He's turned as white as a hard-boiled egg!) Susato: It would seem that once again...Mr Sholmes has made a flawless deduction! Benedict: Just who do you think you are, sir? Sholmes: Ah yes, as I hoped... That is precisely the pained expression I was looking for. So...shall we begin? The time has come for yet another Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! The Great DeductionThe game is afoot! Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Sholmes: First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! The piece of paper in your hand is a 'staff wanted' advertisement from this very shop. Yet even the most unobservant would soon realise that a man of your appearance has no need of such employ. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction. Benedict: What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years! Sholmes: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. The end of any walking cane would be terminated with a metal ferrule to protect the wooden tip. And yet detailed analysis shows the wooden tip of this stick to be utterly bare. Therefore...there is only one conclusion: The rod that you hold in your hand, which appears to be a walking cane... ...is in fact no cane at all! Benedict: ...! Sholmes: You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong? Benedict: I... Well, I... Sholmes: And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear? Benedict: ......... Sholmes: Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. From the moment I saw it, my suspicions were aroused. 'What walking cane demands such a stout handle?' mused I. Benedict: ......... Sholmes: But of course, as I said, this is no walking cane. No, that rod... ...is the broken handle of a shovel! Benedict: Wha...? Are you insane?! Sholmes: And now, having determined this undeniable truth, the conclusion is clear. Your true motive for coming here... ...was to take employment at this establishment in order to excavate the ground beneath the premises! What a calculated crime you have conceived, sir. A wickedly calculated crime. Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery Topic 2 Great Crime Sholmes: Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning. Benedict: This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, intend to excavate the ground beneath this pawnbrokery with a broken shovel? What on earth do you propose I could expect to find there? Some long-forgotten treasure, I suppose? Save for such a fanciful theory, what possible reason could I have to do as you say? Sholmes: Oh, but there is ample reason... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped. Benedict: What? Sholmes: Let us consider what would motivate a man to infiltrate a shop such as this and covertly dig beneath its floor... The answer is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. This letter gives notice of public works to be carried out in the local area. And according to the enclosed plan of the upcoming sewerage works... ...beneath this shop runs a sewer that adjoins another, one that runs under the bank on the opposite side of the road. Benedict: This madness has entered the sewers now, has it?! Sholmes: By excavating the ground beneath our feet, you would gain access to the waterway... ...that flows in very close proximity to the great vault of the financial institution opposite. Benedict: What are you...? Sholmes: In summary, sir... ...you devised a master plan to pull off an elaborate bank robbery by dint of the underground tunnels! Benedict: M... Master plan?! Sholmes: Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... With what plunder did the thief hope to make off from the underground vault of the bank? Benedict: Are you quite serious? Sholmes: Having consulted with Scotland Yard some days ago, I happen to know the answer. But naturally, the answer is no secret to you, is it, Mr Benedict? Benedict: I have no idea what you're talking about! Sholmes: Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know. Benedict: A postcard of the Great Exhibition? I'm afraid you've quite lost me. Sholmes: Currently in the final stages of preparation, the Great Exhibition will soon be underway. And the government has provided extra funds to complete its centrepiece, the Crystal Tower. Funds that currently sit in the vault of the bank on the other side of this road! Benedict: Pardon? Sholmes: Yes, the considerable crime you have been contemplating... ...is the theft of that which sits in the vault of that bank, the special reserve funds for the Great Exhibition! ...Of course, that is top-secret police information. So keep it under your hat, please. Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this pawnbroking puzzle! Ryunosuke: Um...Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: Well, Mr Naruhodo? An impressively upbeat deduction for a detective racked with loneliness, would you not agree? Ryunosuke: Was it true what you said about the bank over the road and what it has in its vault? Sholmes: Indeed. Though few know of its existence. It is one of the government's most closely guarded secrets. Gregson told me, in the strictest confidence. Susato: But you just announced it to everyone here. Rather loudly, in fact. Sholmes: ...Ah. Ryunosuke: And if it's such a big secret... ...how would Mr Benedict have come to find out about it? Sholmes: There can be but one explanation for that. Clearly it is because the man is a criminal! Susato: But what if he didn't know anything about the money in the vault? If he is a criminal, as you said... ...then buying a brand new shovel is sure to be the first thing he does now that you've revealed the secret. Sholmes: ...Oh. Ryunosuke: Or if he doesn't... ...maybe Mr Windibank will. He already has plenty of shovels here, after all. Windibank: Oh my life! I assure you I'm not so unscrupulous! Sholmes: Hm, well... Hopefully this has taught you a valuable lesson. Sensitive information must be handled with the utmost of care. One can never be sure that someone privy to secrets won't disclose them. And once the word is out, it's out. Ryunosuke: ...Perhaps I'll think twice before confiding in you next time, Mr Sholmes. Sholmes: An excellent idea, Mr Naruhodo. An excellent idea. Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Susato: Well then, Mr Naruhodo, you know what to do, I'm sure. Ryunosuke: Yes. Let's listen to that great deduction again, and see if we can massage it into shape! Sholmes: Very well, then. Let us start once more from the beginning... ...of Herlock Sholmes's magnificent 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! Course CorrectionHold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery Sholmes: First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! Ryunosuke: So, by Mr Sholmes's reasoning... ...Mr Benedict came here in order to apply for a job so he could dig down through the floor. Susato: Yes. In an attempt to tunnel into the sewers to gain access to the money in the vault of the bank across the road. But...he wouldn't get very far with a broken shovel, would he? Ryunosuke: No. I think it's fair to say his motives lie elsewhere. The question is, where? What did bring Mr Benedict here at this particular point in time? Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! Susato: I still don't quite understand why this gentleman came to Mr Windibank's today. Ryunosuke: He might look like a smartly dressed man about town, but perhaps he's destitute really. I really think that's the only explanation! Susato: We must stop thinking along those lines, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Yes...I suppose you're right. Well in that case... ...perhaps there's something in this pawn shop that the man was looking for? Susato: Let's look closely and see if there's anything about his person that gives us a clue. Ryunosuke: Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the info about Miss Lestrade! Sholmes: Quite so, my dear fellow! It would appear that the writing and sketch on the reverse of the flyer... ...pertain to the pickpocket, Miss Lestrade, and to Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery here. Benedict: Ah! Ryunosuke: You originally told us... ...that you had merely given chase after Miss Lestrade stole the redemption ticket from you. Sholmes: But that, sir, is a thinly veiled lie. Ryunosuke: It is the information on the back of the flyer that led you here today. By which I mean... Here, to Windibank's Pawnbrokery, and today, the redemption deadline of that overcoat. Sholmes: So you waited outside for the young girl matching the description you have written down to arrive. Benedict: Hmph! Sholmes: And you have gone to some lengths to hide the reason for your pursuit of Miss Lestrade. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction. Benedict: What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years! Sholmes: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. Ryunosuke: Um...what's a ferrule? Susato: It's the metal cap commonly found on the end of a cane, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Ah, the bit that makes the nice clacking sound on the pavement? Susato: Yes, exactly, And Mr Sholmes is right, it appears to be missing on this cane. Ryunosuke: ...But it doesn't actually look broken, does it? Susato: No, it doesn't. Though the gentleman certainly did recoil when Mr Sholmes identified the cane as suspicious. Ryunosuke: In other words... ...there's some secret about the cane that Mr Benedict would rather we don't know! The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. Ryunosuke: I don't know, I just can't picture it. I mean, a respectable gentleman strolling the streets of London with a shovel in his hand? (I'm sure it's just that the cane is broken and the ferrule was lost somehow.) Susato: Well, there is one thing of which we can be certain in all of this. After all, we saw it with our own eyes. At the mention of his cane, Mr Benedict visibly recoiled. Ryunosuke: ...! (That's very true. So there's definitely something about this cane that's not right...) Ryunosuke: The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the initialling. Sholmes: A most astute observation...wouldn't you say, Mr Eggert Benedict? Benedict: ...! Sholmes: We are led to believe, sir, that your initials are 'E. B.'. Yet in a most possessive manner, you have in your grasp a cane bearing the initials 'A. G.'. An incontrovertible contradiction indeed, would you not agree? Benedict: No! You're, you're wrong. This cane isn't- Ryunosuke: You said before that you'd had that cane for years. Benedict: Grrr... Ryunosuke: So don't try to tell us that you just borrowed it from a friend or found it in the park! Sholmes: In short... ...though you hold yourself to be a gentleman, you have withheld your true name! Benedict: ...! Sholmes: You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong? Benedict: I... Well, I... Sholmes: And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear? Benedict: ......... Sholmes: Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Ryunosuke: Let's consider the bare bones of what's happened here: Miss Lestrade redeemed that fine-looking overcoat. And now a mysterious man has appeared, introducing himself with a fake name... ...and claiming that the overcoat belongs to him. Susato: But we know that he actually identified Miss Lestrade from a written description. Which suggests that everything else he's told us is untrue. Ryunosuke: So what we need to do here... ...is somehow prove that the overcoat cannot possibly belong to him! The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Ryunosuke: The man is white all over, but for his overcoat. That's almost reason enough to say it doesn't belong to him, isn't it? Susato: But I'm sure the gentleman's wardrobe isn't exclusively white, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Well mine is exclusively black! Susato: ...I think perhaps we should go shopping together. Ryunosuke: (There's no doubt about it. That black overcoat doesn't suit Mr Benedict at all. But we need a more tangible way of proving it...) Ryunosuke: The split seam, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. Benedict: Ah! Sholmes: Yes, because the overcoat is rather obviously a poor fit. Ryunosuke: Having forced it over your broad shoulders, the seam is already breaking apart. Sholmes: My suspicions were aroused from the outset... ...when you so baldly lied about your name and so boldly waylaid this pickpocket. Benedict: Argh! Sholmes: This catalogue of untruths has all been for one very specific purpose: To steal the article that the young girl redeemed from Mr Windibank! Benedict: AAAAAARGH!!! Sholmes: But what really irks me is this: The considerable crime I initially imagined has been considerably curtailed. Topic 1 Mystery Man's Aim Conclusion To tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery To abscond with a redeemed item Solved Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds Sholmes: Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning. Benedict: This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, designed a wheeze to filch some tawdry article of pawnage? Have you forgotten that I redeemed the article in the proper manner, using the watchword? Had I not been the one to deposit it in the first place... ...how could I possibly have known the relevant details? N'est-ce pas? Sholmes: Oh, but the watchword can be discovered... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped. Benedict: What? Sholmes: Let us consider how one might come to learn a secret watchword relating to the pawned property of another... The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Susato: The direction of the deduction must change rather dramatically now, I think. Ryunosuke: Yes, no more talk of tunnelling into the sewers. (Which is a pity, because it all sounded rather exciting.) Anyway... ...you can't deny that this mysterious gentleman did know the watchword. Susato: Yes. 'Professor'... If you didn't know that word, Mr Windibank would never allow you to redeem the article. Ryunosuke: Or, looking at it another way... ...if you did know that word, Mr Windibank would allow you to redeem the article whether it was yours or not. (So the question is, could this gentleman have found the watchword out somehow?) The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Ryunosuke: There's no question that Mr Benedict used some wheeze or other to find out the watchword. (Let's think. He only appeared in the shop after Miss Lestrade had redeemed the overcoat...) Susato: He certainly couldn't have overheard Miss Lestrade saying the watchword. So he can only have discovered it from something on this countertop. Ryunosuke: (It sounds like I need to have another look and examine things more closely this time.) Ryunosuke: The method is revealed by the notelet on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. Sholmes: Yes, the broker here follows the same procedure whenever a customer comes to redeem an article. He asks the customer for the watchword, and notes down the response uttered on a notelet he has to hand. Then he consults his ledger, and confirms whether or not the watchword matches that of the article in question. Benedict: I would expect nothing less of a diligent pawnbroker. Ryunosuke: But his diligence clearly has its disadvantages. Benedict: What are you talking about? Sholmes: It is increasingly apparent that you were present in this shop before your accusation against Miss Lestrade. Ryunosuke: In all likelihood, you followed her inside, and then observed her talking to Mr Windibank. Sholmes: When the diligent broker made a note of the watchword, as is his common practice... Ryunosuke: ...You observed him writing the word 'Professor' on the notelet beside the ledger. Benedict: ...! Sholmes: And that, sir... ...was the master plan you devised to steal the pawned article from the young Miss Lestrade! Benedict: M... Master plan?! Sholmes: Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... Why would you go to such lengths to redeem that particular article from this pawnbroker? Benedict: Are you quite serious? Sholmes: For an ill-fitting overcoat hardly seems to justify the effort, much less a worthless music box disk. But naturally, you had very good reason to make them yours, didn't you, Mr Benedict? Benedict: I have no idea what you're talking about! Sholmes: Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know. Ryunosuke: The articles we're talking about are the overcoat and the music box disk that was in one of the pockets. Susato: Which according to Mr Windibank, isn't even worth a penny. Ryunosuke: And yet this man went to such lengths to steal them... Why? Susato: I wonder if perhaps... ...we already have the evidence we need to explain it, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: (Could we? Really? I'd better have a thorough look through all the evidence we've collected so far.) Ryunosuke: You see, this music box disk tells us all we need to know. Benedict: What's that...on the back...? Sholmes: It reads, 'For McGilded'... Benedict: Agh! Sholmes: Ah, Mr Magnus McGilded... The unfortunate philanthropist who perished in curious circumstances at the Old Bailey two months ago. A prominent man in London...though his loan-mongering demonstrated a distinct lack of scruples. So...you're an associate of his, are you? Or perhaps a subordinate? Benedict: ......... Ryunosuke: Mr McGilded was a man of unusually small stature. In fact... ...he was precisely the right size for that overcoat that you've squeezed yourself into. Benedict: Ugh! Sholmes: Your true identity remains shrouded in mystery... Mr Eggert Benedict. But the final conclusion here is crystal clear. The reason you came to this pawnbrokery today... ...was to retrieve an article left behind by the late Magnus McGilded! Benedict: Tsk... AAAAAAAAARGH!!! Topic 2 Great Crime Conclusion To steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds To acquire an item deposited by Mr McGilded Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Sholmes: Well well, Mr Magnus McGilded... Not a name I expected to hear in these circumstances. Benedict: ......... Susato: Mr Sholmes, I'm afraid there's something very troubling on my mind. Sholmes: Pray tell, Miss Susato. Susato: Well, according to what Mr Windibank told us earlier... ...today was the final day on which the coat could have been redeemed, was it not? Windibank: Yes, ma'am, that is correct. Today would be precisely two months since it was first deposited. Ryunosuke: Well, today is 15th April, so...two months ago today... Windibank: ...Would have been 15th February, sir, that's right. It's all carefully recorded in my ledger. Deposited at 10:30 p.m., I see. Ryunosuke: What?! But, but that suggests... Susato: Yes. 15th February... Ryunosuke: ...Is precisely the day on which the omnibus murder took place! Susato: And half past ten in the evening... ...is precisely the time at which the terrible events were unfolding! Sholmes: Suggestive is not the word. It would seem the matter is entirely beyond coincidence. Benedict: ......... You are of course at liberty to make whatever outlandish deductions you choose. However... ...I must insist you hand over the music box disk now. Ryunosuke: ...! Benedict: It would be a terrible shame to return to your native land in a box. Ryunosuke: Agh... (What do I do?!) Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank! Windibank: This is my shop! I can't allow any harm to come to my customers! If that were to happen... ...I should have to take my own life! Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank, no! ???: Alright, that's enough! Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson! Benedict: Inspector...? Gregson: That's right, sunshine. The alarm was raised on one of our dedicated emergency lines. So we got here as fast as we could. Now, what's this all about, eh? Windibank: Oh, praise be! You're here at last! I was moments away from forfeiting my own life in my very own establishment! Benedict: ......... It would seem you have the upper hand. Gregson: Right, you lot have got some explainin' to do! I don't appreciate bein' bothered with some petty argy-bargy! Susato: Petty?! Mr Windibank very nearly met with his end! Gregson: Yeah, with his own gun, as far as I can tell. Windibank: Oh dear... Gregson: And the whole of Britain could meet with its end if I don't get to the bottom of the case I'm s'posed to be workin' on! Ryunosuke: What?! What on earth is the case, Inspector? Sholmes: Spare no detail, Gregson! Gregson: ...I, I might have said a little too much. No matter. It's nothin' to do with you lot. Anyway, sir, you're gonna have to come with me down to the station. Benedict: ......... But of course, Inspector... Gregson: Aah! He's getting away! Get after him, lads! Whistle the beat officer, too!Sir! Gregson: ...There's been a spate of thefts at pawn shops round here recently. So we've fitted emergency buttons underneath the counters for brokers to let us know when there's trouble. Windibank: Oh, Inspector...I was very worried there for a while. Very worried indeed. Gregson: Now then, Mr Permanently-in-Mournin'... Ryunosuke: Oh! ...Yes? Gregson: I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over! Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, of course... Gina: No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine! Gregson: I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now. Ryunosuke: As evidence...? Sholmes: If the police demand something as evidence, my dear fellow, we have no choice but to capitulate. It's all yours, Inspector. Gina: Grrr... Ryunosuke: And so, we handed Mr McGilded's disk over to Inspector Gregson... ...and were summarily turfed out of the shop and onto the street. To be continued... Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy (before initiating Logic and Reasoning Spectacular) 15th April Baker Street Gina: See? That's why I 'ate grown-ups. All they do is feed you a pack o' lies and take stuff away from ya! Sholmes: Oh really, Miss Lestrade? ...Tell me, is that overcoat keeping you warm? Gina: Wot? Susato: Oh my! Surely, you were given that! Gina: Yeah, the dee let me keep it. After I looked daggers at 'im for long enough. 'E went through the pockets and then said, 'Go on, then, 'ave it' before tellin' me to scarper. Always pays off, givin' people a look like you 'ate 'em. Ryunosuke: I can't help feeling that it's going to get you into serious trouble one day... Gina: Wot I really wanted was that nice, shiny disk, mind. Susato: The music box disk? Ryunosuke: But Mr Windibank said it was practically worthless. Gina: I think I'm gonna go and 'ave another bash. Give 'em a long, 'ard stare. Sholmes: I think not, Miss Lestrade. We shan't enter Windibank's again today. Gina: Why not?! That's not fair! Ryunosuke: It can't be helped, I'm afraid. The police are investigating the scene now, and taking a statement from Mr Windibank. Gina: But that disk's mine! I 'ad the ticket for this coat, and it was in this coat's pocket! And there should be somefin' else an' all! That's wot that rotten cove said, ain't it? Ryunosuke: Yes, he did mention something about another article, didn't he? Gina: Well then, that's mine, too! Wotever it is! Ryunosuke: (Now she's really pushing her luck...) Sholmes: Miss Lestrade, I think it's time to admit defeat. You've had your 'haul' for the day. Gina: Yeah! And it's all your fault, Sholmes! Sholmes: So what are your plans now? Will you dine with us this evening? Gina: Eh? Sholmes: Iris would be delighted to cook, I'm sure. And I might entertain you with a modest violin recital. Gina: ......... No, ta. Sholmes: Oh... Gina: Why would I come round your place, eh? 'Ave you lost your 'ead or somefin'?! Susato: Oh dear. She's gone. Sholmes: Hm, having reviled on me quite unnecessarily, I might add. Ryunosuke: I...can't help wondering... ...if perhaps she might turn up anyway. Sholmes: Interesting... Ryunosuke: Once she's had a chance to calm down, I think there's a good chance she'll decide to come. Sholmes: ......... Very well, then. I'll inform Iris to set a place for our potential guest at the dinner table this evening. And one more thing... I should be glad of your company later, too. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: I believe I will have a rather splendid surprise to show you. Susato: Oh, how exciting! What is it? Sholmes: You shall have to wait and see, Miss Susato. ...Until later, then! 15th April, 3:46 p.m. Sholmes's Suite Iris: Ah, Susie! And Runo! Come in, come in! Ryunosuke: Good afternoon, Iris. Susato: Thank you so much for breakfast this morning. Iris: Oh, don't mention it! ...Goodness! Look at the time already! Ryunosuke: Busy as always? Iris: I am! I'm preparing everything for dinner this evening. Ryunosuke: Already? You're obviously cooking something special, are you? Iris: Oh, yes! After all, we have a special guest joining us! Guess who it is! Go on! Hee hee, you'll never guess! Ryunosuke: Um... (Look at those little eyes of hers shining!) Susato: Oh dear. It is awkward when you already know the answer, isn't it? Iris: It's Ginny! Isn't that exciting?! Susato: Oh! Oh...what a surprise! Yes, that's wonderful news! Ryunosuke: (Wow, Iris seems overjoyed at the idea!) Iris: I can't wait to learn some pickpocketing tips from a real professional! Ryunosuke: Oh yes! That does sound like fun! Susato: I'm not sure that's entirely appropriate. Are you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Erm... By the way, Iris, what's Mr Sholmes up to? Iris: Hurley? Oh, he's been like that ever since he got back. Ryunosuke: ...Hellooo! Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: I beg that you won't speak to me. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: I don't know who you are, but kindly take your leave. As you can see, I'm not here. Ryunosuke: ......... (I, I don't know how to respond to that.) Iris: I do apologise. When he gets like this, he's completely oblivious to everything. Ryunosuke: Yes... I see... Iris: Really, he behaves just like a child sometimes, Hurley does. Susato: Mr Sholmes and Iris have something of a parent-and-child relationship, don't they? Ryunosuke: Yes, except that Iris is clearly the parent here... (Come to think of it... ...I wonder where her real parents are.) Iris: What's the matter, Runo? You have ever such a funny look on your face! Ryunosuke: Oh...no...it's nothing. Iris: I know what it is! 'Why does this girl live here with Mr Sholmes?' you're wondering. ...Am I right? Ryunosuke: How?! How did you...? Iris: Heh heh, oh, Runo! I can read you like a book! Ryunosuke: (Ugh... This girl is dangerous...) Iris: Don't worry, you can ask me anything! I won't mind. After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Ah, my dear fellows! How good to see you! Susato: Eek! Mr, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Whyever did you not make your presence known to me before? Ryunosuke: ...Haah. Sholmes: Well, no matter now. So, how the devil are you? Ryunosuke: We've...been with you for most of the day. Sholmes: Goodness, really? Susato: Do tell me, Mr Sholmes, is your violin unscathed? Sholmes: Hm? My violin? Whatever are you talking about, dear madam? Susato: Oh! Um... Sholmes: Never mind that now. I have something far more interesting to show you. Behold, my dear fellows! Susato: Oh, another music box disk. Sholmes: No, not 'another' disk, Miss Susato. This is the one Gregson demanded we hand over as evidence: Mr McGilded's disk! Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: Then, then...what's it doing here?! Sholmes: Heh heh heh! You know, at times, Mr Naruhodo... ...I think that though I have an undeniable turn for detection... ...I may well be even more adept at larceny! Iris: Ooh! That would be wonderfully exciting! I'd be your pickpocketing assistant! And Runo could be our go-to lawyer if we ever got caught! Ryunosuke: Right... Iris: Plus, Susie has such beautiful handwriting, she could write all our menacing crime notifications! Susato: Yes! I'd be delighted! Ryunosuke: (I'm just going to pretend this conversation never happened, I think.) After clearing all Converse options: Iris: Well, it's time I started getting things ready for dinner, I think. Ginny will be here before long. Sholmes: Thank you, Iris. Susato: Oh, well you must let me help you, then. Iris: Of course, Susie! There's plenty to do. Sholmes: I think I shall investigate the condition of my faithful performing partner. Now then...where did I leave it...? Ryunosuke: Let this be a lesson to you, Mr Sholmes: Never leave anything too precious with the pawnbroker. Sholmes: Hm, yes... You may be right. Susato: Oh, that reminds me! Of something Mr Windibank said before. He said that he had a manuscript of Iris's in pawn, didn't he? Sholmes: Did he? Ryunosuke: Yes, he definitely mentioned it. 'Mr Sholmes's latest tale of otherworldly mystery lies dormant in my storeroom,' were his words, I believe. Iris: So you heard about that, did you? I expect you were as incensed as I was! Susato: Oh yes! The idea of such a wonderful story languishing in Mr Windibank's storeroom, gathering dust... Sholmes: My dear madam, I'm quite sure I told you already... ...the pawnbroker's storeroom is the safest place for it. More secure than a bank's vault! Iris: And what about your Stradivarius, Hurley? Was that safe and secure? Sholmes: Weeell... There may be the occasional mix-up. Ryunosuke: (Caused by a certain impetuous someone not too far from me now...) Iris: Do you have any idea how long it took me to write that Baskerville story, Hurley? Susato: Oh, it sounds so exciting! 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'! I should love to read it! Iris: ......... Sholmes: ......... Susato: .........Ah! Ryunosuke: ......... (What's going on here? Why does it feel like an icy chill just swept through the room?) Iris: Susie...what did you just say? Susato: Erm... Iris: You said...'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... But...how could you know the full title? Susato: Well, that's... ......... Ryunosuke: That's because Miss Susato is such a great fan of all the stories about Mr Sholmes, of course. Iris: But Runo, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... ...has never been published. Ryunosuke: What? Iris: When I showed Hurley the manuscript, he told me that I wasn't allowed to publish it yet. Ryunosuke: I don't understand... Iris: That's why he said that he'd keep it safe. Until it was the right time for the story to be made public, you see. Ryunosuke: So that's why the manuscript is at Windibank's...? Iris: And yet, how could Susie here know its title? Well Hurley? What's going on? Sholmes: ......... ...Ah! Ryunosuke: ...? What is it, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: It would appear our guest has arrived. Ryunosuke: Miss Lestrade! Gina: ......... ...This was a bad idea. I knew I weren't welcome. I'm goin'! Ryunosuke: No! Wait! ...Miss Lestrade! We've all been eagerly awaiting your arrival. ...Haven't we, Iris? Iris: ......... Oh yes! Just wait there, Ginny. We'll have everything ready in a jiffy! Come along, Susie! Susato: Right! Of course! It's a pleasure to see you here, Miss Lestrade. Please, make yourself at home! Sholmes: Don't stand in the doorway, my dear girl. Come along in! What say you to some Mendelssohn? I won't take 'no' for an answer! Ryunosuke: ...Meddlesome it is, then. Gina: ......... Wagahai: ...Miaow. Ryunosuke: That evening... ...Iris prepared us all a meal that was even more delicious than usual... ...Mr Sholmes's violin performance was in no way meddlesome... ...and Gina, as we came to call her, taught us all how to steal things from one another without being noticed. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves...well into the night. 15th April, 9:34 p.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Ryunosuke: That was a very enjoyable evening, wasn't it? Susato: Oh yes! Iris's cooking was truly divine! Ryunosuke: And I feel as though I can still hear the enchanting strains of Mr Sholmes's violin even now. Susato: Best of all...I bet I could steal the glasses from His Lordship's face next time we're in court! ......... Naruhodo-san...could I consult with you about something, I wonder? Ryunosuke: What's the matter, Susato-san? Susato: ......... It's...about the telegram I received. Ryunosuke: Ah... (The one that arrived first thing this morning, I suppose.) Susato: ......... I've...I've been summoned. Ryunosuke: What?! Summoned? ...What do you mean? Susato: The telegram was from the Lord Chief Justice's office. Lord Stronghart has asked to see me. Ryunosuke: The Lord Chief Justice? ...When? Susato: Tomorrow morning. Ryunosuke: What?! Then, then we have to start preparing at once! Susato: Oh! No...that won't be necessary, Naruhodo-san. I've been summoned alone. Ryunosuke: Alone? What on earth for? Susato: ......... I have no idea. I suppose I shall find out tomorrow. Ryunosuke: (What's all this about? Whatever it is, it's making me feel very uneasy...) *Knock knock* Ryunosuke: (Oh, who could that be, I wonder?) Iris: Good evening, friends! Ryunosuke: Ah, Iris. Hello again. Gina: ......... Susato: And Gina, too. Iris: Yes! Ginny's going to stay with us tonight. She's going to sleep in with me! ...Isn't that right, Ginny? Gina: Well...yeah... Susato: How lovely! Let me make a pot of tea. Iris: You know, I've learnt so much today! Susato: Oh, what...in particular? Iris: All those things Ginny showed us! Wasn't it wonderful? Ryunosuke: Ah, you mean all those pickpocketing techniques? We had fun trying them out on each other, didn't we? Iris: I think I've awakened a natural talent! I could earn a living from it! Ryunosuke: (...You might be getting ahead of yourself a little there.) So...what brings you up to our humble quarters at this late hour? Iris: Well, you see... ...I came to return this. Ryunosuke: Wait, what?! That's, that's mine! Susato: Oh my! However did you...? Iris: I told you, didn't I? I have a natural talent for it! Ryunosuke: (Oh yes, I'd forgotten... ...Iris literally is a child genius.) Iris: So anyway, here...you can have it back. Not that I really understand why you wear it, though. Ryunosuke: Ah. Thank you. Iris: Alright then, good night! Ryunosuke: Yes, good night. Iris: ......... Hm... So this is your office, is it? What do you think, Ginny? Gina: I think I wouldn't fancy me chances wiv a lawyer wot lives in a place like this. Iris: Yes! Me too! Hahahaha! Ryunosuke: (It seems as though Iris here... ...still has something she'd like to talk about.) Susato: I suppose...she probably wants to talk about the manuscript. Ryunosuke: (Yes, I suppose she probably does.) After clearing all Converse options with Iris Wilson and Gina Lestrade: Iris: Oh my goodness! Look at the time! Come along, Ginny, we should go back downstairs. Gina: Yeah...alright. Iris: And please, don't mention any of this to Hurley, will you? Ryunosuke: No...of course not. Good night then, Iris. Good night, Gina. Susato: You must let me make breakfast for you tomorrow morning! I insist! Iris: Oh, yes please! I can't wait, Susie! Good night, then! Ryunosuke: (Iris... It sure is easy to forget, isn't it? Sometimes she speaks just like an adult. But deep down, she's still just a child.) Susato: Well, I think it's time that I turned in for the night, too, Naruhodo-san. Ryunosuke: Dr John H. Wilson... Iris's father... But also... ...the name of the murdered visiting professor at Yumei University. It can't be a mere coincidence... There's something deeper going on... ........................... .................. ......... ???: ...ster Naruhodo... ...Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: (That voice... That's...Mr Sholmes!) What's going on? It's the middle of the night. Sholmes: It's Miss Lestrade... She's gone. Ryunosuke: Gina? Sholmes: She was supposed to be sleeping in Iris's room. But her bed is empty. Ryunosuke: Well...she's an independent young woman. She probably decided to go home, no? Sholmes: I think not. From speaking to her before she retired... ...I received the distinct impression that she was looking forward to breakfasting with Miss Susato. No, I don't believe the girl has gone home. But I've been waiting for over an hour now. Ryunosuke: Over an hour? Oh... Sholmes: If you'll indulge me, look out of the window, my dear fellow. Ryunosuke: (What's this about?) ...! Wait a minute... (Why is there a light on at this time of night?) Sholmes: That's Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery. Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank's... (Oh no!) Gina: It's simple! If that story was really in old Windibank's storeroom... ...there's no way someone from 'alf way around the world - in other words, you - could know about it. Gina: Sorry, Iris, but if you ask me, 'e's sold it. Wivout tellin' you. Ryunosuke: (Could Gina have gone...?) Sholmes: It seems you have some knowledge of the situation, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? ...Oh, no! No, not really. Sholmes: Well anyway, we must investigate. ???: At once! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! 16th April, 1:14 a.m. Baker Street Ryunosuke: The door to Windibank's... It's open! Susato: And the lamp is burning. Ryunosuke: It must be Gina...mustn't it? Sholmes: Let us hope it's nothing more sinister. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: Come, there's not a moment to lose! Clearly something is afoot inside! Ryunosuke: ...There's no one here... Sholmes: ...Oh yes... ...there is! *BANG!* Susato: AAAAAAAH!!! Mr Sholmes! Mr Shooolmes!!! Ryunosuke: What the- (Has Sholmes been shot?!) Sholmes: Leave me, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: But... Sholmes: After them! Go! Ryunosuke: Right! Ryunosuke: ...Blast! (I've lost them!) ???: 'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere? Bobby: The alarm was just raised from this pawnbroker's sir. Would you know somethin' about that? Ryunosuke: Officer! Come with me! It's my friend! Mr Sholmes! He's been shot! Bobby: Shot?! Ryunosuke: With the policeman close behind me, I ran back to Windibank's... Anime cutscene Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! Susato: Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: How bad is it? Sholmes: Agh...never mind me. But there's much at stake. Behind that door... In the storeroom! ...Hurry! Ryunosuke: Huh?! It's...it's Gina?! To be continued... *BANG!* AAAAAAAH!!! I'll be alright, Mr Naruhodo! After them! Go! Behind that door. In the storeroom! ...Hurry! It's...it's Gina?! From that moment, Windibank's Pawnbrokery became a crime scene. Everything that followed happened in a whirlwind of activity. The arrival of the police, the preliminary investigation of the scene and the questioning... It was just before dawn before I was allowed back to my lodgings at 221B. 16th April, 6:21 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Ryunosuke: Oh! Iris! Iris: A telegram came. But all it said was, 'Wait at home'. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, we asked one of the policemen to have it sent. It was simply impossible to come back. Iris: When I woke up...I was all alone. Hurley and Ginny were gone. Everyone was gone. What happened, Runo? Ryunosuke: (Poor Iris. She's trembling. She's obviously trying very hard not to let herself get too worried.) ...I'll explain everything that I know. Iris: Something awful has happened, hasn't it? Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, I'm afraid so. After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: I'm afraid I'll need to go out again now, Iris. There's not much I can do at the moment... But I can at least try to find out how Mr Sholmes and Gina are getting on. Iris: I want to go, too. Take me with you, Runo! Ryunosuke: ...! Iris: I can't stand just sitting around here waiting. Ryunosuke: (I'm not sure how I feel about taking a ten-year-old child to the scene of a murder... But I don't want to leave her all alone here, either.) Alright then, Iris. Perhaps you can help me? Iris: Oh yes! I'd love to! Ryunosuke: Gina's at the prison. Mr Sholmes is...probably in his hospital bed. Iris: And don't forget we have to visit the crime scene! We need to conduct a thorough investigation! Ryunosuke: Ah, I can see you're ready for action! (I imagine Iris would appreciate going to the hospital sooner rather than later...) Sholmes's Suite Baker Street 16th April St Synner's Hospital, Ward 3 Iris: Hurley! ...Oh! He's not here! Ryunosuke: No. That's strange... The nurse definitely said he was in the bed by the window, didn't she? Iris: Ooh, I know what's probably happened! Hurley was being a big baby. And the bullet wound wasn't that bad after all so he's been sent home. Ryunosuke: Hm, I'm not so sure about that. Baby or not... ...there's no question that it was a fairly serious injury that Mr Sholmes suffered. Iris: Oh... ???: 'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere? Bobby: This ward is off limits! No visitin'! So what are you doin' in 'ere, eh? Iris: Well, I'll have you know, we're Hurley's next of kin! Bobby: Eh? ...Oh! Well beggin' your pardon then, ma'am. Sir. ...A little lady and a curious Eastern gentleman... The great mystery-solver 'as a mysterious family, eh. Ryunosuke: (...If that's how you see us, um...sure.) Iris: Where is he, Constable? Where's Hurley? Bobby: I believe 'e is currently in the operatin' theatre, ma'am. Undergoin' an extensive operation. Iris: Extensive?! Bobby: It 'as been several 'ours since 'e went in. Iris: Oh dear... Is he going to be alright? Bobby: Well, it doesn't appear to be workin', you see. The anaesthetic, that is. Iris: Oh! Bobby: I 'ave 'eard a report that the gentleman claims 'e may 'ave 'ad a little too much to drink last night. Coffee, that is. Ryunosuke: Haah... Bobby: Anyway, I think it would be fair to assume that 'e won't be back 'ere for several 'ours yet. Ryunosuke: ...I see. Thank you, Constable. Perhaps we should leave and come back later. Iris: Oh, poor Hurley... 16th April Windibank's Pawnbrokery Iris: This is where it happened, then? Last night. Ryunosuke: That's right. The two thugs I told you about were obviously ransacking the place, looking for valuables. Iris: But... ...apart from the policemen in here, you wouldn't know anything had happened. There's no sign of a disturbance. Ryunosuke: No...you're right about that, actually. Iris: In fact, if anyone, it's the police who seem to be the ones doing the ransacking. Ryunosuke: I know what you mean. They're like a gang of organised criminals, all dressed in black! ???: Oi! I heard that! Ryunosuke: Oh, Inspector! Erm... Good morning. Gregson: Hmph. I s'pose I ought to thank you for your vigilance last night. We got to the scene before it was disturbed at least. Shame you let the two rogues get away, mind. Ryunosuke: Yes... I'm sorry about that. Iris: ...I thought you'd assigned extra men to the beat around here, Gregsy. Now look what's happened! Hurley's been injured because there weren't enough police on duty! Gregson: .........Ah! Y...Y...Your Ladyship! No one told me you were comin'! Iris: I expect you to take full responsibility for what happened to Hurley and see he has the very best medical care! Gregson: Of course, Your Ladyship! The very best doctors in the capital are tendin' to him as we speak! Iris: And I don't think it's Runo's fault that the rogues managed to get away, is it? Chasing criminals is the police's job. Gregson: Absolutely, Your Ladyship! As you say, ma'am, as you say! The gent in black is totally blameless! Everyone's in agreement about that. Ryunosuke: (Would you believe it?! He's like a completely different person with Iris. Talk about a personality change...) Gregson: Oh! Where are me manners? Are you thirsty, Your Ladyship? Perhaps you'd like some juice? Some nice, refreshin' fruit juice? Iris: Oh, why? Are you thirsty, Gregsy? I have some of my special herbal tea with me, if you'd like some! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Ta very much. That really hit the spot...Your Ladyship. Ryunosuke: (I don't even recognise him like this...) After clearing all Converse options: Gregson: Oh...yeah...there's somethin' I was s'posed to talk to you about, actually, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Yes? What is it? Gregson: I've got an important message for you. I clean forgot about it until now. Ryunosuke: An important message? (I wonder what it could be...) 16th April British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: (Yes... ...no matter how many times I come here, I always get the same sense of oppressiveness somehow...) Iris: Do you think the place is oppressive? I think it's normal. Ryunosuke: How so?! Iris: I mean, look at that suit of armour over there. You can't take that seriously, can you? Ryunosuke: ...Maybe it thinks the same about you. ???: ...So everything is clear with regard to tomorrow's arrangements, I trust? ???: Yes. Thank you very much. Ryunosuke: (There they are. Susato-san and Lord Stronghart.) Iris: I wonder what they're talking about. They both look very serious. Stronghart: Very good. There is nothing further to discuss. You may return to your lodgings. No doubt you have much to do in preparation for your return to your homeland. Ryunosuke: ......... (...Wait, what did he just say? 'Your return to your homeland'...?) Susato-san! Susato: ...! Oh! Um...Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: ......... What was all that about? Susato: ......... Stronghart: Ah, Mr Naruhodo. Thank you for coming to collect your colleague. Ryunosuke: What's this all about? Why were you talking about Miss Susato's 'return to her homeland'? And, and... ...tomorrow?! Susato: ......... Iris: Tomorrow...? But what about Ginny's trial? Susato: ...! You mean... ...she's been formally charged now? Oh dear... Iris: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Stronghart: ...Three minutes precisely until my next meeting. You must excuse me. Ryunosuke: ......... There's just...one more thing, Lord Stronghart. Stronghart: Which is? Ryunosuke: It's Miss Lestrade's trial... I wonder if you might permit me to defend her? Stronghart: ......... A timely suggestion. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Stronghart: The girl currently has no representation. Iris: But, but that's not fair! Yes, she may be a pickpocket, but she still deserves a fair trial! Stronghart: ...Do not misunderstand me, young lady. The government provides for those too poor to afford representation with a public defender. The accused need only sign the relevant paperwork, and a defence barrister will be assigned to the case. However...the young girl in question has refused that right. Ryunosuke: Why would she do that? Stronghart: A question you would do well to direct at Miss Lestrade. You'll find her at the local prison. Ryunosuke: Yes, thank you. Stronghart: Now then, it's time I was leaving. Good day to you. Ryunosuke: (What a day. Gina charged with murder... Susato-san about to leave...) Susato: ......... Come, Mr Naruhodo. Iris. We must make haste. Iris: But, Susie... ...you're leaving for Japan tomorrow morning, aren't you? Don't you have packing and things to do? Susato: ......... As Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant, my personal circumstances are of no consequence. My sole purpose remains to help you in whatever way I can. Ryunosuke: ...Thank you, Miss Susato. (That's a very pensive look...) Ryunosuke: (If I'm honest, this has completely thrown me off. I'll just have to do what I can...as a lawyer...) 16th April Local Prison, Cell 13 After clearing all Converse options at Local Prison, Cell 13 and Lord Chief Justice's Office: Susato: Gina... ...I wonder if you might hear me out. There's something I'd like to say. Gina: Wot? Susato: I'm sorry to say...that I must reluctantly bid you farewell. Gina: Eh? Farewell? Susato: Tomorrow, I must begin my journey back home. To Japan. ...I fear we may never meet again. Gina: ...! Oh...right... Susato: I've had the pleasure of meeting so many lovely people here in London. I have so many wonderful memories. And yet...as things stand now... ...it will be a glum parting indeed. Poor Iris is so miserable. Iris: Susie... Gina: Well...well...that ain't my business! Susato: Both Iris and Mr Naruhodo believe you to be innocent, Gina. They've put their faith in you. But somehow...you can't find it in your heart to put your faith in them. Gina: Yeah! That's right, I can't! ...Wot of it? Susato: It grieves me greatly to have to say goodbye to my friends when they are so clearly unhappy... ...because of you. Gina: ...! Wot, it's MY fault?! Susato: Yes. So I have one final request, Gina, before our paths never cross again. Right here and now... ...I want you to show both of them that you don't deserve the faith they've invested in you. Gina: Eh?! Susato: Only by doing that... ...will you truly be as alone as you claim to be. Gina: ...! Wot are you talkin' about? Wot d'you expect me to do, eh? Susato: You've told us that everyone lies. So prove it! ...By admitting one of your own untruths. Gina: ......... Iris: What about what you said before, Ginny? You said something about unforgivable lies. Susato: You must tell Mr Naruhodo and Iris the truth now. That is my last request before I leave. My last request as a judicial assistant. Gina: No... I, I can't... Ryunosuke: (Whatever these lies are, they're obviously weighing very heavily on Gina's mind...) Gina, I could be wrong, but... ...is it something to do with what happened two months ago? Something about that trial? The one in which Magnus McGilded was acquitted? Gina: Ah... Ryunosuke: The case of that mysterious murder that took place inside the omnibus... You were called as a witness by the prosecution. Is that what this is about? Gina: ......... Yeah. You're right. Because...in that trial... ...I lied. I lied like you wouldn't believe. Ryunosuke: ......... Will you tell us about it now? Gina: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Gina: ......... I bet yer ready to string me up, eh? I lied...in that big old courtroom. I told some corkers. Ryunosuke: ......... Gina: The thing is, 'e said 'e would make it so we couldn't live in the East End no more. That's wot 'e threatened me wiv. Iris: What a wicked man... Gina: 'E knew everyfin' wot went on in the back slums. 'E knew we 'ad no one to look after us, and we was all just lookin' out for each other, gettin' by together. Susato: So you mean...Mr McGilded would have- Gina: In an 'eartbeat! 'E could've 'ad the lot of us chased out o' there if 'e'd wanted. And then where could we 'ave gone, eh? Nowhere, that's where! So... I didn't 'ave no choice. ......... Ryunosuke: Thank you, Gina, for telling us everything. Gina: But...I'm for it now, eh?! Go on, admit it! You must be livid! Ryunosuke: Well...you can make amends by doing me a simple favour. Gina: ...A favour? Wot? Ryunosuke: Sign the representation papers for tomorrow's trial. Gina: Eh?! Ryunosuke: If you don't actually want me to represent you in court, you can rip it up later. But we need that paperwork or we can't investigate. The police won't let us. Gina: Investigate wot? Ryunosuke: The scene of the incident last night. Mr Sholmes was shot, you see. Gina: You wot?! Iris: Hurley's having a big operation right now, Ginny. Gina: Is it bad?! Is, is 'e gonna be alright? Sholmes is gonna be alright...right? Iris: ......... Ryunosuke: That's why I want to investigate. For Mr Sholmes's sake as much as anything. Gina: ......... Right. So wot yer sayin' is, if I sign that bit o' paper, everyone's 'appy, is that it? Ryunosuke: Something like that. ...Miss Susato? Susato: Yes! Of course! I have the representation papers here. Gina: ......... ...I, I don't need no one to stick up for me, though. No lawyer or nuffin'. Iris: Poor Ginny... She seems so lonely. Gina's representation papers have been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: Well...at least this should mean we can investigate the scene at Windibank's now. Iris: Yes. And perhaps we can come back to visit Ginny when we're done there? Ryunosuke: (I feel like we've finally cracked Gina. She's opened up to us at last. And now I have her representation papers... No one else knows just what a responsibility that is. Anyway, for now it means Inspector Gregson can't stop us investigating at Windibank's. Although something tells me he's not going to be happy about it...) To be continued... 16th April, 1:26 p.m. Windibank's Pawnbrokery Ryunosuke: (Here we are again at the scene of the crime... Now to thrust these representation papers in Gregson's face and see what he makes of them!) Hello again, Inspector. Do you have a minute, please? Gregson: What is it now? You should go home and get some rest. Iris: Here you are, Gregsy! Here are the representation papers! Gregson: .........Your Ladyship! Hooooooooooooooooooooow?! I don't believe it! How the devil did you get that stubborn little ragabash to sign that?! I salute you! That is good work, that is. Iris: I can see you've been very busy here as well. How about some tea? It's a special blend designed to relieve fatigue! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Well, let's see now... Yes... Yes! I hardly feel tired at all! I'm fit as a fiddle, Your Ladyship! Ryunosuke: ...Would it be alright if we investigated the scene of the crime, then? Gregson: Do as you please! You know where it happened. Through that door behind the counter. Ryunosuke: (Yes, the storeroom... That's where I discovered Mr Windibank...and Gina.) Gregson: Right, well...I'll be gettin' back to business then. Ryunosuke: Will you be investigating in the storeroom as well, Inspector? Gregson: If I'm perfectly honest, we need to wrap this up before long. Can't afford to spend too much time on it. But there are so many articles to go through, it's taking forever, even with the lads workin' round the clock. Which is a problem, 'cause there's another case the Yard needs to investigate urgently. Ryunosuke: (That must be what Lord Stronghart meant by 'far more serious matters' before...) Gregson: So what I'm sayin' is, don't get under my feet, sunshine! Susato: Come then! Let us not waste any time! After clearing all Converse options: Iris: So what do you think of these stereoscopic prints then, Runo? Ryunosuke: They're certainly amazing, but it isn't easy to get the knack of viewing them properly. Iris: No, some people find it easier than others. But that's why contraptions like this exist. For people who find it tricky. Susato: Oh! I recognise that. We saw one over there yesterday, didn't we? If I remember correctly, you press this little knob here... ...then set the pair of photographs in this stand at the back and... Ryunosuke: It's still amazing, even though I know roughly how it works now. Iris: Well, London seems to agree with you. Stereoscopes are very popular at the moment. You can find one of these folding contraptions in lots of households in the capital currently. Ryunosuke: But if these little machines are so affordable... ...surely there's no need to go around staring cross-eyed at pictures like you hate them. Iris: ......... But it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Well, I think so, in any case. Ryunosuke: (Stereoscopic pictures... I'd never even heard of them until yesterday. We've certainly learnt a lot about them. But I wonder if it's knowledge that I'll ever actually need...) The second white cat photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Iris: Oh! That looks like blood! Ryunosuke: I would say it's from a gloved finger. Almost certainly a glove made of leather. iris: Well don't worry, Runo! You can leave the rest to me! Ryunosuke: Look at that... Iris: Yes, that's a colour we haven't seen before, isn't it? Susato: We simply must add it to the portfolio of blood samples! It could be an important clue. Although...it would be nice to find out whose blood these different colours correspond to at some point. Ryunosuke: ......... (Well, this particular stain of blood...) Iris: Oh! You've had an idea, haven't you? Do you know whose blood this is? Ryunosuke: Yes, I have an idea whose blood it is. Not from the colour it turned, but with a little deduction. Iris: That's right! I think it's clear. Susato: Iris, you know as well? Iris: You first, Runo. Who do you think it belongs to? Ryunosuke: Alright, I believe that this is the blood of... Ryunosuke: ...'Thrice-Fired' Mason...? Iris: You don't sound very sure of yourself, the way you trailed off there. Ryunosuke: Well it was two months ago now, that case. And of course I'd never met the victim. So I'm struggling to remember his name. He was definitely 'Thrice-Fired', though. Susato: The victim...of the omnibus case? Yes, his name was indeed Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason. But that would mean that this bloodstain... ...was left on the ticket two months ago! Ryunosuke: Yes. I think it was. Gina brought this ticket here to Windibank's yesterday. I'm suggesting that the bloodstain was already on it at that time. Iris: So it's a smear of blood from the time that Mr Mason was killed two months ago! Susato: Something else is coming back to me now... Mr McGilded was also wearing leather gloves that night. McGilded: Now I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand. Ryunosuke: It certainly does look like a leather-gloved thumbprint, this mark. But we know that Mr McGilded had no injuries at the time, anywhere on his body. From which we can conclude... ...that any blood on the glove...belonged to the victim, Mr Mason! Susato: Mr Naruhodo! You sound just like Mr Sholmes! Ryunosuke: (...Minus the quirky slip-ups, I hope.) Iris: Yes, I think you're right, Runo! Susato: Very well. Let's make a note of this. The details of the pawnbroker's ticket for the coat have been updated in the Court Record. The blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record. 16th April Local Prison, Cell 13 Ryunosuke: Gina doesn't appear to be here. Susato: I believe she must be in questioning at the moment. Iris: Oh, but...wait a minute... Ryunosuke: What is it, Iris? Iris: Well if you examine the scene here carefully, there's another possibility, isn't there? Ginny could have slipped the key from the jailer when he wasn't looking and escaped! Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: Why, why would she do something like that? It would only make her situation worse! Iris: ......... Calm down, Runo! I was only joking of course! Ryunosuke: ......... Oh. Ugh...you had me worried there. I thought it was a 'great deduction'. Susato: Yes, it must be your way with words, Iris. You're so wonderfully persuasive. Perhaps you don't fully understand the weight your words carry. Iris: Oh dear... I'm sorry. I suppose a light-hearted great detective is a contradiction in terms. Ryunosuke: Well, in the same situation, I'm sure Mr Sholmes would just have thrown his head back and guffawed. Susato: I'm not entirely sure that's helpful, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Well anyway, it looks like we won't be able to talk to Gina for a while. We should try to make progress with our investigation in the meantime. Iris: Yes. Come along then, Runo! Come along, Susie! 16th April Windibank's Storeroom Iris: ......... Ryunosuke: (Poor Iris... She's clammed up completely.) Susato: Iris is bound to find this difficult. After all, Mr Windibank's life was taken in this very room only last night. Iris: ......... Gregson: .........Ah! Ryunosuke: Wait! Inspector! Gregson: What is it now, sunshine? Ryunosuke: You took one look at me and tried to run away! Gregson: You think a Scotland Yard inspector would run away from some jumped-up little defence lawyer, do ya? Iris: ......... Gregson: I just! Well... ...I've never seen Her Ladyship lookin' like that before, is the thing. I didn't know what to say to her. Ryunosuke: (So you weren't running away from me...you were running away from a ten-year-old.) Susato: I'm afraid this is all a little much for young Iris. Some gentle reassurance might go a long way perhaps, Inspector. Gregson: Eh?! Iris: ......... Gregson: Erm... Ahem! Don't, um... Don't trouble yourself unduly, Your Ladyship. I mean...at least you're not dead, are you? Ryunosuke: ...I don't think that went very well. Gregson: ......... WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! Look! I'm in the middle of an investigation here, sunshine! And I told you not to get under my feet! Susato: And we have investigating to do ourselves. Ryunosuke: Yes. I'd like to hear more of what the socially inept inspector has to say. Iris: Oh Hurley... Ryunosuke: (And enquire into how Mr Sholmes's operation is going...) After clearing all Converse options, examining calendar, and presenting Pawnbroker's Ticket (Coat) in Windibank's Main Shop, and clearing all Converse options, examining chalk outline, red chest, and revolver in Windibank's Storeroom: *Dong* *Dong* *Dong* Iris: AAAAAAGH!!! I nearly jumped out of my skin there! How could Mr Windibank set such a wicked trap?! Ryunosuke: I...I doubt he set out to scare anyone. Susato: Is that really the time? I think perhaps we should pay Gina another visit soon. Ryunosuke: Oh? Susato: Her trial is tomorrow. We must establish whether or not you will be defending her. I think we should ask her one more time. ...She may have changed her mind. Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: Don't you remember, Runo? You told her she could rip up the representation papers if she didn't want you to be her lawyer. Ryunosuke: ...Really? Did I say that? Yes. You did. Susato: The deadline for submitting the paperwork is fast approaching. Ryunosuke: (In that case, we had better hurry back to the prison and talk to Gina again.) 16th April, 5:41 p.m. Local Prison, Cell 13 Ryunosuke: Ah, Gina, good... You're back. Gina: Ah! ......... Susato: The police must have finished questioning her, then. Iris: Oh, how was it, Ginny? Was it awful? Gina: Eh? Oh... Didn't bother me. Ryunosuke: Thank you for the papers you signed before. It meant we were able to investigate at Windibank's. Gina: Oh...right... ......... Iris: Don't you want to know how we got on? We've been ever so busy. Gina: ......... Wot's the point in askin'? Won't change wot everyone's sayin'. That I did it. Iris: That's not... Gina: ......... Ryunosuke: Gina, we came to ask for your final decision. Gina: Eh? Wot decision? Ryunosuke: About tomorrow's trial. Will you let me defend you or not? Gina: ...! Susato: I must submit the paperwork now if you'd like Mr Naruhodo to represent you. Gina: Right...I see... Ryunosuke: (She's really lost her fight all of a sudden. But I know what that feels like. The worry is just so hard to bear...) Ryunosuke: Those stains on the sleeves of your new coat, Gina... They're blood, aren't they? Not that I know whose blood yet. Gina: WOT?! Susato: B-Blood, Mr Naruhodo?! Ryunosuke: You don't appear to have any obvious wounds yourself, though. So could it be blood that spattered from Mr Windibank when he was shot last night? Iris: Let's not beat around the bush here. This trusty friend of mine will get results much faster than anything else! Gina: Eh?! T-Take it easy, Iris! Iris: Don't move, Ginny! I'm going to shoot! Oh... Susato: Oh my! Ryunosuke: What the...? Forget the sleeves... Iris: ...The whole coat is covered in blood! Ryunosuke: (Of course! The black colour of the fabric was masking the stains. That's why we haven't seen them until now!) Susato: And the blood has reacted with the chemical to turn a purple colour... ...which matches one of the samples we've already collected perfectly! Iris: Yes, now let's see...who had the purple blood? Aha! Yes, it was the brickmaker, Mr Mason. The victim of the murder case two months ago. Ryunosuke: ......... (I knew it...) Gina: Wot, wot are you all on about? The victim? Wot d'you mean? Susato: ......... It's a rather uncomfortable situation, Mr Naruhodo, but I think this makes things quite clear. It means the omnibus case is finally solved. The truth about who really murdered the brickmaker, Mr Mason...is revealed. Gina: Oi! Would someone explain wot's goin' on?! Stop tellin' 'alf a story! Susato: ......... After clearing all Converse options: Susato: Gina...may I ask you something? Gina: Wot? Susato: I'd just like to make absolutely sure... What would you like us to do with these representation papers for tomorrow's trial? Gina: ......... 'Ow many times do I 'ave to say it? Rip 'em up and chuck 'em away. Susato: Are you really sure that's what you want? Gina: I bet that's wot 'e wants an' all now. Mr 'I'm-a-Believer' Lawyer over there. Ryunosuke: ......... Gina: Don't forget it was me in that trial two months ago. I led everyone up the garden path, didn't I? An' yer tellin' me you can believe in me after that? Not likely. Susato: ......... Well, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: (A lawyer's primary weapon is an unwavering belief in his clients... Ultimately it comes down to whether or not I feel I can trust Gina after everything that's happened...) Ryunosuke: Gina...let me say it again... Please allow me to represent you in tomorrow's trial. Gina: Eh? Are you 'alf-baked? Ryunosuke: Not at all. You've not once admitted to committing the crime, have you? What's more...I believe that you're telling me the truth. Gina: ......... Seriously, um...Mr Narrow-'Oddo... ...didn't you 'ear all of wot I said before? I'm a born liar. Fibs just trip off me tongue. And I'm a diver, don't forget. I pulled the wool over yer eyes two months ago and got you into all sorts o' trouble. Why would you ever trust me now? I just don't get it! Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Gina... Gina: ...! Susato: ...I do understand why you choose not to put your trust in others. But I assure you, there is more to this life than you yet realise. Gina: Wot d'you mean? Susato: The world we live in... ...is full of people you would do very well to trust. People who won't ever let you down. Gina: Eh? Ryunosuke: It's true that I'm just a student of law, and I'm certainly lacking in courtroom experience. But I can promise you this: Whatever happens...and until my very last breath... ...I am completely on your side! Gina: ......... Wot...wot d'you expect me to say to that? ......... Susato: Then it's decided. I will take these papers now and carry out the necessary preparations for tomorrow's trial. It would be a shame to throw them away now after it's been penned with your name so beautifully. Gina: ...Do wot you like. You Eastern lot are...are... I dunno wot you are! I don't get ya! Ryunosuke: (Gina's taken herself off to the back of her cell. She'd never admit it, but I hope she's feeling relieved. That turned out alright in the end...I think.) ........................... Susato: Whoever's hiding there... ...show yourself at once! Eavesdropping is the height of cowardice! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato?! Susato: Somebody is there in the shadows. I can sense it. Somebody who wasn't there before! Ryunosuke: What?! ???: ......... ...Blimey, you're sharp, eh? Gregson: I s'pose you were usin' one of those mystic Japanese arts. Like the art of stealth I've heard so much about. Ryunosuke: ...If anyone was being stealthy, it was you, Inspector. Iris: Gregsy! Gregson: Oh dear me, I am most terribly sorry, Your Ladyship! I didn't mean to startle you! Iris: How long have you been listening in on our conversation? Gregson: Good grief! Listenin' in?! No no no! I just got word that there were some visitors who were refusin' to leave even though it was after hours. I assure you, Your Ladyship, I only just arrived. This very minute! Not a moment earlier! That's all it is! Nothin' untoward! Nothin' at all! Ryunosuke: After hours...? Is it that late already? Gregson: So then, I'll humbly excuse myself now, Your Ladyship. Ta-ta! Toodle-oo! Cheerio! All the best! Bye, by and by! Ryunosuke: (That's a lot of farewells, and not one of them appropriate for 'Her Ladyship'.) Iris: Oh, but I wanted to have a chat! Gregson: I'm, I'm terribly sorry, but time is pressin' at the minute. Iris: Oh, I see. ...That's a shame. Gregson: If I don't get this emergency at the Supreme Court dealt with sharpish, Lord  Stronghart will, well... Iris: Emergency?! Ryunosuke: Lord Stronghart? Gregson: Nothin'! Forget I said anythin'! Anyway...ahem! I'm off! Iris: Alright, Gregsy, if you have to. But let's chat soon! Gregson: Delighted! Charmed! Can't wait! If you please! My pleasure! Ryunosuke: (That's a lot of pleasantries, and not one of them sounded sincere...) Iris: Gregsy's so funny! He says such silly things! Ryunosuke: It's certainly entertaining to see an inspector of the police fawning to a ten-year-old girl. (But anyway, I wonder what this emergency is at the Supreme Court...) Susato: I must attend the court clerk's office now before it closes. Ryunosuke: Yes, of course. Thank you, Miss Susato. Susato: ......... Kindly escort Iris home now, Mr Naruhodo. I shall meet you there later. Ryunosuke: And so our investigation came to an end. Susato-san went to file the necessary papers for my defence of Gina the following day. And then it hit me... I could no longer suppress the wretched feeling that had been gnawing away at my insides. Tomorrow...Susato-san would be leaving. Leaving Britain and making her way back to Japan. 16th April, 11:13 p.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Susato: Naruhodo-san... ...it's been a very trying day, hasn't it? I do hope you're not too exhausted. Ryunosuke: What about you, Susato-san? Today has been even more trying for you, I'm sure. (Mr Sholmes was shot before our eyes, Gina was arrested... ...all on the back of the news that her father has fallen ill and that she must return to Japan at once.) I...hope your father recovers soon. Susato: Thank you for your kind words. ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: I wonder why it is... ...that so many thoughts rage in my head like a storm... ...and yet I seem unable to find the words to express any of them. Ryunosuke: I know exactly what you mean. Susato: Anyway, I have one final task to complete as your judicial assistant. Once that is done, I shall make preparations for my departure tomorrow. Ryunosuke: (One final task...?) After clearing all Converse options: Susato: Well...it's getting rather late. I think you should go to bed now, Naruhodo-san. I must finish packing up my things in my room. Ryunosuke: Susato-san, I... Susato: I wish you the very best of luck tomorrow! ...Good night. Ryunosuke: Wait! There's, there's something I need to say! Susato: Haiiiiii-YA! Ryunosuke: What, what was that...? Susato: A secret technique of mine... The 'Susato Shutdown'. Ryunosuke: Shutdown? Susato: ......... Please...I implore you... If we have to voice our goodbyes... ...I won't be able to hold back my tears. Ryunosuke: ......... Susato-san... It truly had been a trying day. On our feet for hours... Getting Gina to open up to us... And learning the truth about that nemesis of a case. Physically and mentally, I was exhausted. And yet the idea of sleep seemed impossible. But I forced myself to close my eyes... ...eventually...my fatigue triumphed, and I fell into a deep sleep. ...................................................... 17th April, the Small Hours St Synner's Hospital, Ward 3 ???: ...Yes, I quite understand. ???: That is a great weight off my mind. Sholmes: Rest assured, I shall put everything in place, exactly as we have discussed. ???: Thank you so much. It has been an honour and a pleasure to be acquainted with you, Mr Sholmes. Sholmes: On the contrary. The pleasure has been mine. I bid you farewell...and Godspeed... ...my dear madam. To be continued...\nNash: We woz walkin' down Baker Street in the small hours, an' the gaff's door was ajar, see?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The front door of Windibank's was ajar, you say? What time of night was this? Nash: Must've been about one. ...Right, Ringo? Ringo: Yeah, I'd say so. ...Right, Sulky? Gregson: How would I know? The place would've been shut at one in the mornin'. Just like every other shop in town. Nash: Well it woz pitch-black inside, it's true. ...Ain't that right, Ringo? Ringo: I'm not so sure, Nash. I seem to remember a little light burnin' inside. Wot about you, Sulky, me old mucker? Gregson: ...Leave me alone. Ryunosuke: (There definitely was a small lamp burning inside. That's what alerted us to the situation in the first place.) Van Zieks: And when these gentlemen ventured into the open establishment... ...the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, already had the muzzle of her gun trained on the unfortunate victim. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That is pure conjecture! Judge: Hmmm... Van Zieks: Hah, perhaps. But it changes nothing. These brothers inadvertently wandered into the middle of a cold-blooded murder... ...simply because they found the door of the victim's establishment open and ventured inside. Nash: Right! That's wot 'appened!Ringo: It woz like some kinda sign. Beggin' for us to go in, it woz!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What are you trying to suggest? That you had to go in? Nash: Well, God moves in mysterious ways, they say, dun't they, Ringo? Ringo: They do, Nash, they do. Must've been some sort o' providence, I reckon. Ryunosuke: ...God's will often presents itself as the whim of thieves, does it? Nash: It weren't no whim. I'm dead sure o' that. Ringo: It weren't, Nash, it weren't. Like we said at the time... Nash: ...Ya don't just find doors open in the middle o' the night like that. Nah, there's no two ways about it... Ringo: ...It woz a sign that our long-lost bruvver was inside! Iris: They're not very good liars, are they? Ringo: Well...ya can't deny it. It led us to a bloke wot looks just like our bruv! Gregson: ...I said, cut it out. Ryunosuke: (Those chips are getting a chomping today...)Nash: But once we got inside, cor blimey lummy! We 'eard a gunshot from the back room!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A gunshot, you say. Just the one. Are you sure about that? Nash: Yup, just the one, guvnor. I can swear to that. Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. ...Ain't that right, Bruv? Gregson: ...The firearm used belonged to the victim himself. Iris: Yes, Mr Windibank always used to leave his gun lying around on the counter. Ryunosuke: Right. I remember. Gregson: When we examined it, we found the revolver was completely out of rounds. Iris: That makes sense. Mr Windibank always used to say he only ever kept a single bullet loaded. Ryunosuke: (That's true. I remember him saying that as well.) Judge: So we can say with considerable certainty... ...that only a single round was discharged from the firearm used as the murder weapon. Gregson: Yes, My Lord. We can. Van Zieks: And I should remind the court... ...that the firearm in question was discovered in the hand of the accused. Judge: Hmmm... Ryunosuke: (...Wonderful.)Ringo: We went to see wot woz wot, but the door was locked from the inside.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you mean the door between the main shop and the storeroom? Van Zieks: If my learned friend is having difficulty grasping the situation, perhaps a drawing would help. Excluding the shop's entrance from the street, there is only one other door. That of the storeroom. Nash: 'Course there woz only a little oil lamp burnin'. Not much to see by. Ringo: An' the door woz 'idden be'ind a curtain an' all. Ryunosuke: (That's right. When we arrived, the door was mostly obscured by the curtain.) Tell me... ...why exactly did you try to open that door? Ringo: Eh? Ryunosuke: Any normal petty thief would run at the sound of a gunshot, I should think. Nash: Oh, well, erm...your turn to rabbit, Ringo. Ringo: Well, Nash, erm...yeah... ...I s'pose...you'd 'ave to say we ain't 'normal', eh? Van Zieks: Broadly speaking, humans respond in one of two ways on hearing a gunshot or scream: The timid flee, gripped by fear, while the courageous investigate to see if they might help. These gentlemen are of the latter inclination. My learned Nipponese friend, it would seem, is of the former. Ryunosuke: (Alright... Somehow I just proved that I was a coward that night...) Judge: Thank you, Counsels... So, I believe we all understand that the door was locked and could not be opened. Proceed, witnesses...Nash: We never done nuffin', guvnor! We never took nuffin'! We just left after that, nice an' quiet.Press Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"You didn't do or take anything...\"Iris: What do you think about this pair, Runo?Ryunosuke: I think they're lying through their teeth, that's what I think. And I'm going to prove it!Iris: .........Ryunosuke: What is it, Iris?Iris: Weeell...I'm not really sure. There's just something a bit funny...about that prosecutor over there.Ryunosuke: Hm? (Wait, could this... ...could this testimony be some sort of a trap?)Ryunosuke: You didn't do or take anything... Is that your story?Nash: Well it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: So with no time to take your hands out of your pockets, you just left, nice and quietly, you say?Nash: That's right, guvnor. Nuffin' we 'ate more than violence. Peace-lovin' nibblers, we are, not bludgers.Ringo: We are, Nash, we are. Never even pulled me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: ...So, you'd clearly like us to believe...Nash: Eh? Come again...?Ryunosuke: As you fled from the pawnbroker's that night... ...did you not run into anyone else?Nash: Um...Ryunosuke: And...did you not fire a gun at that person?!Ringo: Erm...Judge: Saints alive! They fired a gun, you say?Nash: AAAAAAGH!!! Blimey, guvnor!Ringo: You ain't tellin' us it woz you in the doorway?!Ryunosuke: It was.Ringo: ......... Why the bleedin' Nora...Nash: ...Didn't ya mention that before?!Ryunosuke: You were armed with a gun. And as you fled the scene, you fired that gun... ...at London's greatest detective, Herlock Sholmes!They shot the great Mr Sholmes? I did hear that, actually. There was a rumour he'd been rushed to hospital....The great Sholmes? That's beyond the pale!Van Zieks: On the night in question... ...this pair were arrested by the police within minutes of the discovery of the crime scene. ...Their suspicious countenance rapidly gave them away.Ringo: Hehe...Van Zieks: And when searched... ...a firearm was indeed found in their possession.Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Van Zieks: Furthermore, the barrel shows signs of a shot having been fired from it.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Van Zieks: The prosecution invites His Lordship to examine the firearm recovered from these brothers.Judge: Yes, indeed... Remnants of powder around the muzzle, as you say, Counsel.Juror No. 5: ...!Juror No. 6: ...!Judge: The court will hold this weapon as evidence.The Skulkin brothers' gun has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: Now, my learned Nipponese friend...Examine evidence Skulkin Brothers' Gun Bullet cylinder Ryunosuke: So, there's ammunition still loaded in five of this revolver's six cylinders. Iris: Yes, which tell us that only a single shot has been fired from it. Ryunosuke: Exactly. Iris: The bullet that hit Hurley in fact, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes... It happened almost as soon as we'd walked in through Windibank's door. Iris: ......... I'll make those brothers pay.Ryunosuke: Y-Yes?Van Zieks: Here's to you successfully presenting the evidence.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: For yes, there are the telltale signs of spent powder on this gun, and a single bullet missing from the cylinder... ...but the prosecution demands evidence that it was fired at the scene of the crime under scrutiny in this trial!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Well, I don't need evidence! Because I was there!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ...However, the rest of us in this courtroom were not.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: If the defence fails to provide evidence in support of its rash claim... ...we shall have no choice but to toast your incompetence...and move on.Ryunosuke: (Evidence that these two fired that gun before they left Windibank's that night...)Judge: The court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof. What evidence shows that these witnesses unloaded a firearm in the pawnbroker's shop that night?Present Blood Samples Portfolio Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The evidence...is in this portfolio!\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The evidence...is this! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: My learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"The court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof.\"Ryunosuke: The evidence...is in this portfolio!Judge: What, what on earth have you there, Counsel?Ryunosuke: During the course of our investigations, we discovered a number of bloodstains.Van Zieks: ...Not trusting the police to do the job they're trained to do? How arrogantly Nipponese of you.Ryunosuke: W-Well anyway... ...we analysed all the blood samples we found and recorded the results in this portfolio.Judge: And you claim to have the evidence the court is demanding therein?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord.Judge: No more dallying then, Counsel. Present the pertinent evidence at once! What do you have in your portfolio that proves these witnesses unloaded a firearm at the scene?Present Windibank's Main Shop sample Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"What is that? Explain!\"Present any other sample Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: THIS is the blood sample that proves it! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"No more dallying then, Counsel.\"Judge: What is that? Explain!Ryunosuke: It's a photographic print taken at Windibank's pawnbrokery on the day of the incident.Judge: From the scene of the crime, is it? Is, is that... ...a bullet hole? And if my eyes do not deceive me, it appears the bullet is still lodged there.Ryunosuke: Yes, as Your Lordship noticed... ...the bullet pierced Mr Windibank's calendar. The date shown being the 16th of April - the very day of the pawnbroker's death.Judge: The incident occurred at one hour after midnight. But this indicates that a separate shot had been fired sometime after the calendar had been set to the 16th!Ryunosuke: That's right. And while it isn't irrefutable, the defence believes... ...this is credible evidence that the witnesses did fire a round from their gun in the pawnbroker's that night!Nash: NAAAAAAAAAH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! ...How does the prosecution stand, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: ......... If that is the direction my learned friend wishes to take, the prosecution has no objection.Ryunosuke: What?Van Zieks: But you'll forgive me for flinging my hallowed chalice aside in disgust at the repugnancy it exposes. Yes. On the night in question, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery illegally... ...and like the bold 'baddies' they claim to be, opened fire on the new arrivals before fleeing back onto the street!Nash: EEEEEEH?! Take it easy there, guvnor! Yer gonna land us in the soup!Ringo: We 'ad a deal! You weren't gonna get into them...details. Tell 'im, Sulky! Set the bloke straight!Gregson: ...I have nothin' to add.Ryunosuke: (So he knew, did he? Van Zieks knew their testimony would almost certainly expose the extent of their crimes.)Van Zieks: It would seem now... ...that I owe my learned Nipponese friend a word of gratitude.Ryunosuke: What do you mean?Van Zieks: What I mean...is that you have helpfully confirmed an important fact.Judge: To what fact do you refer, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: As has been established, at the point of their arrest, a single shot had been fired from the brothers' gun. However, if that shot found its target in Mr Sholmes... ...then clearly these witnesses cannot be accused of the fatal shooting of the proprietor and victim.Ryunosuke: Agh!Van Zieks: In other words...these two men... ...have no material connection to the murder of Mr Windibank at all!Ryunosuke: ...! (So that's it...)Nash: That's it! We didn't 'ave nuffin' to do wiv it!Ringo: We didn't, Nash, we didn't! That's wot I reckon!Van Zieks: Your crimes include unlawful entry, intent to steal, perjury and - let us not forget - attempted murder.Gregson: Quite a catalogue, eh, fellas?Nash: Ah...Ringo: We're in for it now, bruv...Van Zieks: Now then... ...let us take a moment to consider the aforementioned 'great detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes. It would seem the man patronised the pawnbroker's in question somewhat regularly.Ryunosuke: (Where's he going with this?)Van Zieks: Mr Sholmes appears to take pleasure in tinkering with eccentric machinery.Iris: 'Eccentric'? Says who?!Ryunosuke: ...Not me. Don't give me that look!Van Zieks: He installed a pair of machines like this one in the victim's shop.Iris: Oh! That's one of Hurley's 'Red-Handed Recorders'!Judge: What is that, Counsel? It has the appearance of a photographic contraption.Van Zieks: As Your Lordship has surmised, it is indeed a camera attached to a small timing device.Ryunosuke: Every half an hour, it automatically photographs the interior of the establishment. The idea being that if a thief were to break in to the shop, he would be caught red-handed.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: The prosecution has obtained the photographs taken by the device on the night in question. As the court will observe, copious identical prints are produced in a quite desultory fashion.Judge: Hmph, rather prodigal, I feel.Van Zieks: In fact there are two such devices in the victim's shop, My Lord. If I may refer the court to the plan of the premises, their respective positions are here...and here.Judge: You say these cameras produce a print every half hour. I'm afraid I fail to see... ...how that would help if the anticipated thief conducted his activities in one of the many thirty-minute intervals.Van Zieks: One can only pray that the would-be criminal lingers, My Lord.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: On the night in question, the witnesses currently in the stand were not caught on camera.Nash: Hehe, that's a bit o' Friar Tuck, eh, bruv?Ringo: Lady Luck luvs a Skulkin!Judge: Witnesses, at what time did your trespassing begin?Nash: Eh? ...Must've been just after one. ...Right, bruv?Ringo: Must've been, Nash, must've been. Yeah, just gone one.Van Zieks: In which case, minutes before these brothers entered the establishment... ...what scene might we expect to see within the shop? Let us examine the evidence...Judge: Good Lord! It's...it's the defendant! Miss Gina Lestrade!Van Zieks: As the court can clearly see... ...the accused is pictured, gun in hand, facing the victim over the shop counter. No doubt coercing the proprietor to open the door to his storeroom.Judge: Quite! One can only too easily imagine the events that unfolded. The court will take this photographic print as evidence, if you please, Counsel.The photograph of Gina has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke: Ugh...Iris: I, I don't believe it! Ginny...Van Zieks: In short... ...the accused is the only person who could possibly have killed Mr Windibank.Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!???:I say, My Lord...Juror No. 1: Wonder if I might put in a word at this point.Judge: Go ahead, Mr Foreman.Juror No. 1: Took a bally bullet to the knee in the Battle of Maiwand, 1880, don't you know. Decorated for it and all that, but forced to retire from service, sadly. 'Course, a medal can never outshine the exploits of chaps like us on the battlefield.Judge: Yes, Mr Foreman, and...? What exactly is your point?Juror No. 1: Carried on the battle after retirement, you see. The battle of daily life, if you like. And here I am now, leading this small squadron. Six men, all good and true. And we'll all go down together, you mark my words! One for all...and all for one!Van Zieks: ...The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have reached agreement, have they? Is that what we are to understand?Judge: Well, Mr Foreman? Is that correct?Juror No. 1: ......... In a manner of speaking...yes. That is the Garrideb Squadron's position, sir!Ryunosuke: What?! No! It's too soon to make a judgement here!Juror No. 1: Status report for the court, men! On the double!Juror No. 2: His Lordship insists on promptitude at all times. And that goes for making decisions, too.Juror No. 3: I think you'll find the truth is as clear as day now! I could reach out and touch it!Juror No. 4: I wouldn't have left it in there. I just wouldn't. But in all honesty, I can't actually remember...Juror No. 5: Situation clear. Stop. No room for doubt. Stop. Truth now undeniable. Stop.Juror No. 6: I am wery sorry for brothers. They are unlucky.Judge: Very well... ...I now call upon each member of the jury to state his or her leaning in this matter. Announce your considered verdicts to the court!Juror No. 1: Guilty!Juror No. 2: Guilty!Juror No. 3: Guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Guilty!Judge: It does indeed appear that the jury is unanimous in its leaning already.Ryunosuke: (That photograph... It must be the definitive evidence that Gregson mentioned!)Iris: But Ginny didn't shoot him!Ryunosuke: No, of course not! My Lord! The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination!Judge: Very well. The court grants permission.Van Zieks: So...you refuse to admit defeat again. How...unsurprising.Judge: We shall proceed immediately with the summation examination. Mr Foreman, are all members of the jury ready?Juror No. 1: Abso-bally-lutely, sir! Always ready for action, my chaps!Judge: ...Very good. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have determined the defendant to be guilty!Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1: All the evidence clearly points the finger of guilt at this young pickpocketienne.Juror No. 2: As a housemaid, I should like to see all filthy eyesores promptly and rigorously eliminated.Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you look at that photograph in stereo, the truth will just pop out.Juror No. 4: If I have left it in there, I should think there'll be repercussions by now...Juror No. 5: Mind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.Juror No. 6: In motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.Judge: Hmmm... The circumstance of the crime and the evidence do indeed implicate the defendant rather comprehensively.Van Zieks: The storeroom, locked from the inside, in which the victim and the accused were discovered alone. And in the accused's hand, the fatal revolver, the firing of which was heard by these witnesses.Juror No. 1: Not to mention this print! Take it from a chap whose [sic] seen action on the battlefield: That young girl's on the verge of pulling the bally trigger!Ryunosuke: (...Thanks a lot, Mr Sholmes.)Iris: Oh dear... Hurley's cameras were supposed to help, not hinder.Judge: I'm afraid I think you have an uphill struggle ahead of you.Ryunosuke: (But Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank. Which means there's more to this situation that we've yet to see.)Iris: Agreed!Judge: You have the floor, Counsel. Proceed with the summation examination!Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1: All the evidence clearly points the finger of guilt at this young pickpocketienne.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You're Mr Natsume's landlord, Mr Garrideb...aren't you? We really must stop meeting like this. Juror No. 1: ......... Ah, you're that lawyer chap. Well, there's a turn-up for the books! Yes, rather a turbulent time we had back then. Ryunosuke: Some extraordinary events took place at your house, that's for sure. Luckily Mr Sholmes and I were able to get to the bottom of it all. Juror No. 1: ...! Ryunosuke: I think we did rather a lot for you, didn't we? Juror No. 1: ......... Ryunosuke: I mean, obviously... ...I wouldn't be suggesting that therefore you should change your leaning to not guilty or anything! Juror No. 1: ......... Hmph. Can't be denied, I suppose. The 'curse of the Garrideb house' was the talk of the town after that business. Lodgers moved out, and I couldn't get a bally soul to take up the tenancies. Ryunosuke: Oh. Juror No. 1: Haven't had the heart to break the news to Joanie yet. Bad enough that the old girl's clapped up. Yes, can't be denied...you did do rather a lot. But not for us, that's for dashed certain. Ryunosuke: I suppose not... Juror No. 1: 'Course... ...there can be no suggestion of that being the reason I'm leaning towards guilty here, obviously. Ryunosuke: (...Obviously. But honestly... ...I really wish he'd pay more attention to the trial, and less to juror number two.)Juror No. 2: As a housemaid, I should like to see all filthy eyesores promptly and rigorously eliminated.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...Polishing the bench, I see...again. Juror No. 2: A maid's work is never done. Not a blemish must remain. Ryunosuke: Um, what exactly do you mean by 'filthy eyesores'? Juror No. 2: On my way to market for His Lordship, I have to pass through the East End. The place is full of beggars, pickpurses and crossmen. The scum of the earth! Ryunosuke: ...A little harsh, perhaps. Juror No. 2: Let me be plain... If it were up to me, all those back slums would be made spick and span or eradicated. At least we have people like the great detective working to achieve these important goals. Ryunosuke: You're referring to Mr Herlock Sholmes? Juror No. 2: That's right. I like to keep abreast of his exploits by reading Randst Magazine in between my duties. He does wonders, cleaning up London's streets. In my opinion, he should be declared an honorary maid of the capital. Ryunosuke: ...Mr Sholmes? ...A maid? Juror No. 2: It's really quite unforgivable... Gutter scum having the audacity to shoot our very greatest detective! Ryunosuke: ......... Minor detail: It was the two brothers in the stand who shot Mr Sholmes, not the defendant. Juror No. 2: A minor detail indeed. They're all gutter scum as far as I'm concerned! Ryunosuke: Weeell...it just might be an idea to get our facts straight anyway... Juror No. 2: ...Yes, alright. I shall amend my statement. Changes Juror No. 2's statement to \"Those brothers are the scum of the earth! They should swing for shooting the great detective!\"Juror No. 2: Those brothers are the scum of the earth! They should swing for shooting the great detective!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I agree with you. The shooting of Mr Sholmes was an unforgivable act. But the purpose of this trial is to determine who shot the pawnbroker, Mr Windibank. Juror No. 2: ...I'm afraid you're splitting hairs, sir. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Juror No. 2: Whether it was the thieves or the pickpurse... ...it was still gutter trash that shot the pawnbroker in the end. Filth that should be cleaned up and eradicated...in my considered opinion. Ryunosuke: (Thanks so much for sharing. ...Changing this maid's mind isn't going to be easy.) Iris: Runo... ...it was one of those two brothers that shot Hurley, wasn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes. Without question. Iris: Well then I'll never forgive them! Ryunosuke: Oh, Iris... Iris: Perhaps we can use this maid's statement to help us somehow, do you think? Ryunosuke: Yes, maybe. Let's listen carefully to what each juror has to say first...Pit against Juror No. 6's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself! Juror No.2: Oh my! My statement? Contradictory? Juror No. 6: Contradict... C-o-n... Ryunosuke: Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick. Juror No. 6: ...I do not have stick. I have mouse. Ryunosuke: As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver. Juror No. 2: Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand! Ryunosuke: ...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d... Ryunosuke: ...Sir? Juror No. 6: Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning. Ryunosuke: ...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Forgive me. I did not hear. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 6: ...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker. Ryunosuke: (...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!) Juror No. 6: So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative. Ryunosuke: Yes! That's exactly right! Juror No. 6: Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal! Ryunosuke: ...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced. Juror No. 6: This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?! Ryunosuke: Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so... Juror No. 6: Enough! I trust no one now! Ryunosuke: ...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir. Juror No. 6: I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself! Ryunosuke: I'm afraid that won't be poss- Iris: Yes it is, Runo! Easily! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder! Ryunosuke: Ah... Iris: If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor! Van Zieks: Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight. Iris: So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken. Ryunosuke: (That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.) Juror No. 6: So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing. Ryunosuke: It would seem so, yes. Juror No. 6: Good. Ryunosuke: No, not good. Juror No. 6: You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial. Iris: Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting! Ryunosuke: Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still! Judge: Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence. The post-shooting photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: (Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...) Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.\"Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you look at that photograph in stereo, the truth will just pop out.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you mean, 'look at the photograph in stereo'? Juror No. 3: Sorry? What? Don't, don't you know? If you look at the photographic print normally... ...it looks as though the pickpocket girl is about to shoot the victim, obviously. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But there's no indication that the defendant ever fired the gun! Juror No. 3: All I'm saying is that if you look at the same print in stereo, it could reveal all sorts of new information. Ryunosuke: ......... By any chance... ...are you a fan of stereoscopes? Juror No. 3: Ooooooh! How did you know?! Ryunosuke: ...Let's call it a lucky guess. Juror No. 3: It never gets old, seeing the two prints merge into one before your eyes! It's extraordinary! It's captivating! It's the height of modernity! Ryunosuke: ...Of course. Juror No. 3: Oh yes! I think you'll find that the stereoscope is here to stay! Giving us new perspectives we could only dream of before, it's the greatest invention the world has ever seen! Ryunosuke: (...If only it could give me a new perspective on this case, I might agree with you.)Juror No. 3: All we'd need is another shot from a slightly different location, and we could see the scene in three dimensions!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Can it really show up new clues, though? Juror No. 3: Don't know unless you try! Ryunosuke: How about this print here? It should do the trick, I think. Present Photograph of Gina or Post-Shooting Photograph Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Alright then, juror number three... ...are you saying you can do this with any two suitable photographic prints? Juror No. 3: Of course I can! Ryunosuke: Very well then...I'd like you to demonstrate. Juror No. 3: I'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all! Present Post-Shooting Photograph or Photograph of Gina (whichever has not been presented yet) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Wait, sorry? What do you mean, one more print? Juror No. 3: Oh dear, oh dear... Don't you have these in the Far East? Don't you know how a stereoscope works? Iris: Runo! Ryunosuke: What? Iris: You need two photographs for a stereoscope, remember? You know, one for the left eye, and one for the right. Ryunosuke: Oh, oh yes. I remember now. But the print we have from the pawnbrokery is just a normal photograph. Juror No. 3: No no no. I think you'll find... ...that the clue is in the name. It's a stereoscope, not a monoscope! You always need two prints! Ryunosuke: (...Thanks for the friendly explanation.) Iris: Hmmm... Well, if we obtain another print at some point later in the trial... ...we can always show it to this young man then. Juror No. 3: Hahaha! Ryunosuke: (I think you'll find...that know-it-all expression is really starting to annoy me.) Judge: Let's get things back on track, shall we, Counsel? Leads back to summation examination Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Ugh...I was wrong. I can't actually think of anything we could use at all. Iris: What? Really? Oh dear, I think maybe I need to have a stereoscopic look at your brain sometime. Ryunosuke: (...What's that supposed to mean?) Leads back to summation examinationJuror No. 4: If I have left it in there, I should think there'll be repercussions by now...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um, what exactly have you been muttering about all this time, sir? You keep talking about having left something somewhere or something like that. Juror No. 4: Ah...so sorry. As you can probably tell, I'm a surgeon. Ryunosuke: A surgeon?! (That totally passed me by...) Juror No. 4: Of course, people conducting surgery in this country aren't considered to be doctors. Oh no! Even though me and my kind are at the forefront of medical science! The real brains in the field! Ryunosuke: So...what is it that you think you've left behind? Juror No. 4: Ah well, that's...a little embarrassing, to be honest. You see I was operating on someone yesterday. Standard thing - went in through the abdomen. But when I'd finished the procedure, I... Well, I couldn't find my scalpel anywhere. Ryunosuke: What?! (Did he...? Surely not!) Juror No. 4: Exactly! 'Surely not!' you say to yourself, don't you? Worrying, isn't it? That's what's been troubling me this whole time. Could I really have left my scalpel inside the fellow's belly? ...No, of course I couldn't! So...there you have it. Like I said, a little embarrassing, really. Ryunosuke: ...That's one way of putting it. The other is manslaughter. Juror No. 4: That's exactly my concern! And seeing as this case appears to be all but sewn up... ...I need to focus on trying to remember exactly what I've sewn up elsewhere! Now...I'm sure I made sure everything was back as it should be. Well, as sure as you can be without being sure. Ryunosuke: (...I'm sure you need to be more sure.)Juror No. 5: Mind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Sorry, 'radio transmission'? What do you mean? Juror No. 5: ...Are you from the Far East? Stop. Ryunosuke: Um, yes. From the Empire of Japan. Juror No. 5: All communication with Far Eastern nations used to take place by mail. Royal Mail steamers take more than a month to complete the journey. Iris: Ah, but now we have the electric telegram. So we can send messages using electrical signals. Thousands of miles of cables have been laid along the ocean beds, connecting the entire world. Ryunosuke: Thousands of miles of cable? ...On the ocean bed? (It makes my head hurt just thinking about it.) Juror No. 5: You are well informed, young lady. Iris: Hehe! Juror No. 5: But cables will soon become a thing of the past. Stop. Ryunosuke: ...And just when I was starting to catch up. Juror No. 5: Radio transmission is the future. Stop. Messages carried over airwaves to four corners of globe. Stop. Excitement growing! Stop. Atmosphere electric! Stop. Ryunosuke: Right... (...Try not to wear out your fingers.) Juror No. 5: Era of wireless telegraphy! Stop. Driving technological revolution! Stop. And people say inventions like the stereoscope are the height of technology! What utter piffle! I can't understand it. I really can't. They're just silly toys! Pursue Juror No. 3 Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Erm, juror number three...sorry to interrupt when you're obviously fuming, but... Juror No. 3: What?! Ryunosuke: Do you perhaps have something to say about juror number five's last remark? ...As if I couldn't guess. Juror No. 3: Oh, you bet I do! Say that again! Go on! I dare you! Juror No. 5: Goodness! Are you talking to me? Ryunosuke: ...I think he just might be, yes. Juror No. 3: You think stereoscopes are just toys, do you? Huh? Juror No. 5: Absolutely. I mean, really! A machine to view photographs in three dimensions? Why on earth would you not just use your eyes to look at the world around you? It's all three-dimensional! Ryunosuke: ...What a great way to appease the man. Juror No. 5: No, I'm sorry. Stereoscopes are of no practical use at all. Juror No. 3: ......... You just don't know! Juror No. 5: Pardon? Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that viewing a photograph through a stereoscope... ...can unlock all sorts of possibilities! I'm obviously going to have to demonstrate! Ryunosuke: What sort of possibilities? Juror No. 3: Well, take a crime scene, for example. If you had a pair of photographs from a crime scene that you could view through a stereoscope... ...it could reveal hidden clues you'd never even noticed before! Ryunosuke: What?! Iris: Have you got any, Runo? Any prints we could look at with a stereoscope? Absolutely! Ryunosuke: How about this print here? It should do the trick, I think. Present Photograph of Gina or Post-Shooting Photograph Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Alright then, juror number three... ...are you saying you can do this with any two suitable photographic prints? Juror No. 3: Of course I can! Ryunosuke: Very well then...I'd like you to demonstrate. Juror No. 3: I'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all!

You always need two prints! Ryunosuke: (...Thanks for the friendly explanation.) Iris: Hmmm... Well, if we obtain another print at some point later in the trial... ...we can always show it to this young man then. Juror No. 3: Hahaha! Ryunosuke: (I think you'll find...that know-it-all expression is really starting to annoy me.) Judge: Let's get things back on track, shall we, Counsel? Changes Juror No. 3's statement to \"All we'd need is another shot from a slightly different location, and we could see the scene in three dimensions!\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Ugh...I was wrong. I can't actually think of anything we could use at all. Iris: What? Really? Oh dear, I think maybe I need to have a stereoscopic look at your brain sometime. Ryunosuke: (...What's that supposed to mean?) Leads back to summation examination None spring to mind Ryunosuke: Ugh...no, I don't think so. None spring to mind, anyway. Iris: Well if you find any, we should definitely try it! Ryunosuke: ...I don't think we're just going to find prints of the crime scene lying around, you know. (But I suppose if we somehow find ourselves with some, it would be worth a go...) Leads back to summation examination Ryunosuke: ...Don't spare any feelings, will you? It's not like there's anyone here who likes stereoscopes... So...why exactly do you think that the defendant is guilty? Juror No. 5: It's quite simple... We haven't been shown a scrap of evidence to suggest that she isn't the culprit. And just as radio waves dash through the skies faster than the eye can see... ...so we should dash to the conclusion of this trial, and stop pandering to in-dit-cision!Juror No. 6: In motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Please tell me you're not Vilen Borshevik... ...the Russian revolutionary. Juror No. 5: Re-Revolutionary?! Juror No. 6: ......... Da. I believe there is such a rumour. Ryunosuke: ...It's just a rumour? Juror No. 6: As you see, I have unfortunate appearance. I look like wicious criminal. Ryunosuke: (...Your words, not mine. Just want to point that out.) Juror No. 6: People call me revolutionary...murderer...autocrat... Juror No. 5: And...which glove fits? Juror No. 6: 'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.' Juror No. 5: ......... Ryunosuke: (Right. That didn't sound staged at all. You'll forgive me for having my doubts.) Juror No. 6: To be treated like wicious criminal all the time... It is wery painful. People do not realise. So I have much sympathies for these brothers. People say they are criminals only because of how they look. Ryunosuke: The Skulkin brothers? Juror No. 6: Da, maybe they went inside pawnbroker's shop. But they have done nothing wrong. That is all what I want to say! Ryunosuke: ...The Skulkin brothers did nothing wrong that night? (Alright, well first of all... ...that's one not-so-little misunderstanding I'll need to clear up straight away.) Tell me something, Iris... Iris: Hm? What is it, Runo? Ryunosuke: The jurors are chosen at random from the inhabitants of London town, aren't they? Iris: Yes! It's amazing, isn't it? Ryunosuke: In that case... ...how is it that there's a Russian tourist sitting among them, who looks for all the world like a revolutionary? Iris: ...I wish I knew.Pit against Juror No. 2's statement (after Juror No. 2 changes her statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself! Juror No.2: Oh my! My statement? Contradictory? Juror No. 6: Contradict... C-o-n... Ryunosuke: Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick. Juror No. 6: ...I do not have stick. I have mouse. Ryunosuke: As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver. Juror No. 2: Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand! Ryunosuke: ...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d... Ryunosuke: ...Sir? Juror No. 6: Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning. Ryunosuke: ...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear? Juror No. 6: ......... Forgive me. I did not hear. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 6: ...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker. Ryunosuke: (...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!) Juror No. 6: So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative. Ryunosuke: Yes! That's exactly right! Juror No. 6: Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal! Ryunosuke: ...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced. Juror No. 6: This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?! Ryunosuke: Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so... Juror No. 6: Enough! I trust no one now! Ryunosuke: ...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir. Juror No. 6: I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself! Ryunosuke: I'm afraid that won't be poss- Iris: Yes it is, Runo! Easily! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder! Ryunosuke: Ah... Iris: If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor! Van Zieks: Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight. Iris: So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken. Ryunosuke: (That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.) Juror No. 6: So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing. Ryunosuke: It would seem so, yes. Juror No. 6: Good. Ryunosuke: No, not good. Juror No. 6: You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial. Iris: Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting! Ryunosuke: Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still! Judge: Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence. The post-shooting photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: (Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...) Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.\"Juror No. 6: In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.Ryunosuke: (If I can't change the minds of more than half of these six jurors... ...the trial will be over.)Iris: But we know that Ginny would never shoot anyone.Ryunosuke: Yes, so we need to find contradictions in what these jurors are saying and pit them against each other. (I must be ready to go to whatever lengths I have to... to convince them of Gina's innocence!)Ryunosuke: Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.Juror No. 3: Yes, I see. Tell me, Mr, um...lawyer. Do you know how stereographic images work? Do you understand the principle?Ryunosuke: Well...I think so... (I did have a lesson only yesterday...) The left and right eye images need to be the same, only with a slight shift in the positions of some objects. Then when your brain merges the two images together inside your head, it notices the shift as if it were depth.Juror No. 3: Yes, exactly.Iris: It's that small shift between certain objects in the two pictures that's really important.Ryunosuke: So what happens if you use two photographs that are exactly the same, then?Juror No. 3: No no, obviously that wouldn't work at all. Not for seeing the scene three-dimensionally, anyway.Iris: Oh... OOOOOOH! Of course! Now I see!Juror No. 3: Ah! I think the young girl has discovered the secret!Iris: I have, I have!Ryunosuke: ...Can you uncross your eyes before you tell me?Iris: Have another look at these two pictures from Hurley's camera, Runo! Go on! Can you see that there's a really obvious difference between them?Ryunosuke: Of course there is! There are two people in the first, and no people in the second!Iris: Well yes, you can see that straight away. But now... ...try looking at the pictures in three dimensions!Ryunosuke: Alright, I'll, I'll give it a go. (So, to start with... ...you have to cross your eyes, and then try to make the two pictures overlap exactly.) ........................... (Let's see if by crossing my eyes I can make the quill pens from each picture overlap in the middle...) ........................... (...Wait...)Iris: Well? Did you manage to see it properly, Runo?Not really... Ryunosuke: I'm just not very good at this, that's the trouble. Iris: Oh, don't worry. I have just the thing! I happened to bring with me...a portable stereoscope! Ryunosuke: ......... I know I mentioned this yesterday, but if you've had that contraption with you from the outset... ...you could have saved me staring at Mr Windibank and Gina like I hate them all that time! Iris: And if you remember, I said in reply... ...that it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Anyway, why don't we try using this helpful little aid now? Here goes... Ryunosuke: ........................... (Now, let's see what we've got... ...Wait! Look at that!)  Leads to: \"Agh!\"Yes, I saw it! Leads to: \"Agh!\"Ryunosuke: Agh! What's, what's going on with these two pictures? Some of the things on the counter sort of... They sort of jump out at you!Juror No. 3: Yes yes yes! That's it, you see! That's the other amazing power of stereoscopes!Ryunosuke: O-Other amazing power?!Juror No. 1: Is someone going to explain this...black magic, eh? Why the deuce do some of the things on the counter seem to jump out at you like that, hm?Juror No. 3: I think you'll find that if you consider the basic principle of the stereoscope, you'll answer your own question.Juror No. 5: Basic principles...of the stereoscope...?Juror No. 3: As I said before... ...if you try to look at two identical pictures using a stereoscope, it won't work at all. It's the slight shift in the positions of certain objects that lets you see pictures three-dimensionally.Ryunosuke: ...In other words... ...even though at first glance it seems the objects on the counter haven't moved at all between the two pictures... ...this shows that actually...there must have been a slight shift in their positions!Iris: Yes, there must have been.Juror No. 1: Now hold fire there, sir! Got a reasonable grasp of this whole cross-eyed business now, I'd say. But why the devil does this shift between the two prints exist in the first place? Well? What's the answer, fellow? Come on, you're the cross-eyed master!Ryunosuke: What? Me? (I haven't the first idea!)Iris: You know, Runo! It's quite simple.Ryunosuke: It, it is?Iris: Just think it through step by step. The first photograph was taken at 1:00 a.m. Then, thirty minutes later...the second photograph was taken. But the position of some items on the counter appears to have shifted slightly in the interim. So that means...?Ryunosuke: That means that sometime in the half hour interval... ...someone must have tampered with the things on the counter!Juror No. 1: Zookers!Juror No. 3: Someone tampered...?Juror No. 5: New information! Stop. Not mentioned in testimony so far! Stop.Ryunosuke: (Yes... ...we've had to go around in circles a little here, it seems... ...but I'm starting to see what I should be aiming at in this summation examination now.) Ladies and gentlemen! The question now is clear. We know the items on the countertop were moved. ...But by whom?Juror No. 1: Are you... Are you suggesting you might know?Ryunosuke: Of course. I can tell you right now who is responsible for the almost imperceptible shift in the items on the counter!Present Nash Skulkin or Ringo Skulkin profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Quite clearly it was the work...of this meddler! Judge: Hm... I'm afraid you've digressed there, Counsel. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: It should now be clear even to you... ...who is responsible for the impeachable shift in the direction of this trial...toward the absurd. Ryunosuke: Let me guess... ...Me? Van Zieks: Shift aside, my Nipponese friend, and let the real lawyers do the talking! Ryunosuke: Uargh! (I really felt that one...) Iris: If you think about it... ...it has to have been someone who was in Windibank's when everything was going on, doesn't it? Ryunosuke: Well...yes, that's true. Iris: So... ...that narrows it down quite a lot, I think. Ryunosuke: I'll have another think! (We know somebody must have touched the things on Mr Windibank's counter. So who was it?) Leads back to: \"Ladies and gentlemen!\"Ryunosuke: It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!Juror No. 2: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Juror No. 6: Wait! This does not agree with what brothers said in testimony before. They said they did not even have time to pull 'dukes' from 'Lucy Lockets'. My phrasebook says 'dukes' is meaning 'hands' and 'Lucy Lockets' is meaning 'pockets'. But is this...another lie?! Is this what you are saying?!Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm afraid so.Juror No. 4: Now hold on there a minute! You can't be sure of that.Juror No. 2: I quite agree. The accused is a common pickpurse, after all. It's perfectly possible that she went through the things on the desk to see what she might steal.Ryunosuke: I think...that's unlikely.Juror No. 1: And why, exactly?Ryunosuke: ...As you can see from...this photographic print, the defendant was pointing a gun at the victim. It would seem, as my learned friend indicated, that she was coercing Mr Windibank to open the storeroom door. In other words, Miss Lestrade's interests lay within the storeroom, not in the main shop... ...giving her no reason to touch anything on the counter. All of which points to one thing! The Skulkin brothers have omitted key facts in their testimony!Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...! But the accused is a pickpurse! Common gutter trash! Why look any further for the wrongdoer here?Ryunosuke: Because the Skulkin brothers are thieves, madam. No better - in fact worse - than a pickpurse.Juror No. 2: ...!Ryunosuke: I believe that these brothers were looking for something on the victim's counter that night.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Ryunosuke: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you would condemn the defendant on the grounds that she's a pickpocket... ...would it not at least be right and proper to thoroughly scrutinise testimony given against her by two thieves?Juror No. 4: ...Well said.Ryunosuke: ...!Juror No. 4: I for one would like to hear more from that shady pair!Juror No. 3: Can you all see now? I think you'll find stereoscopes aren't playthings! You've seen their extraordinary potential firsthand!Juror No. 5: Wholeheartedly agree! Stop. Must purchase after trial. Stop. Will return home via Regent Street. Stop.Judge: Well...it would seem this trial has yet to run its course. The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have declared their inclinations via the mighty Scales of Justice. I hereby call this summation examination to conclusion with the balance altered in the defendant's favour. Two lean to guilty. Four lean to not guilty. Accordingly, the jury is without consensus... ...and I order this trial to continue.Iris: Yay! Well done! ...Oh, by the way...Ryunosuke: What?Iris: You should hold onto this, Runo. You never know when it might come in useful!Ryunosuke: (Twice in one trial would be unusual, surely? But alright.)The stereoscope has been entered into the Court Record.Judge: Lord van Zieks... ...you will instruct the witnesses that the court demands additional testimony from them.Examine evidence Stereoscope Print tray Iris: You have to pop your two prints in here to start with, you see. Ryunosuke: And then, when you look through the eyepieces, you can see the image in three dimensions! Iris: The important thing to get right is the position of the two prints. Ryunosuke: (I don't know who came up with the idea of a stereoscope, but it's really quite fascinating.) Button Ryunosuke: Ooh! Look at that! It's totally changed shape, just from one little button press! Iris: Well, that is what the button's for, Runo. You're just like Hurley. You boys love pressing buttons, don't you, especially if you don't know what they do! Ryunosuke: (Us boys? ...Says the ten-year-old girl.) Iris: Anyway, now you can see that it really is a stereoscope, can't you?Van Zieks: ......... I'm sure it won't spoil the bouquet to do so...My Lord.Ryunosuke: (I've won myself another chance to probe that pair about their activities that night at least. And I won't stop probing them until I've proven that Gina is innocent!)To be continued...Judge: Order, please. Let us resume proceedings. Witnesses! You will now retake the stand.Judge: I presume you heard the defence counsel's summation examination?Nash: Oh...yeah...guvnor.Ringo: I did, guv, I did.Ryunosuke: ...Mr and Mr Skulkin!Cor!Blimey!Ryunosuke: (...This is going to be hard work.) Earlier in this trial, you gave the following testimony about your actions after you entered Windibank's...Nash: Well it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?Ringo: It woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke: However...that was a lie! You brothers!Cor!Blimey!Ryunosuke: On the night in question... ...you rifled through the items on the victim's counter!We never done nuffin' o' the sort!'Ow d'you figure that out?.........Judge: You will now give formal testimony once again. You will tell the court precisely what happened on the night in question. And this time...you will tell the truth.Van Zieks: ...Each lie that passes your lips serves to increase the severity of your punishment. And that, gentlemen, may deal a crushing blow to your chances of ever seeing the light of day again....!...!Van Zieks: A thought worth pondering perhaps.Say no more, guv! We 'ear ya!We'll blab! We'll speak! We'll peach!Witness Testimony - Illegal Entry: The Whole Truth -Nash: Alright, we did knock a few things over. But we weren't riflin' fer nuffin'!Ringo: It woz when we 'eard the gunshot, see. Made us both jump, an' all that stuff went flyin'.Nash: Lummy, it didn't 'alf gimme a fright! We woz thinkin' the shooter'd come out the door and get us next.Ringo: We stuck everyfin' back where we found it and scarpered...straight into 'im in the black.Nash: We couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?Judge: Hmmm...so you admit to the defence's accusation. You did indeed ransack Mr Windibank's countertop on the night in question.Nash: Err...not ransack, guvnor, no.Ringo: That's right, Nash, that's right. It's...more like we tidied up. Yeah.Van Zieks: .........Ringo: Ugh...sorry.Van Zieks: By their own admission, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery under dubious circumstances. However, they panicked and fled on hearing the gunshot, having first made good their mess.Nash: The way you say it...we 'ardly sound like roughs at all.Ringo: We don't, Nash, we don't. Can't 'e make us sound a bit more...cut-throat?Ryunosuke: (It can't just be coincidence that these men showed up at Windibank's that night. There's more to their testimony than meets the eye. I'm sure of it!)Cross-Examination - Illegal Entry: The Whole Truth -Ringo: Alright, so we'd just got inside the gaff and 'eaved a sigh o' relief when the geezer showed 'is mug!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say 'geezer', I presume you mean the victim and proprietor of the shop, Mr Windibank? Ringo: Who else- ...Sorry, I mean, that's right! Nash: We woz keepin' a close eye on the entrance to the gaff, obviously. But we never thought no one woz gonna come outta the back room like that! Ryunosuke: The back room being the pawnbrokery's storeroom? Ringo: Yeah, that must be where 'e popped up from. Only place 'e could've been. Van Zieks: So it would seem the victim was already in the storeroom when these brothers entered the premises. Iris: Which means...Ginny must have been in there at that point as well. Ryunosuke: But that doesn't make sense...does it? If Gina had threatened Mr Windibank into the storeroom with her at gunpoint... ...then why would he have emerged from the same room all alone when the brothers arrived? Iris: Oh, I...don't know... Ryunosuke: Did you see the accused at that time? Ringo: Wot, that moll-tooler? Couldn't tell ya! Nash: No way, cobber! We 'ad bigger fish to fry then! I mean the old geezer just lost it!Nash: 'Gimme that gun!' 'e bellowed, and then 'e flew at us like 'e woz possessed! I thought we'd 'ad it!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You mentioned that Mr Windibank shouted those words in your previous testimony, too. However, you claimed that you heard him yelling them on the other side of the storeroom door. Nash: Oh...um... Hehe. ...Did we? Ryunosuke: But the truth is, he he was shouting those words at you, wasn't he? Nash: Erm...well... Hehe. ...Yeah. Van Zieks: Was the victim - Mr Windibank - wielding a gun at the time? Ringo: Woz 'e ever! Blimey lummy! A great ugly barrel 'e 'ad, pointed straight at me frontispiece! Ryunosuke: So what you're saying is... ...you definitely saw Mr Windibank with the gun at that time. Is that right? Ringo: It is, guv, it is. Spot on. Nash: Then all of a sudden 'e came at us, 'e did! Ringo: It woz bedlam! I didn't know who woz goin' for who! Ryunosuke: ...You were clearly all going for each other. Ringo: Like Nash said, we thought we'd 'ad it. I mean...Ringo: For an old geezer, the bloke woz strong as an ox. 'E chucked me over the counter!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Yes, I noted that you mentioned the counter in your previous testimony, too. Ringo: Well...yeah...'course we did! Nash: 'E knocked over a load o' books, a candlestick and some skull wotnot. Ringo: That got tangled in some marionette, wot knocked over a picture frame, wot knocked them scales on the floor. Ryunosuke: So in fact, it wasn't the sound of the gunshot that shocked you and made you knock those things off the counter? Nash: Well...'big' bruv 'ere went flyin' over that counter like a gunshot, I can tell ya! Then the old geezer pinned 'im! Ringo: 'E did, Nash, 'e did! If you 'adn't been there, the bloke would've flattened me like a bloomin' pancake in seconds! Van Zieks: At the time in question, the alarm was raised at the local police station via a secret cable from the pawnbrokery. There is a button under the counter used to activate it, which was presumably pressed by the victim. Ryunosuke: (That's right... When the brothers fled the scene and back onto the street... ...they ran straight into the arriving police, didn't they?) Iris: Poor Mr Windibank... He did everything he could to protect his shop...Nash: I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Were you intending to shoot Mr Windibank? Nash: Nah nah nah nah! Never! I, I woz just...ya know... Lookin' out fer me bruv, weren't I? 'E woz bein' flattened, don't forget! Ryunosuke: ...By a man whose shop was being burgled, yes. Van Zieks: And then? The man fled into the storeroom when you pointed your gun at him, is that it? Nash: Yeah, that's it. 'E shoved me away, then ran off fru that door an' shut 'imself in! Ryunosuke: ......... (There's something about that last remark... Something that doesn't quite ring true.) Iris: Hm...I wonder why Mr Windibank ran away into the storeroom... Ryunosuke: What? Iris: Well, according to what everyone's saying... ...Ginny was in there waiting for him...with a gun. Ryunosuke: Ah... (Yes, that's right.) Gina allegedly used Mr Windibank's gun to threaten him and force him to open the storeroom door. In which case...how did the gun end up in Mr Windibank's hands again? Iris: I have no idea... But that is strange, isn't it? Ryunosuke: (This little inconsistency could be significant. I should make a mental note of it.) Nash: Look, the point is, me an' me bruv 'ere... Ringo: That's right, Nash, that's right! Me an' me bruv 'ere...Ringo: We never 'ad nuffin' to do wiv killin' 'im! That's all wot 'appened, I swear!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You say you had nothing to do with it? Nash: Nuffin' at all! Ringo: Nuffin', guv, nuffin'! The old geezer went and shut 'imself in the back room, didn't 'e? Nash: Locked, it woz. From the inside. Ringo: We know it woz, cos we tried to open it. Nash: But it's a decent door, that one. Good an' strong. Wouldn't budge an inch! Van Zieks: So in the end, the situation remains unchanged. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Inside the storeroom with the pawnbroker there was only one other person. The sole person  who could possibly have shot the victim: the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade! Ryunosuke: Agh! Judge: Hm... It would indeed appear so. What say you to that, Counsel? Ryunosuke: (I don't know...) Was there anyone else apart from Gina who could possibly have shot Mr Windibank? There's no one else Ryunosuke: (He's right. Gina's the only one. There was no one else in the room!) Iris: With an attitude like that, Runo, it really will be all over. Ryunosuke: (Now a ten-year-old is reading the expression on my face...) Iris: Well, you just don't have that many. Wide-eyed, sweating, smug and happy. That's about it! Ryunosuke: (Surely there's more than that... isn't there?) Iris: Aaanyway...I think you might want to consider some other possibilities here. ...Or rather, I think you have to. Otherwise we won't get anywhere. ...Or rather, YOU won't get anywhere. I'm just here for moral support, remember. Leads back to cross-examination There could have been! Ryunosuke: Mr and Mr Skulkin! Nash: Eh?! Wot? Ringo: Wot's that look for? Ryunosuke: From the moment you admitted that you'd encountered the victim face to face that night... ...the course of this trial changed completely. Nash: It did? Van Zieks: What is your point...my learned friend? Ryunosuke: The question we must answer is who could have shot Mr Windibank. And it is the belief of the defence that the defendant is not the only possible answer at all. Van Zieks: You have my attention. In that case...let us return to this plan of the premises. The victim was killed in the storeroom, which was locked from the inside. Those are the facts. So pray...what other possible answer to the question of who shot the man could there be? Judge: Counsel... ...you must now provide answers to the court in respect of two conundrums. Ryunosuke: Two...My Lord? (...Twice as many chances to be right, maybe?) Judge: Indeed. Namely... ...from what location did the culprit shoot the victim? And furthermore... ...where was the victim at the time? Ryunosuke: ......... Understood, My Lord. Iris: Are you alright, Runo? Ryunosuke: I'm not entirely sure. But there's one thing I am sure about. If I can prove that there's a credible new alternative to what happened... ...it would change Gina's prospects hugely! Van Zieks: So now...time for some clarity. Show the court on this plan the answers to the questions posed by His Lordship. If you believe someone else could have killed the victim, indicate from where that person could have fired the gun! Present anywhere Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence believes that the culprit could have shot the victim from this location here. Van Zieks: ......... And in answer to the second question... Assuming the culprit fired from the location indicated, where was the victim at the time? Present storeroom (after presenting main shop) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The culprit shot the victim from outside the storeroom!\" Present storeroom (after presenting storeroom) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence believes that the victim would have been in this position here. Van Zieks: Van Zieks: What your answers in fact show... ...is that your own position is as absurd as those you have indicated on the plan. Ryunosuke: What are you saying? Judge: What Lord van Zieks is saying, Counsel... ...is that your answers are clearly flawed! Ryunosuke: UWAAAAAAGH! (...I knew it. It's twice as many chances to be wrong.) Iris: So the questions are: from where did the culprit shoot the victim, and where was the victim at the time? Well... ...you have to at least choose a place that's outside the storeroom, don't you? Ryunosuke: Oh... Iris: I mean, if you're saying that someone shot Mr Windibank from inside the storeroom, they'll just say it was Ginny. Ryunosuke: ......... You're right. (What's the best move here? Should I try again, or gather more information first?) Give it a try Ryunosuke: The defence would like to point out the locations again! Van Zieks: Well well, you appear to be a glutton for punishment. Leads back to: \"So now...time for some clarity.\" Leave it Ryunosuke: My Lord, I would like to consider the situation a little more before giving my answers again. Van Zieks: Consider the situation as much as you like. The answers do not exist. Judge: Very well. The court will hear from the witnesses again while you deliberate, Counsel. Leads back to cross-examination Otherwise Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The defence believes that the victim would have been in this position here. Van Zieks: Van Zieks: What your answers in fact show... ...is that your own position is as absurd as those you have indicated on the plan. Ryunosuke: What are you saying? Judge: What Lord van Zieks is saying, Counsel... ...is that your answers are clearly flawed! Ryunosuke: UWAAAAAAGH! (...I knew it. It's twice as many chances to be wrong.) Iris: So the questions are: from where did the culprit shoot the victim, and where was the victim at the time? Well... ...I don't see why we can't show that someone other than Ginny could have done it in the storeroom, do you? Ryunosuke: Yes, that's the right way of looking at it, I suppose. Someone other than Gina in the storeroom... (What's the best move here? Should I try again, or gather more information first?) Give it a try Ryunosuke: The defence would like to point out the locations again! Van Zieks: Well well, you appear to be a glutton for punishment. Leads back to: \"So now...time for some clarity.\" Leave it Ryunosuke: My Lord, I would like to consider the situation a little more before giving my answers again. Van Zieks: Consider the situation as much as you like. The answers do not exist. Judge: Very well. The court will hear from the witnesses again while you deliberate, Counsel. Leads back to cross-examinationRyunosuke: (So that's all these brothers are willing to reveal this time, is it?)Iris: They're still hiding something, don't you think?Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm sure of it. And not just a minor detail, either.Iris: It was almost certainly because of these two that poor Mr Windibank...well... You can't let them get away with it, Runo!Ryunosuke: I know. (But I get the feeling... ...that there's even less evidence at my disposal this time to prove that they did it.)Iris: We've come so far... Now it's time to finish them off!Ryunosuke: Well, I'll do my best.Ryunosuke: The culprit shot the victim from outside the storeroom!Van Zieks: ......... Continue.Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank died instantly from a bullet wound in his back. Looking at the stain of blood on the storeroom floor, it doesn't appear that the body was moved after death. Which tells us that he was almost certainly shot while he was in the storeroom. However, the crucial point is, where was the shooter when the fatal bullet was fired?Judge: So you are adamant...that the shot was fired from outside the storeroom?Ryunosuke: Well, according to the Skulkin brothers' earlier testimony...Nash: I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!Ryunosuke: If Mr Windibank ran away through the door... ...we have to assume that the door was open at the time.Judge: Ah!Ryunosuke: It was at precisely that moment, when the victim was fleeing for his life... ...that these brothers had the perfect opportunity to shoot the man in the back once he was inside the storeroom!NAAAAAAAAAGH!GAAAAAAAAAGH!Van Zieks: ...!Iris: Come to think of it...do you remember what the prosecutor said at the start of the trial?Van Zieks: Moving on to the findings of Scotland Yard's coroner... His report states that the bullet entered the body on a rising diagonal trajectory.Van Zieks: It means...the victim was likely shot by someone significantly shorter in height than himself.Iris: Poor man... Shot while he was running as fast as he could to safety...Ryunosuke: Ah! Of course! He would have been leaning forward as he was running away. So even if the bullet was fired horizontally, it would still have entered his body on an upward trajectory!Iris: So the culprit isn't necessarily someone shorter than Mr Windibank!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: I'm sure my learned friend can't have forgotten... ...that the storeroom door was found closed, and...locked from the inside. You claim the victim was shot as he fled into the room. Do you also claim his corpse was dexterous enough to turn the key in the lock?Ryunosuke: Agh! But...but... ...what if someone else locked the door? Yes! There is someone else who could have locked the storeroom door!Van Zieks: Is that so?Judge: Very well then, Counsel. Present your hypothesis to the court. In the scenario just described... ...the defence's assertion is that the victim was shot from outside the storeroom. In which case, who shut and locked the storeroom door from the inside?Present Gina Lestrade profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Obviously, the person who locked the door was the only other person inside the storeroom at the time...\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Obviously, that person could only have been... Iris: Just a moment, Runo! Ryunosuke: Hm? What? I'm just about to point dramatically at the prosecution and unveil an amazing revelation! Iris: Sorry, but just before you do, maybe you should take a deep breath and think things through one more time? The storeroom was locked from the inside. So whoever locked it must have been inside, too...don't you think? Ryunosuke: Ah, like Mr Windibank, you mean? Iris: Well yes, except that he was dead. But there's someone else it could have been. Only one other person, really. Ryunosuke: Oh... (Only one other?) Judge: You're out of time, I'm afraid. ...For which you must be penalised. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (There's a time limit?) Judge: Now then, let me pose the question again. Leads back to: \"In the scenario just described...\"Ryunosuke: Obviously, the person who locked the door was the only other person inside the storeroom at the time... ...the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: That's absurd! You're suggesting that the accused deliberately engineered the sealed room? For what possible reason?! Such actions would only serve to tighten the noose around her neck!Judge: I am inclined to agree, I must say. ...Well, Counsel?Ryunosuke: ......... Ah...yes...that's a tricky one, that...isn't it?Judge: Half-baked notions have no place in my courtroom, Counsel. Remember that, please.Iris: But of course Ginny would have locked the door. It almost goes without saying, doesn't it?Ryunosuke: It, it does?Iris: Well if I was Ginny in that situation... ...I know I would have locked the door. As quickly as I could! I mean... ...those two burglars had just fired a gun in her direction, hadn't they?Ryunosuke: (Oh yes! Obviously...) Before the two brothers arrived, Miss Lestrade and Mr Windibank were in the storeroom together. Now...I don't know what went on between them at that time, but at some point... ...Mr Windibank must have heard the intruders breaking into his shop, and left the storeroom.Ringo: Intruders, eh? ...That's us, bruv!Van Zieks: If your theory is correct, that would leave the accused alone in the storeroom.Ryunosuke: ...Yes, it would. Then, probably only moments later, the victim fled back through the storeroom door hoping to escape danger.*BANG!*Ryunosuke: Hit in the back by the bullet, Mr Windibank fell to the floor where he was, just inside the storeroom. And what we have to ask ourselves now is, what would the defendant have done in that moment?Nash: Ah! I, I see where yer goin' wiv this!Ryunosuke: Outside the storeroom was a terrifying killer who had just murdered Mr Windibank. As soon as that thought struck Miss Lestrade, she slammed the door shut and locked it... ...in order to save her own life!Van Zieks: ...!Judge: ...!???:Nash: But, but I ain't- I mean, we ain't the ones who dunnit!Ringo: We ain't, guv, we ain't! You've gotta believe us! I mean, come on! We'd never shoot no one!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: That's blatantly untrue! I know for a fact that you would. Because before my own eyes...you shot Mr Herlock Sholmes!Ringo: ...!Nash: ...!Ryunosuke: There is only one logical conclusion here. Mr and Mr Skulkin, you brothers had every opportunity... ...to have been the true perpetrators of Mr Windibank's murder!Nash: Ah...em...um...Ringo: Erm...em...ugh...NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!Where, where does this leave us? You mean to say it wasn't the pickpocket who shot the pawnbroker after all? I should have known it was those three brothers! They look as shady as a dense forest!Iris: That was amazing, Runo! All the members of the jury seem to be firmly on your side now!Ryunosuke: I know! First time ever! And probably the last...Iris: Well, I think you've done it! Surely they'll have to give a verdict of not-Van Zieks: ...Keh...heh...heh... An admirable effort...my learned friend.Ryunosuke: ...! (What's this now? He's laughing?)Judge: You find the situation amusing, Lord van Zieks? I myself find the defence's argument most persuasive.Van Zieks: I dare say... ...such chicanery is the bread and butter of the street performers in your provincial Eastern nation. But such blatantly malicious conjuring tricks amount to nothing more than inexcusable pettifoggery here.Ryunosuke: What?!Van Zieks: The hypothesis you put forward so ostensibly credibly cannot, and will not stand. Because, you see, it contains a fatal flaw!Ryunosuke: A, a fatal flaw?!Van Zieks: ...Do you mean to tell me that you're unaware of your logic's failing?Juror No. 1: I say! Lord van Zieks... Might be an idea to explain this bally conjuring trick or whatever it is to the troops on the ground, hm?Van Zieks: The fatal flaw in my learned friend's argument is really very simple to understand... ...assuming you're not too dim-witted to count bullets!Juror No. 1: By George! Count bullets?!Iris: Oh dear... ...he noticed then.Ryunosuke: Huh? (What's everyone talking about?)Van Zieks: Counsel!Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, sir?!Van Zieks: Tell the court, how many bullets were found at the scene of the crime?Ryunosuke: Um...two. Two bullets.Van Zieks: Correct. The first, that which hit the victim in the back, ending his life. And the second, that which struck the 'detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes, on his arrival at the scene.Judge: Indeed. The defence presented a picture showing the damage caused by the second bullet earlier in the proceedings. The bullet which injured Mr Sholmes appears to have passed through his body to strike the calendar.Van Zieks: Your Lordship's understanding is correct. Furthermore, we know there are two firearms involved in the incident. The revolver belonging to the victim, Mr Windibank... ...and the Skulkin brothers' revolver. The evidence shows that a single bullet was fired from each gun.Judge: Yes! Indeed it does! A single bullet from each!Van Zieks: Now then, my learned friend...Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: You yourself told the court only moments ago... ...that these two brothers shot Mr Herlock Sholmes right before your eyes.Ryunosuke: Yes, I, I did!Juror No. 3: Oh my goodness! I, I think you'll find...Juror No. 4: That if the single bullet that was fired from the brothers' gun hit Mr Sholmes, it means...Juror No. 5: Windibank not shot by same gun! Stop. Only one bullet! Stop.Van Zieks: ...Exactly. Yes, this Nipponese street performer presented an ostensibly credible argument. ...However! It was never anything more than a diversionary trick with no hope of standing up to scrutiny!Ryunosuke: Ugh............ UWAAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!Van Zieks: ...Pray forgive the discourtesy of flinging the dregs of this hallowed nectar into the public gallery...Judge: L-Lord van Zieks!Van Zieks: ...but this court needs to open its eyes. The accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, is no ordinary little girl. Despite her young years, she can, regrettably, no longer be described as a juvenile. No, the person in the dock is far from a law-abiding citizen. She has a past riddled with criminal conduct!Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Van Zieks: The truth is, the accused broke into the pawnbrokery on the night in question with loathsome intent... ...as we can see beyond doubt in this print which depicts her threatening the victim with the murder weapon!Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Van Zieks: And I have here in my possession one more piece of evidence the prosecution wishes to present.Ryunosuke: ...! (That disk!)Gregson: I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much!Gina: No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!Gregson: I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.Ryunosuke: (Yes, that music box disk... McGilded's music box disk...)Van Zieks: The very day before the hateful murder of Mr Windibank... ...the accused attempted to make off with this article, which clearly doesn't belong to her. And with none of the subtlety of a pickpocket, I might add. But by brute force and brazen impudence.Judge: Good gracious!Van Zieks: Make no mistake! Any sympathy for the accused on account of her years is misguided and dangerous! There are no depths to which this girl would not stoop if pushed. No crime she would not commit. ...The court forgets that fact at its peril.Juror No. 5: ...!Juror No. 6: ...!Judge: Hm...I see... I think it would be prudent to take this music box disk into evidence, Counsel. As a grim testament to the defendant's character.???:Gregson: Um...Lord van Zieks...I, um...Ryunosuke: (Inspector Gregson...what...?)Van Zieks: Yes, Inspector?Gregson: We had a meetin' yesterday at the Yard with the prosecution service, and, um... ...I, I think it was agreed that that disk wouldn't be used as evidence.Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: (What's this all about? Why is the inspector acting strangely? That's the first time he's said anything to van Zieks at all...)Van Zieks: I am unaware of any such meeting.Gregson: But! But those were the instructions, right from the top. The government bigwigs were insistent!Van Zieks: Inspector, I am the prosecutor, and I alone determine how to present my case. Your warning is noted. ...Thank you.Gregson: ...!Van Zieks: The prosecution wishes to proceed with submitting this disk as evidence, My Lord.Judge: In-Indeed. Bailiff!The music box disk has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: The prosecution has established the accused's motive, opportunity and baseness of character. There is nothing more to add. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I await your informed decisions...and rest my case.Examine evidence Music Box Disk Bloodstain Iris: Oh! Runo, look! This is blood! Ryunosuke: Yes, you're right. (Just a small smear, but definitely blood. Actually, I feel as though I might have noticed that before...) Iris: Haha! Then it's my time to shine again! I thought I'd be waiting forever! Alright, hold still with that disk, Runo. Ryunosuke: Can we get this done quickly, Iris? Iris: In a flash! Ooh! A lovely bright shade again. Ryunosuke: ......... (Wait, that colour...) Iris: What is it? Ryunosuke: It's just...that green, it... ...it's not the first time we've seen that colour, is it? The blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record. Bloodstain (subsequent times) Iris: So this is blood! Probably from somebody's fingertip. Ryunosuke: Well deduced. But not just somebody's fingertip... Mr Benedict's fingertip. Iris: The man dressed all in white? Ryunosuke: Yes. It happened that afternoon in Windibank's. Gina tried to snatch this disk out of the man's hands, and the sharp little bumps cut his thumb. Iris: So the lesson is, if someone tries to grab a music box disk from you, let go quickly. Ryunosuke: ...The lesson is don't snatch things, surely? Note on back Iris: 'For McGilded'... That's the man you defended in court a couple of months ago, isn't it, Runo? Ryunosuke: Yes. Or rather, mistakenly defended. Iris: I wonder what his name is doing on the back of this disk... Ryunosuke: That's a question I'd love to know the answer to myself.Ryunosuke: (I don't believe it... I had the jury on my side for once, for all of five minutes...)Iris: Oh dear... It wasn't even for five minutes, Runo...???:My Lord!Juror No. 1: Wonder if I might say something at this point?Judge: Proceed, Mr Foreman.Juror No. 1: Been stumbling about in a bit of a fog up to now, if truth be told. But all of a sudden... ...the answer's bally obvious to me and my men! There's only one thing for it!Ryunosuke: (Oh no!)Judge: Very well. The court will hear from the jury. Ladies and gentlemen, you will present your leanings as to the defendant's culpability.Juror No. 1: Guilty!Juror No. 2: Guilty!Juror No. 3: Guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Guilty!Judge: We have a consensus among the jury, it seems.Van Zieks: When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains...must be the truth.Iris: That's, that's my line! I wrote that! For Hurley! Argh! How dare he use it against us?!Ryunosuke: Don't worry, Iris. I don't think we're finished yet. (There's still more to this case than we realise. There must be, because there's one thing that I'm absolutely certain of. Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank! That's beyond any doubt!)Judge: Very well... ...we will proceed with the second summation examination of the day. Mr Foreman, are you and the other jurors ready?Juror No. 1: Garrideb Squadron is primed and ready for action, sir!Judge: Very good. So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have now determined the defendant to be guilty!Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1: Once a rogue always a rogue, I say...hm? Different breed to us law-abiding citizens!Juror No. 2: As only two bullets were found at the scene, I would say the whole case is done and dusted.Juror No. 3: You don't need a stereoscope to see the truth here. Every which way you look at it, it was that pickpocket!Juror No. 4: Hm...I never imagined that simple operation would cause me such grief...Juror No. 5: The accused attempted a theft on the previous day. ...I can see I'm in for a busy day ahead.Juror No. 6: I am ballistics expert. I have seen many shootings. There is nothing I do not know about guns.Judge: Hmmm... It would seem there is little remaining room for doubt.Juror No. 1: Have to admit, I was rather bowled over by the argument put forward by the chap in black. But when that fell apart like a house of cards, I saw that I'd jolly well been hoodwinked. Well, no more!Ryunosuke: (Ugh...the whole courtroom is turning against me.)Iris: It's not fair!Ryunosuke: Iris?Iris: That prosecutor's being mean! Just because Ginny's done some things she shouldn't have done in the past... ...that doesn't make her a murderer!Van Zieks: Allow me to savour this fruity vintage while I savour the spectacle of your fruitless debate on the matter. Here's to the truth coming out...eventually.Ryunosuke: .........Judge: That's enough preamble. Counsel, proceed with the summation examination.Ryunosuke: ...Yes, My Lord.Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1: Once a rogue always a rogue, I say...hm? Different breed to us law-abiding citizens!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Just because Miss Lestrade has a history of pickpocketing, she must be guilty of murder, is that what you're saying? Juror No. 1: Ah...well... Ryunosuke: Are all members of the British army so quick to judge? Juror No. 1: I beg your pardon? Are you mocking Her Majesty's armed forces? The greatest military organisation in the world! Ryunosuke: No. I'm simply illustrating my point. Juror No. 1: ...! Ryunosuke: Making assumptions about people because they're a soldier...or a pickpocket...is wrong, and dangerous. Juror No. 1: Hmph. Well, yes, might have a point there, I suppose. But let's not forget the girl had already shown she had it in her from before. She's clearly a criminal sort through and through. Can't deny it. Ryunosuke: When you say that she'd 'shown she had it in her'...are you referring to this? Juror No. 1: Exactly. Tried to swipe that only a day earlier, hm? Or am I mistaken? Ryunosuke: ...Not exactly. (Given that I was actually there at the time, it's hard to refute that.) Iris: I've never actually seen the real thing. I can't wait to have a closer look at it! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, of course... Mr Sholmes did use his caramel bars to make a copy of the disk, didn't he. (And then ordered every type of music box he could find from across Europe...) Iris: We still don't know what tune it plays though, do we? But I'd love to see how the original compares to Hurley's copy. Ryunosuke: (McGilded's disk... Could it be a clue somehow? Perhaps we should examine it in more detail...)Juror No. 2: As only two bullets were found at the scene, I would say the whole case is done and dusted.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It's the number of bullets that has you convinced? Juror No. 2: Only two bullets were fired, and the two guns that fired them have been examined by the police. When the parlour maid asks me how many are invited for dinner, I always tell her to count the table settings. Ryunosuke: (Well, that's logical, I suppose.) Juror No. 2: Although... Ryunosuke: Yes? Juror No. 2: ...sometimes after dining, crockery does go missing. One or two guests rather like the fine china. Ryunosuke: ...Does your employer dine with thieves? Juror No. 2: So I suppose... ...if there was another bullet somewhere of which we were unaware... ...I'd have to reconsider my position. Ryunosuke: (...A third bullet somewhere on the scene? Could that be possible?) It's impossible Ryunosuke: Unfortunately... ...only two bullets were discovered by the police during their investigation. Juror No. 2: Yes, I know. Ryunosuke: Right... Juror No. 2: And I don't imagine the good men of Scotland Yard would have overlooked anything. If I missed a bullet while I was cleaning His Lordship's office, well! I should receive a sound scolding, I don't doubt. Ryunosuke: ...And he should receive a visit from the police, perhaps. It sounds like a crime scene to me. Iris: Hm, a third bullet.... Ryunosuke: It would completely turn things around if there was one, wouldn't it? Iris: ...Do you think we might find one lying around somewhere? Leads back to cross-examination I can prove it! Ryunosuke: Allow me to show you, then...the third bullet! Present The Third Bullet Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Here it is.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I, um...don't suppose this would pass as the third bullet? Van Zieks: It passes for a bullet as much as you pass for a lawyer... my learned friend. Ryunosuke: (Coming from you, I'm going to take that as meaning, 'not much'.) Van Zieks: In no way does it resemble a bullet...if that helps your understanding of my last remark. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Judge: Counsel, at the very least I would expect the evidence you present to be of the correct form! Ryunosuke: (...It's been a long day.) Iris: Let's actually try to find this third bullet before we attempt that again, Runo. Leads back to cross-examinationJuror No. 3: You don't need a stereoscope to see the truth here. Every which way you look at it, it was that pickpocket!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So if I've understood correctly, you need two pictures: a left eye one and a slightly different right eye one. Juror No. 3: Eeexactly! Then you can see the scene in three dimensions ...like this! Ryunosuke: So...if we have two bullets...I don't suppose you can see anything useful with them? Juror No. 3: Hm, I think you'll find... ...that no matter how much you squint, the truth of the situation always looks the same here. The only person who could have shot the victim is that girl in the dock! Ryunosuke: How can you be so sure of that? Juror No. 3: Think about it! The Skulkin brothers shot the great detective, didn't they? Ryunosuke: Yes...that's been mentioned once or twice... Juror No. 3: Well then! Surely it's coming into focus now, isn't it? Ryunosuke: (This is a waste of time. I'm not going to change this man's mind any time soon.)Juror No. 4: Hm...I never imagined that simple operation would cause me such grief...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Would you please stop muttering about things that have nothing to do with this trial, sir? The defendant's life is on the line here! Juror No. 4: Hm, well, the thing is... ...I couldn't really say that it is nothing to do with this trial, to be honest. Ryunosuke: Huh? Juror No. 4: I mean, there's no question that the man was shot, but the bullet had simply vanished from his stomach. It's quite inexplicable. ...Don't you think? Ryunosuke: ......... I almost don't want to ask, but this surgery you've been muttering about all this time. You were operating on... Juror No. 4: What was the fellow's name now? Herr Lich? ...No. Herr Loch? ...No. Hairlock? Ryunosuke: Herlock Sholmes by any chance? Juror No. 4: Yes! Good Lord! It was that Hairlock fellow! Ryunosuke: WHAAAT?! You're, you're the surgeon that operated on Mr Sholmes?! Juror No. 4: That's right. Using the very latest anaesthesia techniques, I might add! It was a fairly major op, I can tell you. Ryunosuke: (This is crazy!) Juror No. 4: Let me see, the fellow was brought in not long after midnight, if I remember correctly. They said he'd been shot by some criminal or other. So I opened him up like a shot. But the funny thing is, I went over his insides with a fine-tooth comb, and couldn't find the bullet anywhere. So I'm afraid I had to throw up my hands and just stitch the fellow back up. Ryunosuke: ......... I hate to state the obvious, but... Juror No. 4: Yes? Ryunosuke: ...surely that's because the bullet is still at the scene of the shooting! Judge: The counsel for the defence is correct. As is clearly shown in this photographic print. Ryunosuke: The bullet that the Skulkin brothers fired at Mr Sholmes hit him in the stomach region... ...then exited his body and lodged into the shop wall where the calendar was hanging by the door. I think you'll find it's really quite simple if you just consider the problem three-dimensionally. Juror No. 4: Hah! Who do you think I am, son? Ryunosuke: ...Um, well, 'juror number four' is about the best I can do. Juror No. 4: As soon as I saw the wound to the man's stomach, I flipped him over. Ryunosuke: ...Like a pancake? Are, are you saying that you checked his back? Juror No. 4: Of course I did! And there wasn't a trace of injury. No sign that the bullet had left the body at all! Ryunosuke: What? Juror No. 4: That's the point! The only logical conclusion was that the bullet was still somewhere in the man's innards! Which is exactly why I set about slicing him up! And I'm still none the wiser, even now! How many times do I have to say it? Can somebody please explain how it happened? Can somebody please solve the mystery! Ryunosuke: ...It's almost as much of a mystery as how this jury was put together. Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"The mystery of where that bullet ended up is infuriating! Where's an expert when you need one?\"Juror No. 4: The mystery of where that bullet ended up is infuriating! Where's an expert when you need one?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes's surgeon is on the jury...? I've experienced some coincidences recently, but this is ridiculous. Juror No. 4: I'm as surprised as anyone! Ryunosuke: But there's no question that Mr Sholmes was shot? Juror No. 4: Well, that's what the police told me when they brought him in. Iris: ...How bad were his injuries, doctor? Juror No. 4: He was in a bad way. He'd lost a huge amount of blood, you know. And I suspect he was shot at quite close range, too. Because his skin was badly burnt around the point of entry. Ryunosuke: Burnt? Juror No. 4: As I said, I flipped the fellow over and examined his back, but there was no sign of an exit wound. Which is why I thought I'd better locate the lug and pop it out. Ryunosuke: And yet you say you found no bullet inside the patient? Juror No. 4: Well I wouldn't have done, would I? Because it's in the wall of the pawnbroker's. But how did it get there?! I need someone to solve this mystery before it drives me to insanity! If only there were some expert in ballistics who could help! Even if he looked extremely untrustworthy! Ryunosuke: (So we have a disappearing bullet on our hands...)Pit against Juror No. 6's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict...the idea that all I do is pit jurors against each other! Juror No. 4: Ooh! A ballistics expert! Juror No. 6: 'Pitting'... 'P-i-t-t-...' Ryunosuke: On the night in question, Mr Sholmes was shot by one of the Skulkin brothers. But since there was no sign of an exit wound on his back, we must assume the bullet didn't pass through him. However, no bullet was found lodged in Mr Sholmes's body, either. Furthermore... ...a bullet was found lodged in the wall of the shop where Mr Sholmes was shot. Juror number six... Juror No. 6: 'Hello. My name is Vilen. Pleased to meet you.' Ryunosuke: This apparent contradiction in the facts that is so clearly troubling juror number four... Are you able to explain the mystery? Juror No. 6: ......... I have seen wery similar situation in motherland. Ryunosuke: ...! Juror No. 6: It was night. There was blizzard. I was running away long mountain round in freezing cold. Judge: Golly. Juror No. 6: The snow was piling high on both sides of road. It was wery narrow and dangerous. My pursuers had hunting rifles and they were on dog sleds. Ryunosuke: (...Mental note: don't ask too many questions.) Juror No. 6: I was shot from behind, and I fell down in snow. And this situation was wery similar to what I hear today from doctor. They could not find bullet in my body. And no sign of - how do you say? - exit wound. Judge: Then, then where did the bullet go? Juror No. 6: Bullet never hit me. Juror No. 4: Well if it never hit you, why did you fall down? Juror No. 6: Bullet hit frozen wall of ice wery close to my side. Ryunosuke: What?! Juror No. 6: One small piece - wery sharp - broke away from lump of ice and pierced my body. It made deep wound that looks just like bullet wound. Juror No. 4: Good gracious... Juror No. 6: Of course, piece of ice quickly melted inside me. And that is solution to mystery of disappearing bullet. Ryunosuke: ......... Juror No. 6: ......... Juror No. 4: But, but that doesn't answer the question at all! Ryunosuke: Hm? Juror No. 4: The shooting happened in a pawnbroker's shop... ...not some snowy mountain road in another country! Ryunosuke: ......... ...Just an idea, but we might not be looking at EXACTLY the same scenario here. Iris: Runo... ...where exactly was Hurley shot again? Ryunosuke: Um, well, according to the report, in his stomach. Sort of around this area, I think. Iris: Well...that's precisely where he always wears a little pouch on his belt. Ryunosuke: A pouch? (Actually, I might have noticed something like that.) Iris: Yes, a pouch. It's where he keeps three glass phials of very dangerous chemicals that he uses in his investigations. Ryunosuke: What?! (Really?) Doctor! Where is the pouch Mr Sholmes was wearing? Juror No. 4: Hm, well... ...the fellow had nothing like that on his person when he arrived at the hospital as far as I remember. Van Zieks: If I may... Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks...? Van Zieks: While I realise it is forbidden for the prosecution to interject during a summation examination... ...I should inform the defence that I have the pouch in question in the antechamber outside the courtroom. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: As I understand it, when the police arrived on the scene and found Mr Sholmes injured... ...they removed the pouch in order to assess the wound. Juror No. 4: Ah! Thank goodness. I thought I was getting forgetful for a moment! Van Zieks: Since then, it has been in my safekeeping along with all other evidence relating to the case. I can personally vouch for the fact that it has not been touched since the incident occurred. Judge: Very well. While extremely unconventional during a summation examination... ...I must demand the prosecution presents the item in question with all speed. Bring forth Mr Herlock Sholmes's pouch! Judge: Hm, I see... So this is the pouch worn by Mr Sholmes on the night in question, is it? Ryunosuke: Look at that! One of the phials is broken and the leather around it is scorched black! It's almost as if...the phial exploded! Judge: Exploded? Ryunosuke: So...that night... ...the bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun struck Mr Sholmes's pouch. Juror No. 4: And it was the glass phial exploding that caused the fellow's injury! Juror No. 6: The bullet did not penetrate wictim, but was deflected into wall of shop. Van Zieks: ......... ...A delightfully complex aroma. Judge: Well, it would appear one mystery has been solved at least. Van Zieks: Though it has no bearing on the truth of this case. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: The bungling and burgling brothers shot the detective, and the accused shot the pawnbroker. The pertinent facts of the case remain unaltered. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Juror No. 4: But at least the mystery is solved! I can sleep easy tonight! Thank you, young man! Juror No. 6: ...Da. 'Thank you wery much.' Ryunosuke: ...Glad I could help. Judge: Due to its bearing on the conundrum just solved, the court will sequester this scruffy pouch as evidence. Iris: Hurley's pouch isn't scruffy! Sholmes's pouch has been entered into the Court Record. Judge: Now, the summation examination... It would appear the defence is somewhat struggling to alter opinion, hm? Ryunosuke: Please, My Lord! A little more time. (After all, that's a new piece of evidence. It could be a valuable clue. And you can't afford to overlook anything here, Ryunosuke. There's still a way to turn this around...somehow. I'm sure of it!) Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.\"Examine evidence Sholmes's Pouch Scorch mark on left side Ryunosuke: (It's really scorched badly just here...) Iris: Oh! The strap is broken, look! Ryunosuke: This must be where the bullet hit, then. Iris: Let me see... Bullet Ryunosuke: Wh-What the... Iris! Look! Behind where the broken phial was... Do you see it? Iris: AAAH! That's... ...the Skulkin brothers' bullet! Ryunosuke: (What a stroke of luck that it hit his pouch!) This is an amazing discovery! (What this means is... ...there were three bullets fired at Windibank's that night!) Iris: We've found exactly what that juror was talking about! The third bullet! Ryunosuke: It's time to press that juror again, I think! The third bullet has been entered into the Court Record. Bullet hole (after examining bullet) Ryunosuke: (This is where the third bullet was lodged. Imagine what would have happened if it had pierced the leather... Thank goodness Mr Sholmes is going to be alright.) Scorch mark on left side (after examining bullet) Ryunosuke: (It's really scorched badly just here...) Iris: Yes, the strap is broken. Ryunosuke: Ripped apart by the bullet, obviously.  Iris: Let me see... Hole on back Ryunosuke: Oh look...there's a hole here at the back. (It doesn't look much like a bullet hole. But clearly something's ripped through the leather with great force.) Iris: Something must have pierced it somehow to have left this hole behind. Ryunosuke: Yes, it looks that way. Mr Sholmes and his pouch both took a beating, didn't they? Broken vial Ryunosuke: This phial has been smashed to pieces. Presumably this is where the bullet struck. Iris: As soon as the bullet hit the chemical in that phial, there would have been a really big explosion. Ryunosuke: A big explosion?! Iris: Well Hurley's potions and chemicals are amazingly useful for the investigation work he does. But they're also quite tricky to handle. Safely, at least. They're very dangerous. Ryunosuke: Oh. Iris: I'm sure that when this phial broke, the chemical inside would have ignited. Ryunosuke: ......... (Note to self: Always walk on the right-hand side of Sholmes in future. The left is the danger zone.) Intact vials Iris: These glass phials are full of Hurley's homemade potions. Ryunosuke: Homemade...? Iris: Yes, like fingerprint powder to show up where people have touched things... ...and scent-amplifying solution to intensify a smell lingering on an object. Ryunosuke: That's...amazing. Iris: They're all very easy to use. There's just one thing that you have to be careful of: They're all very flammable. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes is a walking bomb! (Either he's passionate about finding out the truth, or just oblivious to the dangers...) The Third Bullet Bullet Ryunosuke: This is the bullet that was fired from the Skulkin brothers' gun on the night of the incident. Iris: Yes. So it turns out it never actually entered Hurley's body at all. Ryunosuke: Thanks to the thick leather of that pouch he was wearing. It saved him. Iris: Hehe, Hurley's always lucky like that. Ryunosuke: Well...considering what he had to go through in hospital... ...I wonder how lucky he really was. Iris: Oh dear...poor Hurley...Juror No. 4: Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Then I ask you to reconsider your leaning, sir! Juror No. 4: Oh no, that's another matter entirely. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Juror No. 4: All I can think about for the moment...is this wonderful sense of relief I have that the mystery is solved. I need some time to let that sink in before I could possibly consider anything else. Ryunosuke: Alright... (I thought surgeons had to be able to think quickly...) Iris: Perhaps we should leave him alone for now while he savours his inner peace... ...and focus on some of the other jurors? Ryunosuke: I suppose we'll have to. ...I wish I had the chance to experience inner peace sometimes.Juror No. 5: The accused attempted a theft on the previous day. ...I can see I'm in for a busy day ahead.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you mean, you're in for a busy day? Juror No. 5: Forgot to say. Stop. Do excuse me. Stop. I am a communications officer. Stop. Ryunosuke: A communications officer? Does that have something to do with sending telegrams? Juror No. 5: Everything from personal messages written by members of the public to the latest news in the capital. I convert all the messages into morse code and tap it out to the entire world electronically. Ryunosuke: To...the entire world? Juror No. 5: Thousands of miles of cable under the sea! Stop. Worldwide communication network! Stop. Information transmitted to and from all corners of globe! Stop. Ryunosuke: (Ah yes... ...she was getting equally worked up about radio waves or the like before, wasn't she?) Juror No. 5: I specialise in communicating information from government departments and newspaper offices. Ryunosuke: I see. Juror No. 5: I'm sure I shall have to wire the newspaper reports of today's guilty verdict later. So no sleep for me tonight, I imagine. Ryunosuke: (...Let's just finish the trial first, shall we?)Juror No. 6: I am ballistics expert. I have seen many shootings. There is nothing I do not know about guns.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I thought...you were just a tourist? Juror No. 6: ......... 'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.' Ryunosuke: (...There's no way he's just a 'wisiting' tourist.) So...you're a ballistics expert? ...Who knew? Juror No. 6: I have much experience with guns. Ryunosuke: Ah. Juror No. 6: I have lived through many - how do you say? Em... Extreme...em...wiolent...bath of...em... No. Blood of...em... Iris: Ah! Extreme violent bloodbaths, perhaps? Juror No. 6: Da! Those! Extreme wiolent bloodbaths! ...English is wery difficult language. Ryunosuke: (...Considering the sort of people you associate with, I'm surprised you still have a tongue.) Juror No. 6: Anyway. If you have questions about bullets and guns, you ask me. There is nothing I do not know. No mystery I cannot solve. Ryunosuke: (He's very confident in his knowledge of guns, that's for sure.) Juror No. 6: But...if possible, please, only in Russian language. Iris: He's not very confident in his knowledge of English, though, is he? Ryunosuke: No... Still, we should bear it in mind. (He's our man if there's a mystery about guns or bullets.)Pit against Juror No. 4's statement (after Juror No. 4 changes his statement, before Juror No. 4 changes his statement a second time) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict...the idea that all I do is pit jurors against each other! Juror No. 4: Ooh! A ballistics expert! Juror No. 6: 'Pitting'... 'P-i-t-t-...' Ryunosuke: On the night in question, Mr Sholmes was shot by one of the Skulkin brothers. But since there was no sign of an exit wound on his back, we must assume the bullet didn't pass through him. However, no bullet was found lodged in Mr Sholmes's body, either. Furthermore... ...a bullet was found lodged in the wall of the shop where Mr Sholmes was shot. Juror number six... Juror No. 6: 'Hello. My name is Vilen. Pleased to meet you.' Ryunosuke: This apparent contradiction in the facts that is so clearly troubling juror number four... Are you able to explain the mystery? Juror No. 6: .........

Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.\"Before Sholmes's Pouch is added to Court Record Ryunosuke: (Van Zieks has managed to convince everyone...) Iris: 'When you have eliminated the impossible...' he said. But he hasn't! Ryunosuke: (If we're going to fight back, we need more material. And we have to fight back! We have to turn this trial around again!)After Sholmes's Pouch is added to Court Record Iris: Hurley always turns up at just the right moment! Ryunosuke: ...Does he always come in the form of a pouch? (Seriously though, it sounds like the great detective was on death's door. But maybe his injuries won't be for nothing. That pouch could be a very valuable clue.)Ryunosuke: Here it is. We discovered it just now. Yes! On the night in question in Windibank's pawnbrokery...another bullet was fired!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: What is this new trickery, you Nipponese conjurer?! Where did you find that bullet?Ryunosuke: It was lodged inside Mr Sholmes's pouch.Van Zieks: What?!Ryunosuke: This pouch was removed from around Mr Sholmes's waist before he was taken to hospital. And since then, it has been touched by no one.Judge: Do, do you mean to say... ...the shot fired by the Skulkin brothers that night...Ryunosuke: Yes. As your Lordship has surmised...it hit this pouch.Judge: But that makes no sense whatsoever! We already know the whereabouts of the bullet fired at Mr Sholmes. It's clearly visible in this photographic print!Juror No. 1: Ah!Ryunosuke: Two guns from the scene have already been submitted into the Court Record as evidence.Judge: Yes. That of Mr Windibank, and that belonging to the Skulkin brothers.Ryunosuke: And examination of both guns revealed... ...that only a single bullet had been fired from each.Juror No. 2: Ah!Juror No. 3: But, but that must mean...Ryunosuke: That's right. We now know that on the night in question, three bullets were fired. However! Only two bullets were fired from the guns recovered from the crime scene! And until that incontrovertible inconsistency is somehow explained... ...we cannot and must not pass judgement!Van Zieks: Agk......... AAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! While this summation examination remains incomplete, the court has been presented with new facts. Facts that would appear to shake the very foundations upon which the case against the defendant has been built.Van Zieks: ...!Judge: As is my prerogative in this situation... ...I hereby temporarily suspend the summation examination.Juror No. 1: By Jupiter!Ryunosuke: What?!Judge: Bailiff! Bring the witnesses back to the stand at once!Judge: Witnesses...Nash: Guvnor!Judge: Were you listening to proceedings while the defence carried out the summation examination?Ringo: We woz, guvnor, we woz!Van Zieks: Perhaps we can dispense with the tedious preamble. Simply answer this one question: A third bullet has been identified at the scene of the crime. ...What do you make of that?Nash: Make of it, guv? I dun't make nuffin' of nuffin' if I can 'elp it. Um...Van Zieks: Is it one of yours?Ringo: Gorblimey, guv, gorblimey! Not a chance!Van Zieks: In that case...did you have an accomplice?Nash: Wot?! Eh? Wot?! Never! The Skulkin bruvvers work alone!Ringo: It's just the two of us! That's our trademark!Ryunosuke: (...How soon we forget poor Sulky...)Van Zieks: Only two of the bullets from the crime scene originated from the firearms we have in evidence. The third bullet was fired from another gun. ...Where is it?Nash: Lummy...that's an 'ead-scratcher... .........Judge: Hmmm... Counsel for the Defence...Ryunosuke: Y-Yes?Judge: I should like to hear your thoughts regarding these new developments. The third bullet...and the mysterious missing firearm from whence it came.Ryunosuke: (Thinking back over all the testimony we've heard and all the evidence we've seen... ...I think I'm starting to form a picture. A picture of what really happened that night.) My Lord, I think it's clear what this third bullet tells us about the Skulkin brothers:They had a secret accomplice Ryunosuke: On that night at Windibank's pawnbrokery...the brothers must have been working with a third man. Nash: Erm... Ryunosuke: The witnesses are clearly doing their best to cover up the existence of this accomplice... ...but the evidence all points to the fact that there was someone else present! Someone carrying a gun! Van Zieks: Leads to: \"...An accomplice, you say?\"They had another gun Ryunosuke: On that night at Windibank's pawnbrokery...the brothers must have been in possession of another gun. Nash: Erm... Ryunosuke: We know that only one bullet was fired from each of the two firearms already in the Court Record. The logical conclusion, therefore... ...is that the brothers were working with an accomplice! An accomplice who was carrying a gun! Leads to: \"...An accomplice, you say?\"It's nothing to do with them Ryunosuke: I believe...it has nothing to do with them. Nash: Eh? Ringo: Eh, Nash, eh! That's right! Nash: Yeah! Nuffin' to do wiv us, guv! Ryunosuke: We've established that one bullet was fired from each of the two guns already known to the court. The logical conclusion therefore, is that on the night in question at Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery... ...there was another person present in possession of a third firearm. Van Zieks: ...! Ryunosuke: Whilst the brothers may have had nothing to do with the third gun or the bullet fired from it... ...it's inconceivable that they had nothing to do with the third man. Yes! The brothers were working with an accomplice! An accomplice who was carrying a gun! Leads to: \"...An accomplice, you say?\"Van Zieks: ...An accomplice, you say? Pigswill.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: These protracted proceedings have already forced us to endure two summation examinations. Yet in all that time, there has been not a murmur of a third man. If this apparently wraithlike being exists... ...the court must be shown hard evidence! Without it, this fantasy will be crushed.Ryunosuke: Agh!Van Zieks: The prosecution demands answers on two counts: Firstly: proof - evidence - that this accomplice was ever at the scene of the crime. And secondly... ...the identity of this spurious character.Ryunosuke: (The Skulkins are lying. I know that. But... ...how can I ascertain the identity of the person they're hiding?)Judge: Well, Counsel?Ryunosuke: ......... (I'm supposed to prove the existence of this accomplice... and reveal the person's identity, even...) In response to the prosecution's demands, My Lord, the defence is...Ready to present answers Ryunosuke: The defence is ready. I believe I can provide all the answers the prosecution demands. Van Zieks: So, my Nipponese friend, despite the swimming eyes, you seem to think you have something to say. This promises to be interesting. Ryunosuke: (I have to push forward now. There's no other option. I need to use every single piece of evidence available to me if it will make a difference...) Leads to: \"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Unable to present answers Ryunosuke: The defence is... ......... Van Zieks: Unable to complete a sentence, it would seem. Much less provide any credible answers here. Judge: Yes, it would appear so. Very well, this trial will now- Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Wait! Please! Judge: Good gracious, Counsel! Ryunosuke: (I have to keep the momentum going here. I can't give up now!) Iris: This is just like scientific research if you ask me. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: When you start doubting yourself and thinking you can't possibly work something out, you become blind. Even though in truth, the answer you're looking for is right there in front of you. Ryunosuke: (The answer...is right here in front of me!) ...My Lord! Actually...the defence would like to present answers to the questions posed by the prosecution. Van Zieks: Van Zieks: So, my Nipponese friend, despite the swimming eyes, you seem to think you have something to say. But your earlier tongue-tied display will not go unpunished. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (Now I wish I'd bit my tongue instead of speaking before I'd made up my mind. It would have hurt less.) Leads to: \"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Judge: In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay. On the night in question, in the moments leading up to the death of the victim... ...what proof have you that there was a third intruder present at the scene?Present Blood Samples Portfolio Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The evidence is right here...in this portfolio.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The evidence...is this! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: My learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Ryunosuke: The evidence is right here...in this portfolio.Judge: By Jove! That portfolio again, is it?Van Zieks: Do you expect the court to rifle through your papers itself? Be more specific!Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: You claim one of those blood samples proves the presence of this third intruder. Well, which one is it?Present Windibank's Main Shop sample Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"What am I looking at here?\"Present any other sample Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: THIS is the blood sample that proves it! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! Iris: Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally. Ryunosuke: The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...) Leads back to: \"You claim one of those blood samples proves the presence of this third intruder.\"Judge: What am I looking at here? There appears to be some green paint or suchlike around the bullet hole in the middle of the calendar.Ryunosuke: That's a bloodstain, My Lord.Judge: A bloodstain?Van Zieks: Green blood? Curious, even for you. Is the court to understand that the intruder was some unhuman creature?Ryunosuke: It's...something developed by Mr Herlock Sholmes.Juror No. 3: By the great detective!Juror No. 5: New invention! Stop. Not yet appeared in stories! Stop.Iris: It's this, you see. It...doesn't have a name yet, though. This fogger sprays a chemical that reacts with the different elements in people's blood to change its colour.Judge: Different elements...of people's blood...?Iris: Yes. Everyone's blood is slightly different, you see. Because it's made up of different elements. So by seeing what colour it changes to, you can tell in a flash whose blood it is!Juror No. 3: Ooh! That brings a whole extra dimension to looking at blood!Juror No. 5: Talk of blood in courtroom! Stop. Very exciting! Stop.Ryunosuke: As an example, this one shows the blood of the victim, Mr Windibank.Judge: Ah... A striking blue.Ryunosuke: Yes. So you see, the green colour of this bloodstain on the calendar... ...shows that somebody else was shot in the main part of the shop!Juror No. 1: Now hold fire there, young man! Could be from some unrelated incident, couldn't it?Ryunosuke: No. It's not unrelated.Juror No. 1: ...!Ryunosuke: The date showing on the calendar is the date on which Mr Windibank was killed.Juror No. 1: By golly!Ryunosuke: Therefore we can assume that whoever was shot, was shot on the same day.Juror No. 4: Then whose blood is it?!Ryunosuke: Well, the Skulkin brothers in the stand don't appear to be suffering from any gunshot injuries... Which means it must be the blood of somebody else. The third intruder, in fact.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Whose identity the court is still waiting to hear. You can't delay this any longer, my learned friend. Who is this alleged third intruder?Present Eggert Benedict profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The man's name...is Eggert Benedict.\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: There can be no doubt! THIS is the shadowy accomplice the brothers have been trying so hard to protect! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: A lottery? Is that how you decide who's guilty? Ryunosuke: Hm? Van Zieks: In that case, the name Ryunosuke Naruhodo should be added to the draw. For being guilty of incompetence! Ryunosuke: GAAAAAAGH! (...And I bet my lot would be drawn, too.) Iris: The identity of this accomplice is our trump card, Runo.  Ryunosuke: Yes...I, I expect it is... Iris: At this point, we're the only ones who know the person's identity. But it's time to stun the courtroom now! Let's give everyone something to think about! Ryunosuke: Yes... YES! Leads back to: \"You can't delay this any longer, my learned friend.\"!Ryunosuke: The man's name...is Eggert Benedict.Judge: Eggert Benedict?! Who on earth are you talking about, Counsel?Ryunosuke: He paid a visit to Windibank's pawnbrokery on the afternoon before the incident took place.Van Zieks: When the accused attempted to deceive the pawnbroker into releasing this article into her possession.Ryunosuke: ...That's right.Van Zieks: ...!Ryunosuke: The man identified by the defence, Mr Eggert Benedict... ...then attempted to take the article from the defendant by force.???: Broker!Windibank: Um, yes, sir????: I believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemed an article from you, no?Windibank: Yes, yes, erm...???: The article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once.Gina: Now that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull????: Give me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box disks, too.Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson was there at the time, and can attest to what happened. In the end, it was the inspector himself who took the disk.Judge: Can you corroborate this account, Inspector?Gregson: Erm, yes, My Lord. That's more or less what happened. And in the interests of bein' thorough, I asked Windibank for a print showin' the fellow. Taken from one of his 'Red-Handed Recorder' gubbinses.Ryunosuke: (Yes! That's him talking to Mr Windibank that morning.)Judge: And you claim this man is the brothers' accomplice?Ryunosuke: Well, Mr and Mr Skulkin?Nash: ......... Never seen the geezer before in me life!Ringo: On me life, guv, on me life! Never seen 'im!Judge: Well...somewhat unsurprisingly, it appears our witnesses disagree with the assertion.Van Zieks: I'm sure Your Lordship recalls my learned Nipponese friend's actual assertion. Which was that he could prove the identity of the alleged accomplice.Ryunosuke: Yes, and I can!Juror No. 3: Then show us the evidence!Juror No. 2: I agree! We must see proof that the clean-cut gentleman in the photograph is the filthy criminal you say he is!Ryunosuke: ......... (This is the last piece of evidence... I've had a feeling that something has been missing in this trial from the very start. But now...I'm going to drag it kicking and screaming into the courtroom!)Judge: Are you ready to present your answer to the court then, Counsel?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. The defence will present the evidence now. Proof that the man pictured in this photographic print was in fact the person struck by the third bullet!Present Music Box Disk (after examining bloodstain during trial) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question...\"Present Blood Samples Portfolio Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That proof is right here, in this portfolio! Judge: Good gracious, Counsel! Does that portfolio contain the answers to every question posed? Van Zieks: ...I see you share my interest in claret-coloured liquids, my Nipponese friend. But... Enough. The court demands to see further evidence. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Which blood sample proves the man you identified was the one shot by the third bullet at the scene of the crime? Present Music Box Disk sample Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question...\" Present any other sample Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: THIS is the blood sample that proves it! Judge: ...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer. Ryunosuke: Ah. Van Zieks: You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen. Ryunosuke: AAARGH! (It has to be a sample that links the bloodstain at the scene to Mr Benedict...) Iris: In other words, we need a sample of blood that turned the same colour as that bloodstain. Ryunosuke: (Another green sample? ...Did we have one of those?) Iris: I think perhaps you should have another look through everything, Runo. Ryunosuke: Right. I might need to go over the evidence again. (Where else did we notice a bloodstain?) Leads back to: \"Enough. The court demands to see further evidence.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Here it is! This is the irrefutable evidence! Judge: I'm sorry, Counsel, but I fail to see the connection. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: It seems my learned friend is wide of the mark...again. In fact...he has just shot himself in the foot! Ryunosuke: GYAAAAAAGH! (I'll have to try that one more time. Even though my foot is killing me here...) Judge: I might remind you, Counsel, of the gravity of the choices you make in this courtroom. Think very carefully. Leads back to: \".........\"Ryunosuke: As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question... ...the defendant attempted - deceitfully, admittedly - to reclaim this disk from Windibank's.Judge: Which is when the aforementioned Eggert Benedict appeared on the scene, I believe. This man then attempted to purloin the article from the defendant's possession, no?Ryunosuke: That's correct, My Lord. I myself was present at the time. It was following this that a minor incident occurred.Windibank: But of course, sir. Here is the disk for you.Benedict: ......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style.Gina: Wait a minute! That disk... ...is mine!Benedict: Argh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal!Ryunosuke: Being a music box disk, it has countless small but sharp metal protrusions over its surface. Those protrusions caused Mr Benedict's finger to bleed. And the resulting smear of blood is still visible on the disk now.Judge: Goodness! A bloodstain, is it?Ryunosuke: My assistant and I have just analysed the bloodstain here in this very courtroom.Iris: Using...my trusty fogger gun!Ryunosuke: Yes. And we added the results to this portfolio.Juror No. 1:I say!Juror No. 2:It's green!Juror No. 5:It's exactly the same colour as the blood around the calendar!Ryunosuke: The evidence is conclusive! The man calling himself Mr Eggert Benedict, who was in Windibank's earlier in the day... ...is the accomplice who was present at the scene of the crime that same night!So there was someone else there! Look at those two brothers now! They're sweating buckets!Oi! Who are you talkin' about? ...It's boilin' in 'ere!Ryunosuke: My Lord! It is the opinion of the defence... ...that Mr Eggert Benedict...should be summoned to the courtroom to testify!Judge: Hmmm... It would certainly seem that we can ill afford to ignore this gentleman's apparent presence.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ...This has gone on long enough now. This flagrant ignorance of the mechanics of law.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: Herlock Sholmes, you say? Yes, I've heard the name. The protagonist in a series of short stories for the vulgar classes. A god of detection or some such.Iris: ...!Van Zieks: And now you employ chemical substances devised by this fantastical persona in the highest court in the land? Do you expect us to take you seriously? The samples made by this plaything are not fit to be called evidence.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: So the bloodstain turned a shade of green. What of it? Here's to you successfully proving that no other blood in the world would turn the same colour.Ryunosuke: Ah...well...Van Zieks: And pray, do not even think of suggesting that we should take Mr Sholmes's word for it!Ryunosuke: Ugh...Is he right? Is Mr Sholmes's concoction a load of rubbish? I don't know... I mean, he is a great detective.What are you talking about?! We can't let him get away with that!Ryunosuke: ......... (I knew it would come to this. Of course Mr Sholmes's invention isn't going to be recognised by any official body. But...what other choice did I have...?)Iris: Hm... I'm just remembering what Father Christmas over there said before. About how he was temporarily suspending the summation examination.Ryunosuke: Ah!Iris: In other words... ...the examination isn't over yet, is it?Judge: G-Good grief! What did you just say, young girl?Iris: And in a summation examination, the decision as to whether or not the trial continues... ...is in the hands of the six jurors, isn't it?Van Zieks: ...!Iris: So the way I see it... ...it doesn't matter what certain other people think of Hurley's invention. At least, not for now!Ryunosuke: Yes! (She's right!)Judge: Young lady, you have quite the devious mind!Iris: It really just comes down to one thing: Whether these ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...are convinced by what you say, Runo! ...Is that about right, would you say? Or did I misunderstand something?Ryunosuke: (Unbelievable! Mr Sholmes's partner is a force to be reckoned with!)Iris: Iris Wilson...sharpshooter!Judge: After that shrewd precis of the situation from an entirely unexpected source... ...it must be acknowledged that the previous summation examination has yet to reach its conclusion.Van Zieks: This is absurd!Judge: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the court now looks to you for your final leanings in this matter.Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Judge: As proud citizens of Her Majesty's Britain, I'm sure you will come to fair and just conclusions.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Judge: So then, state your final decisions in turn, please.Juror No. 1: Not guilty!Juror No. 2: Not guilty!Juror No. 3: Not guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Not guilty!Judge: Two call guilty, and four call not guilty. Such is the outcome of the summation examination.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: My Lord, with all due respect, this is an outrage! The prosecution refuses to accept this decision!Judge: ...On what grounds?Van Zieks: If these jurors are persuaded by some half-baked concoction devised by a pretender to real police work... ...then they are too ignorant to be trusted with the judgement of anyone's guilt.Judge: I'm sorry, Lord van Zieks, but the outcome of the summation examination cannot be ignored. This trial will continue!Van Zieks: Agk......... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge: ...Nevertheless, we find ourselves in a rather awkward situation. The defence has very reasonably requested the subpoena of a new witness. But sadly, I fear that will be impossible.Ryunosuke: What?Judge: The name the gentleman gave for himself - Eggert Benedict - is quite clearly false.Ryunosuke: (I don't believe it! Just when I'd managed to prove the man was there that night...)???:...Um... Could, could I say something?Judge: ...? Who was that, please? Who spoke?Juror No. 5: Um...it was me, My Lord.Ryunosuke: (Juror number five...?)Judge: What have you to say, madam?Juror No. 5: If possible...Inspector...Gregson: Eh? ...Me, ma'am?Juror No. 5: I wonder if you might show the photographic print to me again? The one in which the gentleman is shown.Gregson: Ah, right, yes. This one, you mean? Of Mr Benedict?Juror No. 5: ......... ......... .........Yes... There's no doubt in my mind.Ryunosuke: Juror number five, you don't mean to say... You know this man?Juror No. 5: Yes, I know him.Ryunosuke: What?!Van Zieks: No!Judge: GOOD GRACIOUS!!! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Juror number five! How on earth...?Juror No. 5: I am a communications officer. Stop.Ryunosuke: ...As we can clearly see...Juror No. 5: The gentleman in the photograph is... Stop. ...also a communications officer. Stop. He works in my office. Stop. A very talented operator in fact! Stop. He should be in the communication station now. Stop. Tapping away on the telegraph. Stop.Ryunosuke: (This doesn't seem right somehow... I can't put my finger on why, but...it doesn't feel right.)Iris: Hm... I suppose we all imagined the accomplice would be some sort of hardened criminal. It's...a bit unexpected to find out that he has a respectable job by day, whatever he gets up to at night.Ryunosuke: Yes...I suppose that's it. (I suppose that's why I felt something was wrong...)Judge: If the gentleman is at London's communication station, we should be able to subpoena him within the hour. Lord van Zieks, if you please...Van Zieks: ...Yes, My Lord?Judge: Make the necessary arrangements with all haste!Van Zieks: As Your Lordship bids.Judge: The court will recess for one hour. When the new witness arrives, we shall reconvene to hear the gentleman's testimony. Inspector Gregson...Gregson: Yes, My Lord?Judge: I should like to hear from you specifically about events at the pawnbrokery on the day in question. Come to my chambers during the recess.Gregson: Yes, sir, My Lord.Judge: Very well... Court is adjourned until 1:40 p.m.!To be continued...17th April, 12:41 p.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberRyunosuke: Ah, Gina. How are you holding up?Gina: .........Ryunosuke: (I'm starting to feel quite warmly towards her frequent cold shoulders now.)Iris: Ginny! Are you alright? Why aren't you saying anything?Gina: ......... Wot's the point, eh? Why go to all this trouble an' fight so 'ard...for the likes o' me?Iris: What?Gina: Well you saw it! That picture.Ryunosuke: What picture?Iris: Ah, you mean this? The photograph taken by Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder. Well, I didn't think it would have captured a scene like this, that's for sure!Gina: It's 'opeless. Anyone who sees that's gonna think I did it, ain't they?Ryunosuke: Well...I won't pretend it wasn't a bit of a shock when the prosecution first presented it to the court.Gina: Surely you've gotta 'ave yer doubts about me now. Ya can't still think I'm innocent.Ryunosuke: ......... Of course I can.Gina: Hmph.........Iris: Ginny...why don't you talk to us? Tell us what really happened that night.Gina: Eh?Iris: Runo's cleverly managed to piece together a lot of new information, but still... ...we'd really like to hear it from you.Gina: ......... Alright then. It was after we'd 'ad that dinner together at your place, right, Iris? Then we all 'ad a chat up in your office, didn't we?Ryunosuke: Yes, I remember.Gina: After that, I just couldn't get to sleep. So I slipped out an' went down the street to the two-to-one. To Windibank's place. ...I 'ad to know.Ryunosuke: If Iris's story was there or not? 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.Gina: I dunno wot it's about or nuffin'... ...but if you ask me, there's somefin' in it that Sholmes don't like. Somefin' wot 'e don't want people readin'. So that's why 'e lied to Iris about stickin' it in lug wiv Windibank for safekeepin'. At least, that's wot I thought at the time.Ryunosuke: So you broke into Windibank's?Gina: I just 'ad to know if it was there or not. I mean, I 'ad no idea all o' that was gonna kick off, did I? I struck the lock and snuck inside. It was dark as you like in there. So I gave the oil lamp on the counter a bit o' wick. And that's when...What d'you think you're doing?!AAAAAAGH!Gina: I nearly died, I did! And the next thing I knew... ...I'd grabbed the gun off the counter and was wavin' it in the air like...I dunno wot.Ah...you're the girl who was in here this afternoon. I didn't think pickpockets went in for armed robbery.The, the mantelscript... 'Ave you got it 'ere? Did Sholmes leave a load o' papers wiv you? A story.Windibank:I beg your pardon?Gina:'The Hound o' the...' somefin'-or-other. If it's 'ere, I wanna see it!Windibank:I'm sorry, young lady... ...but I'd sooner die than relinquish an article belonging to one of my customers.Gina:I don't want it! Wot would I do wiv it anyway? I just...wanna see it's 'ere, that's all.Windibank:Oh, you want to see it, do you?Gina:I wanna know if Sholmes really pawned it 'ere or not. Please! Just let me see it an' I'll go.Windibank:......... Oh, very well then. But for pity's sake, stop waving my gun around, would you?Gina: So then the old cove unlocked the storeroom door, and we both went inside. And it was there alright. The mantelscript. Sholmes weren't lyin' after all.Iris: You did all that just to check for me, Ginny?Gina: ...Anyway, then there was a bit of a kick-up out in the main bit o' the shop.Ryunosuke: The Skulkin brothers arriving on the scene, yes.Gina:Wot was that noise? Someone's breakin' in!Windibank:Dear me, is there some burglars' convention here tonight that I don't know about?Gina:...I think I forgot to shut the door be'ind me. Sorry.Windibank:I'd better go and take care of it. Could I possibly have my gun back?Gina:Oh, well I'll come wiv ya and-Windibank:Now don't be foolish, young girl. You must stay right here. Don't leave this room under any circumstances.Gina: An' wiv that, 'e took the gun out of me 'ands and walked back out into the shop. I 'ung back in the storeroom like 'e said, strainin' me ears in the dark to 'ear wot was goin' on. It sounded like they got into a bit of a scrap. I started to think I should 'elp, see. So I was just about to go out the storeroom myself, when...*BANG!**BANG!*Gina: I 'eard a couple o' shots go off. Two, I think. Almost at the same time. And then there 'e was, right at me feet. Lyin' face down on the floor! I was right next to the storeroom door, so I slammed it shut an' locked it quick as ya like.Ryunosuke: Because you thought whoever had shot Mr Windibank might come for you?Gina: Yeah. So I went to grab the old cove's gun. I figured I'd put up a fight at least. But when I got a better look at 'im, I knew... ...Windibank was a goner. I felt funny in me 'ead all of a sudden. Kind of dizzy. And after that...I don't remember nuffin'.Ryunosuke: That must be when you passed out, Gina.Gina: ......... If...if I 'adn't done wot I done... ...the old cove might still be alive!Ryunosuke: Did you tell the police everything you just told us?Gina: 'Course I did! But they didn't believe a word of it, did they? All they said was, if I kept tellin' lies, it'd make things even worse for me. .........Iris: It'll be alright, Ginny, don't worry. Just stay strong a little longer. Runo's about to put the real culprit through the mill!Gina: ......... That cove wot was there in the afternoon? That Eggert Benedict...I still remember 'ow 'e looked at me. Like I was nuffin'. 'E...'e was there that night.Ryunosuke: We don't know his real name yet... ...but I'm convinced that he's involved somehow.Gina: .........Ryunosuke: Anyway, thank you for telling us what happened, Gina. I appreciate your honesty.Gina: You wot?Iris: You can leave it all in Runo's capable hands now, Ginny!Gina: ......... Mr Narra-'Oddo...Ryunosuke: Yes?Gina: ...'Ow come you trust me? I don't get it.Ryunosuke: .........Gina: I mean, 'ave you forgotten wot 'appened 'ere before? Come on, it was only two months ago. Me and McGilded...we told you a whole pack o' lies. An' you got the bogtrotter off wiv 'em! Even though 'e was a killer!Ryunosuke: ......... No, I could never forget that.Gina: Oh...Ryunosuke: (I did what I thought was best at the time. But the pain of that error of judgement doesn't get any easier to bear.) Still, don't forget that I also made you a promise. I told you that I'd be on your side to the bitter end, no matter what.Gina: But wot if I'm lyin'?! You could be workin' to get another killer off the 'ook for all you know!Ryunosuke: ......... I was once in your position, Gina. I was the accused in a trial.Gina: You were?Ryunosuke: Before I left Japan. I was accused of murder. And strange as it might sound, the circumstances of the crime were pretty damning. I was sure that no one would believe it wasn't me who'd done it.Iris: Oh, Runo...Ryunosuke: But there was one person who stood up for me. Who believed in me, and was prepared to defend me. My best friend.Ryunosuke, no one believes in you more than I do. Leave this to me. All you need to do is put your faith in me, and I'll do the rest!Ryunosuke: I was so happy, I cried. But even then... ...somewhere inside me, I couldn't help thinking: 'Surely he doesn't really believe in me. Not completely.'Gina: ...!Ryunosuke: But...I was wrong.As soon as my trial began, it was obvious... ...that he had an absolute, unwavering belief in me. And in turn, I developed an absolute, unwavering belief in him.Ryunosuke: Since then, I came to realise... ...if you want someone to believe in you, you have to believe in the other person first.Gina: Wot are you sayin'...?Ryunosuke: I promise you, Gina, that no matter what happens, I'll keep believing in you. So you don't need to worry. I won't let you down.Gina: ......... Even though I'm a diver? ...And a no-good liar?Ryunosuke: ......... You're not like McGilded. I know that.Gina: Eh?Iris: That's right! You're our friend, Ginny!Gina: I-Iris!Ryunosuke: We know you better than you think. And we've come to the conclusion that you're someone we can trust.Iris: Yes!Ryunosuke: That's really all we need to know.Iris: Exactly!Gina: Um...Mr Narra-'Oddo, I, um... I... *Sniffle, sniffle*Bailiff: Defendant Gina Lestrade and her legal representative! Court proceedings are about to resume. Please head into the courtroom immediately!Ryunosuke: Yes, of course! Thank you.I'd been both a defendant and a defending lawyer in my time. So I knew only too well... ...just how hard it was to put all your faith in another. And I also knew... ...just how hard it was to bear the burden of another putting all their faith in you. (This is it at last. The final chapter. The final battle. Wish me luck, Susato-san... And I hope you're watching over me too...partner!)17th April, 1:41 p.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: I hereby call this court to order as we resume the trial of Miss Gina Lestrade. Lord van Zieks, have you successfully subpoenaed the witness?Van Zieks: The subpoena was delivered to the communication station where the man works immediately, My Lord. However, the heavy rain has delayed the arrival of his carriage, it would seem.Judge: Hm, I see. Then let us turn our attention to Inspector Gregson's precis of the case heard by the court this morning. The glaring omission of the third bullet in your report is a serious blunder, Inspector.Gregson: Yes, um, I can only apologise, My Lord.Judge: And although the defence's chemical analysis of the blood at the scene makes for a compelling argument... ...I cannot permit such untried methods to be used as evidence in my courtroom.Iris: Hmph! It's a big mistake to cross Hurley and me. A very big mistake!Bailiff: My Lord! The subpoenaed witness has just arrived in the building.Judge: Thank you, Officer. Show him to the stand without delay.Ryunosuke: (Mr Eggert Benedict... I didn't expect to be crossing paths with him again so soon. And certainly not like this.)Judge: Thank you for complying with the court's subpoena at such short notice, sir.???: But of course, My Lord. As an upstanding member of London society, it is my pleasure to oblige.Judge: Now, kindly state your name and occupation for the record.Graydon: Ashley Graydon, communications officer.Juror No. 5: Mr Graydon and I both work at London's central communication station.Graydon: Now perhaps somebody would kindly explain what all this is about?Van Zieks: You were apprised of the situation by the court officer on your way here, I presume.Graydon: Yes, I was. Something to do with a murder that took place at a pawnbroker's on Baker Street. And some nonsense about me having been there on the night in question.Van Zieks: That is the accusation, indeed.Graydon: This really is beyond a joke, you know.Judge: Very well. Without further delay, the court will hear your testimony now, Mr Graydon. You will respond to the accusation made against you under oath.Graydon: Gladly, My Lord. Gladly.Witness Testimony - The Accusation -Graydon: Naturally, I have occasion to make use of pawnbroking services from time to time. But are you seriously suggesting I colluded with these thugs to break into the place on the night of the murder? ...I have no intention of admitting to such an outrageous accusation. Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene. Some scaramouch detective's homebrewed tincture can hardly be taken as serious evidence.Judge: So...you deny the accusation completely, do you?Graydon: I must say, I am dismayed. For the highest court in the land to be swayed by this self-professed detective's toy...Van Zieks: It was the will of the jury. And our great British justice system demands that the jury's will is upheld.Graydon: Then it would seem we have the misfortune of a most inept assembly of jurors today.Juror No. 1: ...! By golly!Graydon: How long am I expected to be detained here?Judge: If, following the defence's cross-examination, your involvement in this matter has not been established... ...you will be free to leave immediately.Graydon: Good. Then I shall be away in time for afternoon tea. Some small consolation at least.Judge: Let us not hold up Mr Graydon any longer than necessary, Counsel. Proceed with the cross-examination.Ryunosuke: So...we meet again, Mr Eggert Benedict. Or is it Mr Graydon?Graydon: ......... My apologies. You are...?Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke Naruhodo, defence lawyer. We have met.Graydon: If you say so. Ashley Graydon. Enchanté. So...Ryunosuke: Agh!Graydon: ...I trust we can conclude this quickly.Ryunosuke: Ugh... (But I'm NOT holding your flashy hat while we do.)Cross-Examination - The Accusation -Graydon: Naturally, I have occasion to make use of pawnbroking services from time to time.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Yes, we even met in the very pawnbrokery where the crime took place on the afternoon of the day in question. Though of course...you introduced yourself by a different name at the time. Graydon: ...! Ryunosuke: It was Mr Eggert Benedict, I believe. Tell me, what made you- Van Zieks: Van Zieks: The witness is here to testify about events that took place that night. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: He is under no obligation to answer such unrelated questions. Ryunosuke: You can't be serious! Graydon: ...Thank you. Because I certainly do not feel inclined to answer such an inappropriate question. Ryunosuke: (So he's going to be evasive, is he? In an effort not to give anything away. This could be tricky...) Graydon: .........Graydon: But are you seriously suggesting I colluded with these thugs to break into the place on the night of the murder?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Have you seen these two men before? Graydon: This pair? ...No. I don't associate with criminals. Ryunosuke: (Said by a man who introduced himself as 'Eggert Benedict'...) Graydon: I'd like to know who I have to thank for this. Who made this outlandish accusation against me? Van Zieks: The young lawyer there in the black. Graydon: This is a farce! Whose idea was it to permit an outsider to work in a British court anyway? Ryunosuke: ...! Graydon: Well, needless to say...Graydon: ...I have no intention of admitting to such an outrageous accusation.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Where were you at around one in the morning on the night in question, sir? Graydon: That is past the hour at which I would normally retire. Certainly... ...I was not in the company of these rapscallions. Ryunosuke: You're able to prove that? Graydon: ......... Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Listen carefully, my learned Nipponese friend... ...for you appear to be under a gross misapprehension on this point. Ryunosuke: What do you mean? Van Zieks: The witness maintains he was not at the scene of the crime. He has no obligation to prove his absence. If your accusation is that the witness was present at the scene... ...the obligation lies with you to prove your assertion. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: You will fulfil that obligation before putting any more unreasonable questions to the witness. Ryunosuke: (A silent victory wiggle. Thanks.)Graydon: Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Blood was found at the scene of the crime. There's no question of that. Mr Sholmes's chemical analysis has positively identified the substance as such. Graydon: But I am not the only human to have blood running through my veins, am I? How can you be sure that the blood is mine? It could equally be the blood of one of these two miscreants. Ryunosuke: Every individual's blood has a slightly different composition, it seems. Mr Sholmes's chemical is able to differentiate different blood samples by- Graydon: Spare me the science lesson! ...Who is this Sholmes character anyway? Ryunosuke: Oh. I, I assumed all Londoners would know the name. He's a grea- Well, a renowned detective. Van Zieks: So, even you are unable to bring yourself to say 'great detective'. Graydon: A great detective, you say? Tsk! Now we're in the realm of fairy tales, are we? The counsel for the defence thinks a British courtroom is an appropriate place for fairy tales, does he? Pursue Nash Skulkin Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to say about that, Mr Skulkin? Ringo: Eh? Wot? Me? Ryunosuke: ...No, the Mr Skulkin next to you. Gregson: Right, I've had it up to here with this! How many times have I gotta tell you? Ryunosuke: Yes, I know. You're not 'Big Bruv Sulky'. Mr Nash Skulkin! Nash: Eh? Cor blimey, guvnor! You wot?! Ryunosuke: Is it not the case that when Mr Graydon just spoke, a thought went through your mind? Would you care to share that thought with the court? Nash: Eh? Me thoughts? I dun 'ave none o' them! It must've been 'im! Ringo: You wot?! Ryunosuke: Mr Nash Skulkin! ...Answer the question, please. What went through your mind when Mr Graydon just spoke? Nash: Nuffin'! Honest, guv! Nuffin'! I, I woz just thinkin'... ...if 'e waves 'is arm around like that much more, it'll open up the wound again, that's all! Ryunosuke: What wound? Nash: Where 'e took the bullet, o' course! It woz only two days ago. It ain't gonna be 'ealed up yet! So I woz, um... Well, ya know... I woz worryin' for 'im, and... ......... Oh, 'ell's bells! Ryunosuke: Mr Graydon! Did you hear that? Graydon: What? Ryunosuke: Your comrade is worried about you, it seems. ...On account of your injured arm. Graydon: ......... My Lord. Judge: Yes, Mr Graydon? Graydon: I have no idea what these two wretches are talking about. Certainly, I shouldn't be expected to answer anything in relation to their mindless insinuations. Judge: Hmmm... Ryunosuke: We know that someone other than the victim was hit by a bullet at the scene of the crime two nights ago. And from the height of the bullet hole in the wall, that person was likely hit in the upper arm or thereabouts. Graydon: ......... Ryunosuke: Perhaps you'd allow a court official to examine your arm, sir? The left arm that you're currently clasping with your right hand, as if in pain! Graydon: ......... No. ...I refuse. Ryunosuke: ...! Graydon: You have shown no evidence whatsoever that links me to these common thieves. Accordingly, I am not obliged to permit any such invasion of my privacy! As I've already said, I'm completely uninvolved in all this. I've never had anything to do with the pawnbrokery where this fellow was killed whatsoever! I take offence at the insinuation that I was in any way involved! Judge: Hm...you claim to have had nothing whatsoever to do with Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery? Ryunosuke: My Lord! The defence would like that last statement to be added to Mr Graydon's formal testimony. Judge: Very well, Counsel. Continue with your testimony, My Graydon. Graydon: ......... Removes statement \"Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene.\" Adds statement \"The bottom line is, I've never had anything to do with the pawnbroking establishment where the man was killed!\" Ryunosuke: Ugh... Iris: Argh! This is so unfair! That chemical test is based on solid science! Hurley and I know what we're doing! Ryunosuke: The trouble is, unless the technique can be independently verified... ...we'll never get beyond this man's flashy stick-waving. Graydon: Granted, it is a very colourful alchemy. Perhaps it would make a good souvenir for your uneducated friends back home in the East. Ryunosuke: (Something riled him there. Just for a moment, Mr Graydon let his feathers get ruffled...) Graydon: But a souvenir is all it's good for.Graydon: Some scaramouch detective's homebrewed tincture can hardly be taken as serious evidence.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Don't forget, sir, that Mr Herlock Sholmes is the most famous detective in the world. Graydon: And the most famous detective in the world tells the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, hm? Ryunosuke: Erm, well, um... (Oh no! I can't think how to answer that!) Van Zieks: I once saw the world's most famous swindler thrown into jail. He allegedly told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but...what turned out to be a pack of lies. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Graydon: Quite. Now... ...as you are no doubt aware, the central communication station is the heart of this country's information network. My work there is of paramount importance. And you have kept me from it for long enough already.Graydon: The bottom line is, I've never had anything to do with the pawnbroking establishment where the man was killed!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Never had anything to do with it? You forget that I was there, Mr Graydon! On the very afternoon of the incident! Graydon: ...Obviously, I am not a complete stranger to the pawnbroker's. I'm currently on the lookout for an armchair to furnish my study. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: No! You were there to redeem an article! Graydon: I have no idea what you're talking about. Pursue Tobias Gregson Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to add, Inspector? Gregson: Eh? Come again, sunshine? Ryunosuke: You were there, too, in fact, weren't you, Inspector? That afternoon. Gregson: ......... Well yes, I do remember meetin' yourself in the pawnbroker's that afternoon. You, your young Japanese assistant, and the accused were all present, as I recall. Ryunosuke: And at that time, this witness, Mr Graydon, was trying to acquire a particular article... Gregson: Um...well now... Ryunosuke: ...! Gregson: I'm afraid I don't remember too clearly. Ryunosuke: What?! But, but you must! Gregson: I'm not going to lie and pretend I remember somethin' that I don't. Ryunosuke: ...! (What's going on here?) Iris: Gregsy showed us a picture before, didn't he? You know, from the cameras that Hurley installed in Windibank's. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, of course. Judge: Indeed. And the gentleman pictured bears a striking resemblance to the witness, I must say. Ryunosuke: Exactly! Which proves that Mr Graydon was in the shop on the afternoon in question! Graydon: At no point have I denied that fact. Ryunosuke: ...! Graydon: I merely entered the shop to peruse the articles on sale and have a word with the broker. Nothing more. Gregson: ......... Ryunosuke: (This makes no sense. I understand why Mr Graydon might be trying to cover his tracks... ...but why would Gregson be trying to avoid giving testimony about what happened?) Leads back to cross-examination Ryunosuke: Sorry? Graydon: You must be confusing me with somebody else. I wasn't there for any such purpose. Ryunosuke: But, but the redemption article! Iris: That won't get you anywhere, Runo. Ryunosuke: Iris! ...What do you mean? Iris: Mr Windibank never wrote the names of his customers on his redemption tickets. So you can't prove the ticket was his. Ryunosuke: Ah! (Of course... She's right.) Iris: I'm afraid... ...you're going to need to produce some irrefutable evidence here. Otherwise he'll never admit to being there. Ryunosuke: Hm...irrefutable evidence...Present Music Box Disk Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Have you ever seen this disk before, Mr Graydon?\"Before correctly pursuing Nash Skulkin Ryunosuke: (That's all he's going to say on the matter, is it?) Iris: What do you think, Runo? Ryunosuke: I think he has no intention of telling us anything. He's well aware that the less he says, the less chance he has of giving himself away. Iris: Hm... The complete opposite of Hurley, then. He seems to think that the more he says, the better. Ryunosuke: I need to find a way of getting more information out of this man somehow... (But compared to the bungling burglars beside him, he seems as innocent as a child.) Iris: Or perhaps the Skulkin brothers might be the key here? Ryunosuke: Oh... (Could they be somehow...?) Iris: Remember, if you don't prove this witness has some connection to the incident here, he'll be free to leave. Ryunosuke: I know. I can't let that happen. (Let's listen to those statements again and see if there's any way I can make one of them tell us more.)After correctly pursuing Nash Skulkin Ryunosuke: (That's all he's going to say on the matter, is it?) Iris: What do you think, Runo? Ryunosuke: I think he has no intention of telling us anything. He's well aware that the less he says, the less chance he has of giving himself away. Iris: Hm... The complete opposite of Hurley, then. He seems to think that the more he says, the better. Ryunosuke: Well, at least I managed to prise a little more information from these witnesses' lips. All thanks to the Skulkin brothers... Iris: Yes! They were the key to it after all! Ryunosuke: So he says he had nothing to do with Windibank's... (Well, we know that's not true.) Iris: Perhaps now would be a good time to have a proper look through the Court Record. Ryunosuke: Good idea. You never know what tiny scrap of information could become a valuable weapon...Ryunosuke: Have you ever seen this disk before, Mr Graydon?Graydon: ......... Why? Is it supposed to mean something?Ryunosuke: This disk was, until the day of his murder, in pawn in Mr Windibank's shop. It was redeemed by the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade that afternoon. However... ...somebody mysteriously appeared to try to take it from her. And that somebody was you, of course. Wasn't it, Mr Graydon?Graydon: As I have reiterated numerous times now...you are mistaken. That was not me. I've never seen that disk before in my life.Ryunosuke: It may have escaped your notice, but there is a small smear of blood on the disk.Judge: Ah yes. Resulting from an abrasion of the thumb, perhaps?Ryunosuke: That's right. The surface of the disk is covered in hundreds of tiny metal bumps. In the skirmish to acquire the disk, the thumb of the person who tried to take it suffered minor lacerations.Graydon: ...!Ryunosuke: So! While the disk bears the remnants of that skirmish in the form of this smear of blood... ...the thumb of the person in question must bear the remnants also. In the form of a scratch!Judge: Good gracious! Indeed it must!Ryunosuke: Mr Graydon!Graydon: ...!Ryunosuke: You refused to allow a court officer to examine your arm before. Are you now going to refuse to allow us to examine your thumb? Because I have no doubt that it bears a small scratch consistent with the smear of blood on this disk!Graydon: ...! ......... Well well... ...it would seem I underestimated you.Judge: What, what is the meaning of this?Ryunosuke: So you admit it now? You admit you have a scratch on your thumb from when you attempted to take the disk from the defendant?!Judge: Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! ...Well, Mr Graydon?Graydon: ...It would appear there has been something of a misunderstanding here. I did not attempt to take the disk, as you put it. No, quite the reverse.Ryunosuke: What are you trying to say?Graydon: It's really quite simple, you see. The disk was mine from the outset. Is there some crime in taking an item that you own out of pawn?Ryunosuke: What?!Van Zieks: It would seem, Mr Graydon... ...that in this piece of evidence, my learned friend has established a link between yourself and the incident. Accordingly...you will tell the court everything you know about this disk now.Graydon: ...As you wish. Though I'm quite sure it has nothing whatsoever to do with the pawnbroker's murder.Witness Testimony - The Disk -Graydon: There's a note on the disk saying, 'For McGilded', but the item belongs to me. The redemption ticket was stolen from me by the accused - that filthy gutterling - on the day in question. I proceeded at once to the shop in order to explain my situation and redeem my article. In the end, of course, the disk was taken by the police. In other words...I had absolutely no reason to break into the shop later that same night.Judge: Did I hear you correctly, sir? 'McGilded', you say? The famous London philanthropist? Who perished in this very courtroom two months ago after being acquitted of a distinctly messy murder?Graydon: Yes, My Lord. The one and the same.Judge: Good Lord! Mr Graydon! Are you saying that Mr McGilded and yourself were acquainted?Graydon: ......... Yes. That's correct.Judge: Ordaaar! ...Well. I certainly didn't expect to hear that name uttered here in my courtroom again.Ryunosuke: (According to what Gina told us, this disk was placed in pawn on that fateful night two months ago. McGilded himself gave instructions to deposit it at Windibank's.)Iris: It's funny that Mr Graydon here is claiming the disk belongs to him then, isn't it?Ryunosuke: In all likelihood, he's lying. (So he appeared that afternoon at Windibank's in order to get his hands on McGilded's disk for some reason...)Judge: Counsel, you will commence your cross-examination, please.Cross-Examination - The Disk -Gina: Truth is, that brickmaker cove was in the cabin o' the omnibus the whole time.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: And you were hiding in the cabin at the time as well, weren't you, Miss Lestrade? If I remember rightly, in the storage compartment underneath one of the seats? Gina: Yeah, that's right. It's pitch-black under there, so ya can't see nuffin' at all. Pursue Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson (if not already pursued; before all statements have been pressed without pursuing) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Is there something you'd like to share with the court, Inspector Gregson and Mr Graydon? ......... Ryunosuke: INSPECTOR!!! MR GRAYDON!!! Gregson: WHA-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Blimey! You tryin' to give me a heart attack? Ryunosuke: You have been whispering to each other for quite some time now. Tell us, what is the discussion about? Gregson: Discussion? With this fella? Pull the other one, sunshine! You think I've got anythin' to talk about with a shady gent like this? Graydon: And I have nothing to say to this uncouth detective after he deprived me of that disk that was rightfully mine. Ryunosuke: (But they've clearly been talking the entire time I've been cross-examining Gina. It's as if they've been negotiating.) Van Zieks: ......... Judge: You will kindly refrain from talking amongst yourselves while the witness is giving testimony. Gregson: Yes, um...sorry, My Lord. Ryunosuke: (What WERE those two talking about?) Judge: Miss Lestrade, continue with your testimony, please. Gina: .........

Ryunosuke: (But they've clearly been talking the entire time I've been cross-examining Gina. It's as if they've been negotiating.) Van Zieks: ......... Leads to: \"Thank you, Miss Lestrade.\" Judge: Now, in your testimony two months ago... ...I feel certain that you claimed Mr McGilded was the sole passenger, did you not? Van Zieks: False testimony, My Lord. Gina: That's...that's wot 'e told me I 'ad to say. Ryunosuke: But it's important that you tell us the truth now. Were Mr McGilded and the victim acquaintances? Gina: I dunno. But I did 'ear 'em talkin' a lot. Ryunosuke: What were they talking about? Gina: Well I couldn't 'ear too well. But if I 'ad to say... ...I think it was about money or somefin'. They kept talkin' about 'buyin'' and 'not buyin''. Judge: Hm, perhaps business dealings of some kind... Gina: Well anyway, they got louder an' louder. It started to sound like a proper fight. I was pretty scared by then. I 'ardly dared to breathe. And then, all of a sudden... ...I 'eard a noise like someone keelin' over on the floor. It was bloomin' loud an' all. Judge: And I believe you let out an involuntary scream? Gina: Yeah. That's wot gave me away.Gina: When the Irishman dragged me out from under the seat, I saw that disk on the floor.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Was the disk you saw this disk? Gina: Yeah...I reckon it probably was. It was right next to the cove lyin' on the floor.

Leads to: \"Thank you, Miss Lestrade.\" Judge: Could this disk have belonged to the victim perhaps? Gina: I dunno, but McGilded picked it up pretty smartish. An' then 'e sat the cove wiv the knife in 'is belly up on the seat. Ryunosuke: What did he say to you at that time? Gina: 'E told me not to say a word about wot I'd seen or 'eard to no one. About the disk an' all. I was dead scared. The way 'e was lookin' at me, I thought... ...if I didn't go along wiv it, I'd get stuck wiv that knife, too. Judge: Hmmm... Gina: Then 'e started askin' me a load o' questions. Like wot me name was an' where I lived an' that. 'E asked me about bein' a diver, too. Ryunosuke: But after a while, what had happened in the carriage was noticed? Gina: Yeah, that's right. First there was a kind of rappin' noise.Gina: All of a sudden, I 'eard a scream from over me 'ead, an' that pair on the roof deck went off to call the slops.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: There were two gentlemen occupying the seats on the roof deck, I believe? Gina: That's right. They must've looked down through the skylight an' noticed the cove wiv the knife in 'is guts. When they screamed, the driver pulled up the 'orses an' McGilded got me out o' sight.

Leads to: \"Thank you, Miss Lestrade.\" Judge: Out of sight? Where? Gina: Back under the seat where I started off. Once the carriage came to an 'alt, the two coves from the roof ran off to fetch the slops. Van Zieks: If they immediately left to fetch the police, it would appear they were entirely unrelated to the incident. Judge: Hmmm... Ryunosuke: So that left McGilded, the driver and you still at the scene. Gina: Yeah. Only the driver didn't know I was there cos I was under the seat. I 'eard the cabin door open, an' a voice from outside. Judge: The driver, yes... He also testified in the trial, I believe. A fellow who went by the name of Beppo, if memory serves. Ryunosuke: What did McGilded and the driver say to each other? Gina: 'I dunno wot 'appened,' an' stuff like that mainly.Gina: That's when McGilded slipped the driver some tin to do a run to the pawn shop round about.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That pawn shop obviously being Windibank's on Baker Street. Judge: Ju-Just a moment, Counsel! Do, do you mean to tell me... ...that the driver gave false testimony in that trial as well?! Van Zieks: Perhaps the excursion to the pawnbrokery slipped his mind when he was in the stand. Judge: Indeed, Lord van Zieks! Gina: McGilded took off 'is coat an' gave it to the driver. 'E folded it up, all careful like, before 'andin' it over. When I saw 'im do that, I remember thinkin'... ...that coat an' wot's in it 'as gotta be worth a few bob.

I remember her quibbling with him over the price that afternoon at the pawnbrokery.) Gina: The driver looked pretty 'appy when McGilded flashed some brass in 'is face. 'E went runnin' off at a lick. Then the bogtrotter called to me and told me to come out from the drag's cabin.Gina: ...He threatened me not to snitch. Not to say nuffin' to no one about wot I'd seen or 'eard.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Threatened you how exactly? Gina: Told me I'd only be able to scarper if I did exactly wot 'e said.

Leads to: \"Thank you, Miss Lestrade.\" Van Zieks: Which included giving false testimony in court two months ago? Gina: Yeah, that's it. And there was one other thing 'e said. Van Zieks: Which was? Gina: 'E told me I'd 'ave to 'ang on to the ticket from the pawn shop. An' make sure not to lose it. Judge: The ticket...? Well I never! Gina: Said that if 'e didn't show up to get the ticket off me before two months passed... ...I 'ad to go to the pawn shop and pay the money to keep it in lug. To stop it bein' forfeited. 'E left me wiv some brass to pay for it. Judge: But really... ...why on earth would Mr McGilded have done such a thing? Depositing his overcoat with a pawnbroker before the arrival of the police... It makes no sense at all. Ryunosuke: There would seem to be only one logical explanation, My Lord. What McGilded had the driver deposit at Windibank's was something he didn't want the police to see. Something very important, that he needed to hide at all costs. Judge: ...! Gina: Anyway...after that, 'e let me go. So I legged it before the coppers showed up.Before pursuing Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson Ryunosuke: (Well done, Gina. It can't have been easy to tell the truth like that.) Iris: Ginny's really put her faith in you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Yes, and to thank her, she'll have to face a charge of perjury once this trial's over. (So I need to use the time we have now to get as much information out of her as possible.) Iris: It's time to really go for it! Press her on every statement! Ryunosuke: I, I suppose I should... Iris: Oh! And another thing... Ryunosuke: What's that? Iris: Take a look at those two. Isn't it strange that they've been whispering to each other the entire time? Ryunosuke: (Yes, that is strange. It looks like they're having a secret discussion about something... I'm not sure if I'm completely comfortable with that. I wonder if there's anything I can do about it...)After pursuing Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson Ryunosuke: (Well done, Gina. It can't have been easy to tell the truth like that.) Iris: Ginny's really put her faith in you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Yes, and to thank her, she'll have to face a charge of perjury once this trial's over. (So I need to use the time we have now to get as much information out of her as possible.) Iris: It's time to really go for it! Press her on every statement!After pressing all statements (without pursuing) and pursuing Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson:Judge: Thank you, Miss Lestrade. Thank you, Counsel. I've heard enough. I believe we now have a reasonable understanding of what actually transpired on the omnibus.Van Zieks: It would appear on that night two months ago, a negotiation was taking place on the omnibus. A negotiation concerning this disk. However, matters did not run smoothly. When the parties involved began to quarrel over price, McGilded took what he wanted by force... ...at the expense of the other man's life.Ryunosuke: Which proves my point! The disk is clearly extremely valuable in some way! (Although I don't understand why as yet.)Van Zieks: And two days ago, precisely two months after the omnibus incident... ...McGilded's coat and its contents were due to be forfeited.Gina: I didn't know wot I should do wiv the ticket. I mean, the cove died right after 'is trial. I knew that.Van Zieks: So you decided you would try to claim the articles as your own.Gina: Well why not, eh? They were only gonna be forfeited! Why shouldn't I 'ave got 'em? Anyway, ya can't blame me for thinkin' about it. Thinkin' ain't no crime!Judge: Miss Lestrade, it would appear Mr McGilded was prepared to kill in order to take possession of this disk. Do you know why that would be?Gina: Eh? I ain't got a clue! But I reckon it must be worth a fair bit o' brass. 'E was probably gonna sell it. An' ya can't blame me for thinkin' that! Thinkin' ain't no crime!Judge: Hmmm...???:My Lord!Bailiff:The evidence Your Lordship requested has been located and is ready for the court's inspection, sir!Ryunosuke: (The mysterious little box, deposited by McGilded two months ago... There's no doubt in my mind that it's a key piece in this far-reaching puzzle!)To be continued...Judge: So this is the article in question, is it? The 'small box' deposited with the pawnbroker by Mr McGilded two months ago.Ryunosuke: ...And on the night of Mr Windibank's murder... ...the only item on the shelves that was touched by whoever broke in to the shop.Iris: Quick, quick! Let's open it and see what's inside!Judge: Good gracious! This is no ordinary box, it seems!Ryunosuke: (Wow! ...Although in truth, I had an inkling that might be the case.)Van Zieks: ...It would appear that the box houses a miniature music box movement.Graydon: .........Judge: Then...is it too much to expect...?Van Zieks: I think it would be reasonable to assume that it is a device for the playback of this disk, My Lord.Judge: So, here we have the means to play back Mr McGilded's disk, deposited at Windibank's at much the same time.Van Zieks: Not strictly correct, My Lord. It was not McGilded's disk. It was the disk of his victim in the omnibus.Judge: But why, for heaven's sake? Are we to understand that the brickmaker was trying to sell this music box disk to Mr McGilded?Ryunosuke: ......... I believe the answer will become clear if we listen to the music on the disk, My Lord.Judge: Yes, very well. Let the court now listen to this curious disk at last.Gregson:Gregson: Wait! ...My Lord!Judge: Good grief! What is the meaning of this, Inspector?Gregson: The music box and the disk are, um... Well they're unrelated to the case! No, no need to spoil the sombre atmosphere in the courtroom with some silly bit o' music...Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: This disk may very well have motivated the culprit in this case to commit murder! Clearly there's every chance that it's fundamentally important to understanding what happened!Van Zieks: The prosecution has no objection.Gregson: But, but no! That piece of evidence is police property now! You can't-Van Zieks: Clearly Scotland Yard has some vested interest here. But it is policy of this prosecutor to leave no avenues unexplored. And you, Inspector, have no jurisdiction here to prevent that from happening.Gregson: GA-AAAAAAAARGH!Judge: No further delays, please. Play the disk!...........................Judge: Wh-What on earth...? That's certainly not what I would call music.Ryunosuke: (No... It's just the same note playing over and over again in an irregular sequence...)Judge: Hmmm...Graydon: Ha ha ha ha ha...Judge: Mr Graydon?Graydon: This, this really is priceless! After all that, the music box is broken!Ryunosuke: Broken?! (It, it can't be, can it?)Graydon: Well obviously! In fact, I wouldn't be surprised... ...if the officer sent to fetch it didn't drop it on the way back to the courtroom.Judge: Well, with much regret... ...I feel the court must accept that this music box offers little in the way of clues.Van Zieks: .........Judge: Are you ready to move on, Counsel?Ryunosuke: (Come on...! Yes, alright, it does sound as though it's completely broken, but...is it?) Could this 'music' emanating from the music box possibly be a new clue?No way Ryunosuke: I agree that it doesn't appear to be relevant, My Lord. Graydon: ......... Ryunosuke: ...What prompted that triumphant wiggle? Graydon: Nothing in particular. Ryunosuke: Really?! Or was it because that 'music' is in fact a very significant clue?! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: You never learn, do you? When you speak, you must mean what you say. ...Or be prepared to suffer the consequences! Ryunosuke: Ugh... Judge: Erm... Am I to understand that you do indeed consider this repetitive monotone to be relevant somehow?  Leads to: \"It's an abomination, Counsel! Mere noise!\"It could be a clue Ryunosuke: I believe that it could be relevant, My Lord. Judge: Good Lord! But, but how can it be? Leads to: \"It's an abomination, Counsel! Mere noise!\"Judge: It's an abomination, Counsel! Mere noise! I fail to see how it can have any meaning whatsoever.Ryunosuke: (It does sound strange, I agree. But there's one thing bothering me... While Graydon stands there chortling victoriously... ...the inspector beside him has a rather telling expression on his face. It's as if Gregson recognises the sound. As if he's familiar with it somehow... And that's making him appear extremely on edge.)Van Zieks: If that's the stance of the defence, my Nipponese friend, answer me this...Ryunosuke: Oh!...........................Van Zieks: Just what relevance do you propose this woeful chiming has on this case?Ryunosuke: ......... It's the defence's belief that the sound emanating from this music box is...Broken Ryunosuke: Clearly the music box is broken in some way! Van Zieks: ......... Graydon: ......... Judge: Counsel... ...I feel you are perhaps floundering in your non-native tongue, but 'broken' is tantamount to irrelevant here. Van Zieks: Indeed. And here's to your own irrelevant noise, my learned friend! Ryunosuke: Naaargh! (The music, or whatever you want to call it, has to be relevant somehow. ...Which might actually be the point!) Van Zieks: Let's see if you grasp the question better next time around... Leads back to: \"...........................\"An unusual genre of music Ryunosuke: It could be an unusual genre of music that none of us are familiar with! Van Zieks: ......... Graydon: ......... Judge: Counsel... ...would you care to elaborate on that remark? Ryunosuke: Well, it...it could be a new style of music that's about to take the world by storm, for example! Judge: I think not, Counsel. Such monotonous nonsense could be pleasing to no one's ear, surely. Van Zieks: Well said, My Lord. And here's to my learned friend seeing that remark's true meaning! Ryunosuke: Naaargh! (The music, or whatever you want to call it, has to be relevant somehow. ...Which might actually be the point!) Van Zieks: Let's see if you grasp the question better next time around... Leads back to: \"...........................\"Not supposed to be music Leads to: \"Just because this is a music box, it doesn't necessarily mean the sounds we're hearing are music.\"Ryunosuke: Just because this is a music box, it doesn't necessarily mean the sounds we're hearing are music.Graydon: ...!Ryunosuke: (Look at that. The smile vanished from Graydon's lips as soon as I said it. I'm on the right lines here. I must be!)Iris: Hehe, making deductions based on how people react to what you say... You're acting just like Hurley, Runo!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: The sounds we're hearing aren't necessarily music? Well, now that you've told us what they are not... ...I'm sure the court would like to hear what they are. Do enlighten us, my Nipponese friend.Ryunosuke: ...! Well, um...Van Zieks: Surely you have an idea in mind? Because if not... ...it will be the death of your ill-formed argument!Graydon: Exactly. The music box is clearly broken. Refusing to accept that fact is pure foolishness!Ryunosuke: (They've got me! I don't know what the answer is...yet!)Iris: Um, Runo... ...I've just examined the music box very thoroughly... ...and I'm fairly certain that it's not broken at all.Ryunosuke: Really?!Iris: Really. The way it's been made, it can only produce a single note anyway.Ryunosuke: Thank you, Iris!(Alright, well if the music box isn't broken... ...it must mean that the sounds it's producing have some significance that isn't musical. ......... Ah! Could it be...? Is that what these sounds are?!)Iris: Something's just struck me, Runo. I feel like recently - in the past few hours even... ...I've heard another sound very much like the one this music box makes.Ryunosuke: ......... (Yes, it's a familiar sound.) Actually, Iris... ...I was just thinking exactly the same thing.Judge: I'm going to have to press the defence for an answer. If your assertion is that the sound produced by this music box is not in fact music at all... ...then what the devil is it, Counsel?Ryunosuke: (All the evidence we've seen so far... All the testimony we've heard... It's all pointing to one single answer now!)Van Zieks: The prosecution demands that my learned Nipponese friend presents proof now! Tangible proof of this latest, wild speculation!Ryunosuke: ......... Alright then. (This could be the best chance I'm going to get to fight back in this trial. And if I'm right, it's going to join all the dots together!) The evidence that explains the true nature of the sounds on this music box disk is...Present Today's Paper (after examining picture on back) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Today's paper, Counsel?\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Obviously it's this! Judge: I'm afraid to say, Counsel... ...that you were being rather optimistic with that leading 'obviously' there. Ryunosuke: ......... If I'm honest, as I thumped my hands down just now... ...I had an inkling that it was going to hurt me more than the bench. Van Zieks: Well. At least one of your 'inklings' was correct, then. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Iris: That arrhythmic tinging sound the music box makes is definitely familiar somehow. Ryunosuke: It's almost like some sort of code... The question is how to show that the tinging sound has a connection to this case. (Perhaps I should have a good look through all the evidence in the Court Record again.) Iris: I'm going to have a good look through the Court Record again too, I think! Leads back to: \"The evidence that explains the true nature of the sounds on this music box disk is...\"Judge: Today's paper, Counsel? The headline is 'Pawnbroker Perishes in Pickpurse Plunder!' ...Hardly supportive of your cause.Ryunosuke: Ah...no, My Lord. I was hoping you'd look a little further down the page...Judge: Further down? 'Ministry Mole? Classified Secrets May Have Been Leaked Overseas From Ministry of Justice'... Yes, this is a very serious matter, being investigated at the highest level, I understand.Van Zieks: I have heard that international transmissions along supposedly secure lines are somehow being intercepted... ...and leaked to various other countries.Ryunosuke: And presumably...those transmissions are in the form of wired telegrams?Van Zieks: Of course.Ryunosuke: Juror number five! Your input, please!Juror No. 5: ......... Stop. Oh! M-Me, sir? Whatever is the matter?Ryunosuke: You told the court before that you worked at the same communication station as Mr Graydon, did you not?Juror No. 5: Y-Yes, that's correct.Ryunosuke: And the particular station where you work... ...deals with government communications and newspaper reports?Juror No. 5: Oh, yes! We're not your run-of-the-mill communication station at all. Our work is extremely important.Ryunosuke: Then tell me...is this not a very familiar sound?Juror No. 5: Hm...? ......... You, you don't mean to say...? Is it...?Ryunosuke: That's right, madam. It bears more than a passing resemblance to the sound made by your telegraph machine as you tap it. I believe it's called...Morse code?Juror No. 5: But... I don't believe it!Ryunosuke: Now correct me if I'm wrong...but when it comes to leaking telegrams from government departments... ...there could be nobody more perfectly placed than a highly skilled communications officer!Van Zieks: Are, are you suggesting that the music box disk... ...contains stolen government secrets in Morse code?!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar! Please, everyone! Ordaaar!!! But this... This is... This is high treason, Counsel! Deserving of capital punishment!Juror No. 6: Too much new wocabulary! What is this 'treason'? And what is 'capital punishment'?Ryunosuke: (The sorts of words I'd half expect you to know...)Judge: For our sovereign government's confidential information, hostile nations would surely pay almost any price!Ryunosuke: Yes...and on that night two months ago... ...that was the very negotiation that was taking place inside the omnibus!Van Zieks: But in the end, McGilded perished, and the all-important disk lay unclaimed in the pawnbrokery...Judge: My word!Ryunosuke: In which case... ...whoever stole that information in the first place must surely have been beside himself with worry. Because if the disk were to be discovered before it found its way out of the country...Judge: ...It would reveal an act of high treason punishable by death!Ryunosuke: So the culprit had no choice but to retrieve it. And in order to do that... ...he would have to gain entry to the pawnbrokery illegally in the middle of the night. Because the article left behind by Mr McGilded would incriminate him too much if it got into the wrong hands. Isn't that right...Mr Graydon?!Graydon: ......... You, you think I've been stealing government secrets? Preposterous! Absolutely preposterous!Judge: So, in response to the defence's accusation... ...you claim complete innocence, do you?Graydon: Well of course I do! I've had to stand here in silence while that pretentious foreign lawyer has been prattling away!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Then by all means...counter the charges, sir!Graydon: ...!Van Zieks: The prosecution demands the witness testifies...in response to the accusations brought by the defence!Graydon: ......... ...Delighted, I'm sure.Judge: The witness is reminded that the crime under scrutiny in this trial is the murder of the pawnbroker, Mr Windibank. That being a most flagitious offence, for which the law of this land sanctions a capital punishment. But the heinous act of high treason is no less serious a crime. ...I urge you to bear that in mind as you testify, Mr Graydon.Graydon: .........Judge: So then, let us proceed. You may-???:Nash: Ya gotta let us 'ave a rabbit an' pork 'ere, guvnor! We got things to say!Judge: I, I beg your pardon? Who do you think you are?Nash: Name's Nash Skulkin! Occupation is...profeshnal baddie.Ringo: Name's Ringo Skulkin! But we ain't baddies enough to sell out our muvverland!Nash: That's right. We're wot they call......the Three Skulkin Bruvvers! .........Gregson: Bad timin', fellas! Very bad timin'.Witness Testimony - Graydon's Counter -Graydon: A mere communications officer couldn't possibly steal confidential government information! Besides, the sounds produced by that music box aren't even Morse code! It was some low-class brickmaker negotiating with McGilded anyway, was it not? I've no relation to the man!Nash: Look, all we dun is break into the gaff the other night like wot 'e told us to do!Ringo: If we'd known there woz dodgy gov'ment secrets involved, we wouldn't 'ave touched it!Ryunosuke: .........Van Zieks: .........Judge: ......... Erm...Mr and Mr Skulkin...Nash: One mister'll do, guvnor. ...Wot's up?Judge: Do I take it that you now admit to the crime? That on the night in question, you did indeed gain entry to the premises illegally? And moreover...you did so as a party of three, in collaboration with Mr Graydon here?Nash: .........WE DID, GUV, WE DID!!!Judge: Quieten down, please. ...What say you to that, Mr Graydon?Graydon: ...I have no idea what these two ruffians are referring to.Nash: You little rotter, gettin' us mixed up in all this monkey business! You never said nuffin' about no gov'ment secrets! It woz s'posed to be a straight-up job!Ringo: An' wot about the geezer whose shop it woz, eh? Poor old bloke didn't 'ave to die, did 'e?!Graydon: Agh...!Ryunosuke: (Nice to know who your friends are...)Graydon: Whatever these men say, I deny the accusations.Judge: Indeed... Well, I certainly wasn't expecting this little music box to become so significant in the proceedings. However, as it has, I will admit it into the Court Record as evidence.The small music box has been entered into the Court Record.Examine evidence Small Music Box Mechanism in top compartment Ryunosuke: This is the mechanism that turns the bumps on the disk into sound...isn't it? Iris: Yes, the 'movement'. It's all thanks to the comb with its teeth that are plucked by the passing bumps. Usually, the teeth on the comb are different lengths so that each one produces a different tone. But this comb is very strange. All the teeth are exactly the same length. Ryunosuke: Well...what does that mean? Iris: It means that no matter which tooth is plucked by the passing bumps, the music box will make the same sound. I've never seen a music box like it before. Ryunosuke: Yes, it is strange. A music box that can only play a single note... (There has to be some significance to that, surely.) Music box disk Ryunosuke: See how the 'For McGilded' disk sits in the music box the man deposited at Windibank's. It couldn't be a more perfect fit. Iris: So there's no question then! The disk was designed to be played in this music box. Ryunosuke: Yet despite that, the sounds it produces are neither musical, nor do they appear to have any meaning. (It just doesn't make any sense...) Iris: I wonder... ...if perhaps there's more to this music box than meets the eye. Maybe we haven't discovered all its secrets yet. Knob on bottom Ryunosuke: ...Oh! Iris: What is it, Runo? Ryunosuke: I've, I've just noticed something about this music box... It looks like the bottom of it opens up as well. Iris: Ah! You're right! Well come on then! What are you waiting for? Let's open it! Ryunosuke: Alright then...here goes... Iris: Look at that! There's another movement on the underside! Ryunosuke: So...does that mean... ...you can set another disk to play back on this side? Iris: Yes, I think so. And it looks like the two movements are linked together. Ryunosuke: They're linked? Iris: So if you had two disks, they would both play back at the same time. Bottom compartment (after examining knob on bottom) Ryunosuke: Who'd have thought there would be a second movement on the underside of the box? Iris: And this movement is like the other one. The comb's teeth are all the same length. Ryunosuke: So...this movement also only produces a single tone, like the other one? Iris: Yes, it must do. Except that the length of the teeth on the two combs isn't the same. So the single tone produced by this movement will be different to the single tone we've already heard. Ryunosuke: What? Iris: Basically, each movement can only produce a single note... Ryunosuke: ...but the notes they produce are different. (A music box that can only play two tones...)Cross-Examination - Graydon's Counter -Graydon: While these ruffians were jostling with the broker, I was still near the entrance to the shop.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Mr Windibank emerged from the storeroom, I believe? Graydon: Ringo and Nash were scouring the counter when he suddenly appeared and flew at them. He already had the revolver in his hand. ...Fortunately, I wasn't too close. Nash: I've never been so scared in all me life! Ringo: Yeah, we're just yer regular, mild-mannered burglars, that's all. We dun't like violence. Ryunosuke: ...Says the pair who carry a gun. What do you mean when you say you were 'near the entrance to the shop'? Graydon: I was in the doorway, running my eyes over the shelves of forfeited items. Ryunosuke: (Looking for the music box, of course.) Graydon: The broker went for Nash in the first place. Then Ringo joined in, making it two against one. So I assumed they could handle the situation. But I was wrong. Ringo: I woz tryin' to 'elp me little bruv, but the old geezer chucked me over the bloomin' counter! Nash: So I pulled me gun on the old fella, an' that soon made 'im scarper. Judge: The pair of you setting upon the poor, defenceless pawnbroker together? Shame on you! Sorry, guv...Graydon: When Windibank threw Nash over the counter, I felt a sharp pain in my arm.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You mean that's the moment you were shot? Graydon: Yes. Though I didn't immediately realise what had happened, of course. Things crashed to the floor from the counter as the three men were brawling. It was at exactly that moment that it happened. So I didn't hear the gunshot. Ryunosuke: And the bullet went on to strike the calendar in the wall behind you... Graydon: So it would appear. When I looked at my arm, I saw it was bleeding badly. So I wrapped my handkerchief around it. Seeing as I couldn't explain what had happened to a doctor, I had no choice but to wait for it to heal. I didn't imagine it would still be bleeding two days later. Van Zieks: Did Mr Windibank intend to shoot you, do you think? Graydon: Well now...I don't imagine he even noticed I was there, to be honest. Perhaps the gun went off accidentally. Anyway, it didn't quite strike home. Nash: When I pulled me gun on 'im, 'e tried to shove me out the way. Ringo: And then 'e scarpered fru that door out back. Judge: At which point, what did you do?Graydon: I pursued the man but he shut himself in the storeroom. I could see him through the peephole in the door, though.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You mean you chased after him? Graydon: I don't recall the reason why. But I ran after him to the back of the shop. Ryunosuke: And what about this 'peephole in the door' you mentioned? Gregson: Well, unsurprisingly, the storeroom door's a solid job. Made of stout wood. But there's a small openin' in it about head height that lets you see what's what in there from the outside. Ryunosuke: (Actually, I should know that, shouldn't I? I looked through it myself that night.) Van Zieks: And what about you burgling brothers? Did you see what went on through this peephole as well? N-N-Not likely, guv! D-Didn't see nuffin' o' the sort, guv! Graydon: I doubt these two buffoons were even aware of the peephole's existence. Ryunosuke: (So the Skulkin brothers were there, but they didn't see the killing of Mr Windibank take place.) Judge: Hm... Graydon: Inside the storeroom, I could see the broker and that young girl standing there. Judge: The defendant? Graydon: Yes. Though neither of them noticed that I was looking. The girl raised her gun and pointed it straight at the man. Judge: And then...? What did you see next?Graydon: The accused, in a black coat, shot the man in the back as he was trying to flee to safety!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Yes, when the crime was discovered, the defendant was found with a gun in her hand. But that was Mr Windibank's gun, from which only a single bullet had been fired. And as we've clearly established, Mr Graydon, that bullet was fired at you! Graydon: Ah, but no... It wasn't the broker's gun that the pickpocket girl had when I saw her. Yes, the bullet from Windibank's gun grazed my arm... And yes, the Skulkins' gun grounded the detective... But this...was another gun entirely. A third gun. Van Zieks: The broker's gun was not the murder weapon. So clearly there had to be a third firearm involved. In other words, the accused must have had her own gun with her at the time. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But no other gun was found at the scene! Graydon: Ha ha ha ha ha... Calm yourself, Counsel. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Graydon: You must consider the events in order. Ryunosuke: ...! Graydon: At first I saw the broker and the girl glaring at each other, but then, all of a sudden... ...the broker turned to run. And it was at that moment, that the little gutter rat shot him in the back! Judge: ...A chilling image, I must say. Graydon: .........Graydon: I saw the blood spatter all over that wretched girl.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: All, all over her? Graydon: Yes, through the peephole, I saw it clearly. Of course, the stains are invisible now, what with the coat being such a dark colour. But I assure you...that garment is sullied with the victim's blood! Ryunosuke: (Well...it is sullied with blood, that's for sure.) Iris: But it's not Mr Windibank's blood, is it? Ryunosuke: No, that's right. It's Mr Mason Milverton's blood from when McGilded stabbed him two months ago. Iris: It's so annoying! If they'd only accept Hurley's chemical analysis, we could prove that. Ryunosuke: But they won't. So unfortunately, we can't use it as evidence to support our case. Iris: Bother...Graydon: Then she tossed the gun out of the peephole. So I picked it up...and made my escape.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Did, did I hear you correctly? She threw the gun out of the room? Graydon: That's right. After the broker fell to the floor, she started walking over. Judge: Over where exactly? Graydon: In the direction of the storeroom door. To where I was watching. Of course, I quickly retreated. And then... ...the girl dropped the gun through the peephole onto the floor on my side of the door. Judge: But why on earth would she do such a thing? Graydon: ...I couldn't tell you. Perhaps she was hoping to distance herself from the murder weapon. Without thinking, I went and picked it up. I suppose I was worried about just leaving it there, in case any more tragedies took place. Van Zieks: ......... So it was you, in fact, who took the third gun from the scene of the crime? Graydon: Yes...it was yours truly. Judge: Hm... Graydon: I left the clear-up to my lackeys and left. Ryunosuke: Clear-up? Nash: We'd made a bit of a mess around the counter, so Mr Whistle 'n' Flute 'ere told us to tidy up. Ringo: 'E thinks 'e's our bloomin' mum sometimes! Graydon: Well I was paying you enough, by God! Nash: Ugh... Ryunosuke: Tell me, Mr Graydon, when you left the pawnbrokery that night... ...was it by any chance with the second disk in your jacket pocket? Graydon: ......... You're like a bull at a gate, aren't you? But I admit to nothing of the sort. After all, you can't even show the court such a disk exists...can you? Pursue Tobias Gregson or Nash Skulkin Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Gentlemen! Nash: Hahh...hahh...hah...hahh... Hahh! Gregson: Somethin' wrong, sunshine? Ryunosuke: That should be my line. You...do realise you were just violently shaking Mr Skulkin? Nash: Blimey, this dee's a bit of an 'ooligan, ain't 'e? Ryunosuke: What was going on just now? Nash: You saw 'im! 'E grabbed me whistle! 'Why the blazes,' 'e said, 'didn't ya mention the third gun when we got ya down the station?' Ryunosuke: And why didn't you? Nash: Cos! We didn't know nuffin' about it! Or that flamin' peephole in the door! Gregson: Um...sorry about that. I can be prone to losin' my rag sometimes. ...Not hurt, are you? Nash: Gor blimey, see the way 'e's lookin' at me? I'm tellin' ya, this dee gives me the willies! Ryunosuke: (That was strange... The inspector doesn't normally get quite as worked up as that. He wouldn't normally grab someone...) Iris: No, that wasn't like Gregsy at all. He's normally all sweetness and light, no matter what I say to him. Ryunosuke: Yes, well... I think you might be a special case, Iris. Iris: Well anyway. That was definitely out of character. Gregson: ......... Leads back to cross-examination Ryunosuke: (As expected... ...he won't admit to anything unless I can thrust the evidence in his face.) Graydon: Ha ha ha ha ha... It's not as easy as you thought, is it? To pin a crime on this lapel. Ryunosuke: ...! Graydon: Ha ha... It won't stick. Not murder...not treason... Ryunosuke: (Maybe not right now, but you won't be sniggering like that forever!)Iris: What's your feeling, Runo?Ryunosuke: As much as I hate to admit it...I don't see any obvious holes in his testimony at the moment.Iris: But you have to find a way to break this man!Ryunosuke: (And quickly, too. Because once they discover the blood on the overcoat Gina was wearing...)Iris: It's a bit strange that he's so sure of himself about seeing the blood spatter over Ginny's coat. It doesn't strike me as the sort of thing you'd claim if you hadn't genuinely seen it happen.Ryunosuke: But we know that Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank. So what's going on...?Iris: All I know is that it's very unfair! Why should some German scientist's test be acceptable as evidence when mine and Hurley's wasn't? Detectives can use test tubes, too!Ryunosuke: (Never mind that. I have to find a really stark inconsistency in this testimony somewhere. And I have to find it before the prosecution discovers the bloodstain on Gina's coat!)After pressing first, second, third, fourth, and fifth statements and pursuing Tobias Gregson or Nash Skulkin correctly:???:My Lord!Bailiff: Requesting Your Lordship's permission to interrupt the cross-examination!Judge: Explain yourself, Officer!Bailiff: I have the results of the test that was ordered earlier, My Lord!Van Zieks: Ah...the blood... On the accused's overcoat.Judge: Thank you, Officer. Very well, the cross-examination is hereby temporarily suspended. I presume you have no objection, Counsel?Ryunosuke: Um... No, My Lord.Gregson: ......... Well, there you have it!Van Zieks: The report, please, Inspector.Gregson: Yes, sir! 'Traces of human blood were found on the overcoat of the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade. From the extent of the stains, it would appear that they were the result of spattering following a gunshot wound.' ...End of report!Judge: Goodness me!Graydon: ...See? What did I tell you?Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: No! The blood on that coat is not Mr Windibank's!Judge: What on earth makes you say that, Counsel?Ryunosuke: The coat originally belonged to Magnus McGilded. Just before his coat was deposited at Windibank's, McGilded had fatally stabbed Mr Mason Milverton. So the blood on that overcoat...is the blood of the brickmaker from the omnibus case!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Well...the dead cannot speak. ...Isn't that right, my Nipponese friend?Ryunosuke: Sorry?Van Zieks: Two months ago in this very courtroom... ...did you not argue fervently for McGilded's innocence? And yet now that the man is dead...you brand him as a murderer? Your conduct shatters any shred of respect you may have earnt for yourself in this country!Ryunosuke: Agh! But, but that was...Juror No. 1: I call it a bally disgrace! Treachery, that's what it is!Juror No. 3: Hm, how to determine whether the blood on that coat is two months old or not...? Even a stereoscope couldn't help the answer to that problem pop out. It can't be done!Ryunosuke: But...but... ...we used Mr Sholmes's specially formulated chemicals-Juror No. 4: Mr Sholmes is a detective, not a chemist!Juror No. 5: Would you put such faith in a chemical formula devised by me, for example, when I'm a communications officer?Juror No. 6: I held out pirozhki to starving boy, and he ran away crying.Van Zieks: Herlock Sholmes is barely more than a figment of the public's imagination. His name carries no weight in this courtroom! ...No weight at all.Ryunosuke: How could you say that?!Graydon: ...Victory is sweet indeed. This proves that my testimony is the whole truth from start to finish!Judge: How do you arrive at such a conclusion, sir?Van Zieks: As the witness said, the accused's coat was spattered with the blood of the victim. The only way Mr Graydon could possibly have known that fact, is if he saw it happen. In other words...his testimony is solid, and the conclusion is singular: It was the accused who shot the victim in this case. That...is the whole truth!Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAARGH!???:My Lord!Juror No. 1: Been a long battle, this one, but this old warhorse has something to say now, if you please.Judge: Mr Foreman...?Juror No. 1: As of this moment, sir, the squadron has reached its final decision. Ready, men? All for one now!SIR!Juror No. 1: Guilty!Juror No. 2: Guilty!Juror No. 3: Guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Guilty!Judge: Well, it would appear the ladies and gentlemen of the jury have reached a unanimous verdict.Van Zieks: The defence has consistently failed to unpick this witness's testimony. Here's to any attempt you may make at unpicking the jurors' decisions being...equally successful.Ryunosuke: Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH! (I don't believe it... After I've come so far... How is it all unravelling on me so fast...?) .........???:How very distressing... ...to be held in such low esteem.Bailiff: Wouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo?Judge: Officer...? You've delivered the report now. That will be all, thank you.Bailiff: It occurs to me with some regularity, Mr Naruhodo... ...that scientific truths are determined not by science... ...but by none other than the human mind.Ryunosuke: (I, I know that voice...) Am I going mad...? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr Sholmes!Judge: Wha...? WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!Van Zieks: What business do you have here, detective? The last I heard, you were recuperating in hospital.Sholmes: As well I would be...had I not been set upon an errand.Van Zieks: What errand?Iris: Hurley! It's really you! You're awake at last!Sholmes: Yes, good day, Iris. I appear to be rather late to rise. My apologies. Now, My Lord...if you will humour me?Judge: In what manner, sir?Sholmes: I have something of great importance I wish to give to the young lawyer over there. I need no more than five minutes. Would you be so kind as to spare us the time?Judge: Hmmm... What say you to this, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: ......... This trial has taken many hours of the court's time. Having spent so long already-Gregson: Exactly! Havin' spent so long already, we don't wanna go wastin' any more precious time!Van Zieks: As I was saying... Having spent so long already, it would seem churlish to deny the defence a mere five minutes.Gregson: EEEEEEEEEHHH?!Judge: Very well then. Counsel, you have five minutes.Sholmes: My dear fellow, I apologise for my tardy arrival.Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! Are you alright now?Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Alright? I'm all wrong!Ryunosuke: Sorry?Sholmes: I've only just managed to summon the strength to stand, man! I asked the judge for five minutes... ...but I fear even that may prove too much for me. Pray forgive me should I pass out.Ryunosuke: Um...let's make this discussion as short as possible.Iris: Hurley, this place is full of idiots! None of them can see how wonderful your chemical blood analysis is!Sholmes: Ah well...that concoction of mine was really just a bit of sport to assist me in my investigations. I never took the trouble to refine it for appraisal by the scientific community. ...An oversight on my part.Ryunosuke: Right... (Modesty? Surely not...)Sholmes: But enough of that. I'm here to give you this, my dear fellow.Ryunosuke: What's that? (A lavender furoshiki wrapping...?)Sholmes: A leaving present. From Miss Susato.Ryunosuke: From Miss Susato?Sholmes: If possible, matters were to be settled without me giving you this. Those were her instructions when she asked me to do her this favour.Ryunosuke: I...I don't understand.Sholmes: Miss Susato foresaw today's events, I believe. She knew that the culprit would attempt to escape justice by means both devious and underhand. And that you, Mr Naruhodo, fighting fairly as you are wont to do, would find yourself in considerable peril. At that very moment of crisis, you were to be given this small parcel. Those were the dear lady's instructions.Ryunosuke: (A leaving present from Susato-san... Whatever could it be?) What is this?Iris: Oh! It's...it's the machine I made!Ryunosuke: Ah!Wagahai: Miaow.Iris: Look! I used this! It's my latest invention!Ryunosuke: What...what is that?Iris: I call it...the Cat-Flapomat! It can make a cat flap for a little furry friend like Waggy in seconds!Iris: What's Susie up to?Sholmes: Miss Susato muttered the following words before she left: 'I'm a failure. I don't deserve to be a judicial assistant.'Ryunosuke: What? (Didn't she say something like that...?)Ryunosuke: You really are the best judicial assistant in the world.Susato: Well...that's extremely flattering. But I'm sorry to say... ...that I've been a complete failure.Ryunosuke: Whatever did she mean by that, Mr Sholmes?Sholmes: ......... That night, when you left Windibank's in pursuit of the thieves... ...Miss Susato made use of this contraption for...a certain purpose. That is your answer, dear fellow.Ryunosuke: (Not, not at all cryptic then... Susato-san used this Cat-Flapomat that night? But why?)The Cat-Flapomat has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: ...Your five minutes...is over.Examine evidence Cat-Flapomat Grip or trigger Ryunosuke: Whew! Those vicious teeth look like they could rip through almost anything! Iris: They're good, aren't they? They're made of a special alloy I developed just for this job. The cutter rotates ten times per second so it can get through any kind of door in no time at all! Ryunosuke: And...what are the two parts at the top there? Iris: Ah, those are for attaching hinges to the section of door that gets cut out. Ryunosuke: Right. Of course. Iris: Nothing can match this machine for power! It can make mincemeat of even the toughest of doors! Ryunosuke: ......... It sounds so charming and friendly when you say what it's for, but... ...it feels like the reality of the Cat-Flapomat is that it's a grim weapon of door destruction. Iris: Wagahai's so adorable, there's nothing I wouldn't do for him! Even developing deadly weapons!Ryunosuke: ...! (We're out of time already?)Sholmes: I'm grateful to you for affording us that brief recess, Mr Reaper.Van Zieks: I need no thanks, detective. After all... ...the die is cast.Sholmes: ...Is it really?Van Zieks: The jurors are unanimous in their leanings. No doubt my learned friend will consider a summation examination... ...but any attempt to alter the verdict now would be utterly futile.Sholmes: ......... I wonder... Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Yes?Sholmes: The rest is down to you, dear fellow. What is your plan?Ryunosuke: (The rest is down to me...? I need to be careful here. If I make a wrong move, the trial will end...badly.) My Lord! The defence requests...A summation examination Ryunosuke: (Now it's come to this, my only chance is to appeal to the jurors and try to change their minds.) Sholmes: What do you think you're doing, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: What of Miss Susato's gracious gesture? Would you let this final piece of evidence she left you go to waste? Ryunosuke: Final piece of...? Sholmes: This is not a time for inaction. This is a time to hear from a witness! Ryunosuke: But, but it's not possible for me to bring a new witness to the stand at this point! Iris: I don't think that's what Hurley means, Runo. Ryunosuke: ...! Iris: Have you forgotten where we are in the trial? Ryunosuke: ......... (Ah-ha!) Judge: If the defence has nothing more to add, I think we should proceed to the adjudication. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Wait, My Lord! The defence requests... Leads to: \"...further cross-examination.\"Further cross-examination Leads to: \"...further cross-examination.\"Time to think Ryunosuke: (It's no good... I need time to think...) Sholmes: What do you think you're doing, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: What of Miss Susato's gracious gesture? Would you let this final piece of evidence she left you go to waste? Ryunosuke: Final piece of...? Sholmes: This is not a time for inaction. This is a time to hear from a witness! Ryunosuke: But, but it's not possible for me to bring a new witness to the stand at this point! Iris: I don't think that's what Hurley means, Runo. Ryunosuke: ...! Iris: Have you forgotten where we are in the trial? Ryunosuke: ......... (Ah-ha!) Judge: If the defence has nothing more to add, I think we should proceed to the adjudication. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Wait, My Lord! The defence requests... Leads to: \"...further cross-examination.\"Ryunosuke: ...further cross-examination.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: The jurors have spoken! Protocol dictates that you may not cross-examine a new witness now.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: The defence is not asking for the cross-examination of a new witness. Rather to continue with one of an existing witness.Van Zieks: What?Sholmes: It would appear that a rather important detail has escaped your attention, Mr Reaper.???:My Lord!Bailiff: Requesting Your Lordship's permission to interrupt the cross-examination!Judge: Thank you, Officer. Very well, the cross-examination is hereby temporarily suspended. I presume you have no objection, Counsel?Ryunosuke: Um... No, My Lord.Iris: So nobody can say anything then! If Runo asks to resume his cross-examination of Mr Graydon...Sholmes: ...The court is obliged to allow it!Van Zieks: This...is absurd!Judge: ......... I would remind those present that this is my courtroom. I concur that the defence is entirely within its rights to request the continuation of the cross-examination. However, I will not permit an unremitting protraction of these proceedings. Therefore... ...I have decided to afford the defence one final opportunity in concluding the cross-examination.Ryunosuke: ...!Judge: Counsel, you must choose but one statement from the witness's testimony... ...and but one piece of evidence to present in support of your argument against it.Ryunosuke: (A single chance to present evidence...?)Judge: If, following that, the situation remains unchanged, I shall move to adjudication. Is that clear, Counsels? You will not press the witness any further!Van Zieks: My Lord.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Sholmes: Hm... A single statement and a single piece of evidence. ...Most generous. Well then, Mr Naruhodo. It's high time I...fell in a dead faint. I leave this...in your capable hands...*Thud!*Ryunosuke: Mis...MR SHOOOOOOOOOLMES!Judge: To stand so insouciantly before the court in a state of such high fever... Either the man has extraordinary strength of mind, or an extraordinary lack of feeling.Van Zieks: I imagine he's feeling very little now. The detective is sleeping soundly in one of the antechambers.Ryunosuke: (Strike a man when he's down, why don't you?)Judge: Well then, Counsel...are you fully prepared?Ryunosuke: ...Yes. (One statement... One piece of evidence... I won't let Mr Sholmes down. Or Iris. And I won't waste this final chance that Susato-san has given me. This is going to decide the entire outcome of the trial!)Judge: Very well, then. Under the terms I have outlined...you may resume the cross-examination!Cross-Examination - The Moment of the Shooting Again -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

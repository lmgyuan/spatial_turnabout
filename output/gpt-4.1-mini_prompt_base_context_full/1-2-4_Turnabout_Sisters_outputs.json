Brrrrring... *beep* ???: Hello? This is Maya. Mia: Hey Maya, it's me. ???: Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while. Mia: Sorry, I've been so busy. How you been? ???: Well, LONELY. And it's all YOUR fault. Nah, I'm just teasing. I've been great! I'm finally getting used to having my own place. Mia: That's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask. ???: I know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you? Mia: Sharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here. ???: I gotcha. So, what is it this time? Mia: It's... a clock. ???: A clock? Mia: Yeah, it's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys. ???: Hey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis! Mia: Now, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now. ???: Huh? It's not working? That's lame! Mia: I had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead. ???: Papers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes. Mia: Can you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then. ???: Okay, Sis, but I expect dinner! Something good! Like... burgers! I could really go for a good burger. Mia: Okay, okay. We'll hit the usual joint. ???: Alright! It's a deal! Okay, Sis, see you soon! Mia: Yep. I'll be waiting, Maya. Cellular: *beep* [Conversation recorded. September 5, 9:27 AM] September 5, 8:57 PMFey & Co. Law Offices ???: Now, Miss Fey, I'll take what's mine... the papers. Mia: I'm sorry, but I can't give you what I don't have. ???: Miss Fey, you are a poor liar. Why, I see it right over there... That must be \"The Thinker\" that swallowed those papers. Mia: How could you know...? ???: Ho hoh. You are not cogniferous of my background? Gathering information is my business, you see. Mia: I... I should have been more careful. ???: Ho hoh. My dear Miss Fey... I am so very sorry. But I am afraid I must ask you for one more thing. Your eternal silence... Farewell, Miss Fey. Mia: !!! Red... White... Blue... Episode 2Turnabout Sisters September 5, 9:08 PMFey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Uh oh, I'm late. Huh, that's strange. The chief must have gone home already. She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!) Examine Anywhere Phoenix: I smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay! Phoenix: That smell... Blood! ???: ... *sob* Sis... Phoenix: (Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...? Chief!!! Phoenix: Who are you? ???: ... Phoenix: (The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.) Phoenix: Chief... Examine Broken glass Phoenix: Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand. Chair Phoenix: The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too. Mia Fey's body Phoenix: Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. \"The Thinker\" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon. The Thinker added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room. Glass Shards added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be? Mia Fey's body (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly. \"Maya\" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices) Phoenix: ! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday. Receipt added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.) \"Maya\" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; after clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices) Phoenix: ! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday. (Wait a second! \"Maya\"...! Was Mia trying to tell us something about that girl? I think I'd better show her this receipt. I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom!) Receipt added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.) \"Maya\" scrap of paper (subsequent times; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices) Phoenix: ! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday. (I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.) \"Maya\" scrap of paper (subsequent times; after clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices) Phoenix: ! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday. (Wait a second! \"Maya\"...! Was Mia trying to tell us something about that girl? I think I'd better show her this receipt. I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom! I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.) \"The Thinker\" statue Phoenix: It's encrusted with dried blood. How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again. Window Phoenix: There's a large building right across from the office. The \"Gatewater Hotel.\" A nice, luxurious place. Bookshelf Phoenix: All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings. Computer Phoenix: Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing. Desk Phoenix: A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office d√©cor: \"Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple.\" Ledger book Phoenix: The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money. Corded phone Phoenix: Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart. ???: Police!? Please, come quick! Phoenix: (Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand... Corded phone (subsequent times) Phoenix: The phone receiver is missing a few screws. I'd better not use it. Fey & Co. Law Offices If Fey & Co. Law Offices is being visited for the first time, before Receipt is added to the Court Record Phoenix: ...! (That girl just now... where'd she go!? I put her right there on that sofa...! Uh oh... I hope she didn't run on me.) Yipes! (Don't scare me like that...) Umm... Excuse me but, who are you? ???: ... Phoenix: It's okay. I work here. Maya: Maya... Maya Fey. Phoenix: Maya... Fey? If Fey & Co. Law Offices is being visited for the first time, after Receipt is added to the Court Record Phoenix: ...! (That girl just now... where'd she go!? I put her right there on that sofa...! Uh oh... I hope she didn't run on me.) Yipes! (Don't scare me like that...) Umm... Excuse me but, who are you? ???: ... Phoenix: It's okay. I work here. Maya: Maya... Maya Fey. Phoenix: Maya... Fey? (\"Maya\"...? So Mia was writing this girl's name! Maybe I should show her the receipt? I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom!) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant. Door Phoenix: The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob. Painting Phoenix: A large painting. I guess you'd call this \"modern art.\" I, on the other hand, call it a mistake. Reception desk Phoenix: The reception desk. I usually sit here. Sofa Phoenix: This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model. Writing desk Phoenix: A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies. Talk What happened Phoenix: (She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened? Maya: ... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...! Phoenix: (So she was already dead.) You and the Chief Phoenix: So, you're the chief's...? Maya: Sister. I'm her younger sister. Phoenix: And you were here... visiting? This late at night? Maya: Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her. Phoenix: Evidence...? Maya: Yes... I-it was that clock... It was \"The Thinker.\" Present The Thinker Phoenix: Um, about \"The Thinker\"... Maya: ! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob* Phoenix: (Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...) Glass Shards Phoenix: This was lying next to the chief. Maya: I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand. Phoenix: Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...) Receipt (before examining corded phone in Office) Phoenix: Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt. Maya: ! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name? Phoenix: Please, just calm down. Maya: W-why would Sis write my name? Phoenix: (Uh-oh. Now I've done it... I'd better hurry up and call the police!) Receipt (after examining corded phone in Office) Phoenix: Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt. Maya: ! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name? Phoenix: Please, just calm down. Maya: W-why would Sis write my name? Phoenix: (Uh-oh. Now I've done it...) Anything else Maya: I'm sorry, I've never seen that before. After examining corded phone in Office and presenting Receipt in Fey & Co. Law Offices: *whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*... *whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*... Phoenix: ! The police! (Sounds like they're coming this way!) Freeze! Police! Gumshoe: Alright, I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, see? Phoenix: (Gumshoe...? What an odd name.) Gumshoe: We received a report from the building across the way, see. Got a person saying they saw a murder. Phoenix: (It must have been that woman I saw.) Gumshoe: Anyway, I don't want either of you moving one inch, 'kay? Phoenix: (Great. Just great. Maya... Wait, she wouldn't have... nah.) Gumshoe: Whoaaaaaaaaaaaah! Scuze me! Maya: Eek! Gumshoe: This word \"Maya\" here mean anything to you? Maya: ...! Um... that... That's my name... Gumshoe: WHAAAAT!? The victim drew this here note in her own blood, see? With her dying breath, she wrote down the killer's name! Maya: K-killer...? I'm not-- Gumshoe: Case closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am. Maya: W-what? Phoenix: Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible. September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.) Maya: Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning. Phoenix: Good morning! (She looks so tired...) Maya: Um... Are you going to be my attorney? Phoenix: Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about... It's up to you Phoenix: (I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you. Maya: Up... to me? Phoenix: Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here. Maya: ... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it! Leads to: \"Did I look at her like that?\" Of course I will Phoenix: (First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up! Maya: R-really...? Phoenix: (Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it? Maya: ... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it! Leads to: \"Did I look at her like that?\" Sorry, not a chance Phoenix: (Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding... Maya: ... ... ... Phoenix: (Eh heh. Whoops. That didn't go so well.) Maya: ...Heh... Phoenix: Huh? M-Maya...? Was that a... chuckle? Maya: What? N-no! ... It wasn't very believable, was it? Phoenix: (Not really...) Maya: I-I'm sorry! I just thought, since you'd made a joke... Please, don't mind me! You're doing just fine! Phoenix: (Who's trying to cheer up who here!?) Maya: ... I knew it. No one will believe me. Phoenix: What? Maya: Even you-- when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it! Leads to: \"Did I look at her like that?\" Phoenix: (Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought... Maya: I-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you. Phoenix: Heard...? Heard what about me? Maya: I... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day... Mia: \"Today was my junior partner's first time in court.\" Maya: Wow! Really? How'd that go? Mia: \"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while...\" Maya: Hah! So, he crashed and burned? Mia: \"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience.\" Maya: Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now! Mia: \"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty.\" Maya: That's what she said! Phoenix: ... Maya: I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you... Phoenix: No, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia... Maya: ... I know... Examine Security camera Phoenix: Smile for the camera... Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Talk Maya Phoenix: There's something I've been wanting to ask you... Maya: Yes? Phoenix: What's with that outfit? Maya: Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say. Phoenix: A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do? Maya: Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training. Phoenix: A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.) The day of the crime Phoenix: Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Maya: Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial. Phoenix: Evidence? Maya: Yes. That clock shaped like \"The Thinker.\" Phoenix: (The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case? Maya: Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice? Phoenix: H-her own voice!? Maya: Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone. Phoenix: You recorded it! Maya: Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things. The day of the crime (after clearing \"Your cell phone\" Talk option) Phoenix: Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard. Maya: No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial. Phoenix: (That's \"The Thinker\" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office? Maya: It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister... Phoenix: Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now. Your cell phone (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it! Maya: Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry. Phoenix: Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it. Maya: I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay? Phoenix: Sure, thanks. Maya's Memo added to the Court Record. Your cell phone (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it! Maya: Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry. Phoenix: Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it. Maya: I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay? Phoenix: Sure, thanks. Spirit mediums (appears after \"Maya\") Phoenix: So you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training. Maya: That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world. Phoenix: Wait a second, you said the \"Fey Family\"? So, Mia was into this stuff too? Maya: Of course! She left the mountain to \"follow her career,\" she said. Her powers were first-class, too! Phoenix: (I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...! Maya: What? Phoenix: So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that? Maya: Yes. ...In training. Phoenix: Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her! Maya: ...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level... Phoenix: (Hmm... I thought that would be too easy.) Present The Thinker Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about the murder weapon... Maya: Poor Sis... *sniff* Phoenix: (Hmm. Better not ask her about this now.) Glass Shards Phoenix: This was lying next to the chief's body... Maya: I saw that too. They said they thought these were pieces of a broken light stand. Phoenix: Yeah, that seems about right. (Though I'd never heard of a glass light stand before this...) Receipt Phoenix: Remember that receipt? Maya: Y-you mean the one with my name on it? Phoenix: Any idea why she... Maya: Absolutely none! Um... Do you trust me? I trust you Phoenix: I trust you. Maya: Why? Don't you think I did it, too? Phoenix: No, I don't. (It's just a hunch, but...) Maya: That detective thinks I did it. Phoenix: ... Leads back to Court Record I don't trust you Phoenix: ... Maya: I didn't think you'd believe me. You're just like the detective. Phoenix: I'm sorry... I don't like lying just to make people feel better. But it doesn't mean that I've decided you did it! (She seemed so lost at the crime scene.) Leads back to Court Record Maya's Memo Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about your cell phone... Maya: That detective took it when they brought me in. Phoenix: (So, Gumshoe took it... I'll have to try to get it back next time I see him...) Anything else Maya: Sorry... I've never seen that before. After clearing all Talk options: Maya: ... Um...! Phoenix: Huh? Something the matter? Maya: Um... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor? Phoenix: ...? Maya: This is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me? Phoenix: (Hmm...) Accept Phoenix: Sure, why not? I'll go ask. Maya: Thank you so much! I have no one else to turn to... Phoenix: ...? Say, what about your parents...? Maya: ... ... ... Phoenix: I... I see. Don't worry, leave it to me. Maya: Thank you! The trial's tomorrow... at 10:00. Phoenix: W-what!? Tomorrow!? Maya: Tomorrow. Phoenix: What if this guy refuses!? Leads to: \"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\" Refuse Phoenix: I'm sorry... I think this is the kind of thing you should really do yourself. Maya: ...You're right. ... Phoenix: Something wrong? Maya: Actually, I asked the police to contact him, and they tried calling a few times. Nobody could get a hold of him! Phoenix: They couldn't find him? Maya: I have no one left to ask! Phoenix: ...? Say, what about your parents...? Maya: ... ... ... Phoenix: O-okay! Don't worry, I'll go ask him for you. Maya: Y-you will? Thank you so much! Phoenix: I'm just worried what will happen if I can't find him. Leads to: \"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\" Maya: They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me. Phoenix: When will that happen? Maya: They're giving me until 4:00 this afternoon. Phoenix: (And visiting hours are almost up... I'd better hurry!) Right, I'll be back! September 6Fey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: (The office is filled with police officers. They're all busily searching for clues...) ???: Hey! You there! This is a crime scene, pal! No trespassing! Umm... Sorry, don't I know you from somewhere? Wait, you're that Butz guy, aren't you! Phoenix: No, no, Phoenix Wright. (How could anyone mistake me for Larry!?) ???: Ah, guess I got the wrong name, Mr. Wright. Sorry 'bout that. That Butz guy, he was a killer! And you're no killer! Right? Phoenix: (He WAS proven innocent...) Umm... right. And you were... Detective Gumshoe Phoenix: Um... Gumshoe, wasn't it? Dick Gumshoe? ???: Right! At your service. Hang on! That's Detective Gumshoe to you, pal! Leads to: \"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\" Detective Suedeshoes Phoenix: Um... Suedeshoes, wasn't it? ???: That's me! Don't step on my blue suede shoes... Wait! That's a song, pal! My name's Dick Gumshoe... W-wait! That's Detective Gumshoe to you, pal! Leads to: \"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\" Detective Gumtree Phoenix: Um... Gumtree, was it? Detective Gumtree? ???: G-Gumtree...? Gum doesn't grow on trees, pal! And I'm the one in charge here so don't push your luck! Phoenix: (Whatever you say, Detective...) Leads to: \"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\" Gumshoe: Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"... Police: Hey, Dick! Get over here! Gumshoe: Y-yes, sir! B-be right there! Umm... ahem! You're her lawyer, right, pal? If you got business here, you'd better do it quick! Phoenix: (Whew! He thinks I'm Maya's lawyer...!) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is that Mia probably read all of these. Houseplant Phoenix: Mia's favorite potted plant. I remember it had this bizarre name no one could ever remember. ???: \"Cordyline stricta,\" pal! Phoenix: (Who was that!?) Mia's desk Phoenix: Mia's desk. Perfectly clean, as always. The only thing it's missing is... Mia. Movie poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it. I'll have to check it out one of these days. Window Phoenix: The sky is blue, and so am I... There's that hotel, right across the way. Talk Mia Phoenix: About Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy? Gumshoe: Hmm? You want to know the results, eh? Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: Now don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all! Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Mia (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, Mia's death was instantaneous. Gumshoe: That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person. Phoenix: You knew her, Detective? Gumshoe: Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all. Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win! Phoenix: W-why do you say that? Gumshoe: The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution! Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) Gumshoe: I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all. Edgeworth (appears after \"Maya\") Phoenix: Prosecutor Edgeworth... Gumshoe: That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!? Of course I do! Phoenix: I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his \"guilty\" verdict. Gumshoe: Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case. Phoenix: (So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...) Leads to: \"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\" Of course not! Phoenix: Never heard of him. Gumshoe: Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him! Phoenix: (Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a \"guilty\" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...) Leads to: \"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\" Phoenix: (All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...) Present The Thinker Phoenix: I was wondering, do you know anything about this? Gumshoe: That statue? That's the murder weapon. Phoenix: (Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.) Glass Shards Phoenix: There was broken glass at the crime scene, right? Gumshoe: Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand. Receipt Phoenix: There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it! Phoenix: Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself? Gumshoe: Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not. Phoenix: (So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.) Maya's Memo Phoenix: I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone? Gumshoe: Oh that? I have that. Phoenix: Do you think you could give it back? Gumshoe: Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer! Phoenix: (Uh-oh, he's on to me!) Tell him straight Phoenix: (Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!) Gumshoe: Something the matter? Phoenix: Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective! Gumshoe: Nope. I know nothing, pal! Phoenix: That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets! Gumshoe: Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory! Phoenix: Impressive! You're quite the detective. Gumshoe: Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all. Leads to: \"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\" Tell him not-so-straight Phoenix: (Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?) Gumshoe: Something the matter? Phoenix: Oh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone... Gumshoe: This? Hmm... it says \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo\"... \"The Steel Samurai\"... that action hero on TV? Phoenix: Yeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct. Gumshoe: That what she said? Phoenix: Um. Yes. Gumshoe: ... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway. Here you go. Leads to: \"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\" Phoenix: (Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...) Maya's Cell Phone received from Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Received: Maya's Cell Phone.] in the original release) Check the Court Record to hear the recorded conversation. Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Thanks for this! Gumshoe: Don't mention it, pal. When it comes to dealing with lawyers, \"fight fair and square,\" is our motto! Phoenix: (I don't know how I feel, seeing everything written up like this... It makes Mia's death seem so... routine.) Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: (Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...) Anything else Gumshoe: Hmm? What's that? Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you! After clearing \"Mia\" and \"Maya\" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo: Phoenix: (I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.) Gumshoe: You all done, pal? Phoenix: Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now. Gumshoe: Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal! Phoenix: ... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness? Gumshoe: Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her! Phoenix: (Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then? Gumshoe: Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial! Phoenix: (So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information. Gumshoe: You got that right, pal! Phoenix: (Time to pay a visit to Miss May!) September 6Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: (According to the receptionist, the big boss is \"out\". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read. Desk Phoenix: A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster. Painting Phoenix: That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter. Potted plant Phoenix: An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available. Table Phoenix: A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn. Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303) Maya: Hey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer? Phoenix: Sorry. I haven't seen him yet. Maya: I see... Phoenix: (Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.) Talk Your family Phoenix: What about your family? Maya: I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is. Phoenix: (Don't know...? So she could still be alive?) Your mother (appears after \"Your family\") Maya: The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life. Phoenix: (\"Ruined\"...?) Maya: After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would \"become a lawyer\" and she left the mountain. Phoenix: ... So, you live by yourself? Maya: Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release) Phoenix: (I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...) Your mother's enemy (appears after \"Your mother\") Phoenix: So, who was this man who, um, \"ruined\" your mother? Maya: About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate... Phoenix: Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they? Maya: The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim. Phoenix: Wow... So, what happened? Maya: The case was solved... we thought. Phoenix: You \"thought\"...? Maya: The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent. Phoenix: ...! Maya: The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation. Phoenix: I see. Maya: ... White... Phoenix: Excuse me? White? Maya: That was his name. My sister told me. Phoenix: White? Hmm... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Hey, I got your cell phone back. Maya: Oh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice? Phoenix: ... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ... Maya: Thank you. September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303 April: Well! Hello there, handsome. Phoenix: Umm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.) April: You're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, \"Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!\" Tee hee! Phoenix: (Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.) April: Gee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness! Phoenix: (I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.) Examine Bed Phoenix: A simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here. Flowers Phoenix: The flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge. Open drawer Leads to: \"There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.\" Painting Phoenix: Ah. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be \"still life\"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall. Table Phoenix: A bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her. Window Phoenix: The late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though. Phoenix: (There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...) April: Hey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you? Phoenix: (Upset!? I thought she was going to explode for a second there! I wonder what could be inside the drawer?) Examine Open drawer Phoenix: (Hmm... what's inside I wonder?) April: *cough* *cough* Phoenix: (Maybe later...) Talk What you witnessed Phoenix: Do you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident. April: Ooh. \"Observe,\" \"incident\"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary. Phoenix: (Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please? April: Let me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer! Phoenix: (Oh boy.) Miss May Phoenix: Um, could you... just who exactly are you? April: Oooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me? Phoenix: N-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here! April: Tee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush. Phoenix: (Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do? April: Well... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you! Phoenix: (Oh boy.) This room Phoenix: I see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you? April: Oooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television! Phoenix: Oh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer! April: Say, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph! Phoenix: (Oh boy.) Present Anything April: Excuse me, but I'm a witness? Police witness? You understand? How could I possibly give you any information in good conscience, hmm? Me... \"the witness\"! It's just like the movie! Grossberg Law Offices (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303) Phoenix: (Hmm... seems like Mr. Grossberg is out. Well, maybe I should just wait here for him to come back.) ???: *Ah-HHHHEM!* Phoenix: (If that wasn't the most over-the-top clearing of the throat I've ever heard!) Grossberg: Ah hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me? Phoenix: Uh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!) Grossberg: Hmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now? Phoenix: Y-yes, well... yes. Grossberg: And what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed! Phoenix: (Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?) Grossberg: Hmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it! Phoenix: Um... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey. Grossberg: ...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on. Phoenix: (Hmm? Why the strange reaction?) Grossberg: A-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible. Phoenix: W-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!? Grossberg: Urk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion. Phoenix: (What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him! What do I tell Maya...?) Talk Your refusal Phoenix: How can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case! Grossberg: Hmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see! Phoenix: But the client is Mia Fey's sister! Grossberg: Hmm... ahem. Phoenix: Mia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands. Grossberg: Yes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye. Phoenix: Creep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere. Grossberg: *grumble*... Think not. Phoenix: Huh? Did you say something? Grossberg: I think not, I said. Phoenix: Wh-what do you mean? Grossberg: I'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy. Phoenix: Why!? Grossberg: I... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you. Phoenix: (What's going on here!?) Mia Phoenix: How did you know Mia Fey...? Grossberg: ... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see. Phoenix: A \"mission\"? Grossberg: You could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one. That painting Phoenix: That's... quite a painting. Grossberg: Ahah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you! Phoenix: (I wasn't interested...) Grossberg: It's not for sale! Phoenix: I'm not buying! (Geez!) Present Anything Grossberg: Very sorry, but I've got nothing to say regarding this matter. Fey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: ... (Looks like Detective Gumshoe has gone home. The police are still keeping themselves busy in the chief's office. No one has time to talk to me. Guess I'll head out.) Examine Houseplant Phoenix: Mia's favorite potted plant. I guess I'll have to water it now... Detention Center (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303, then visitng Grossberg Law Offices) Phoenix: Hmm... Maya's not here. She must be in questioning. They probably won't let her out for a while. Maybe I'd better go talk to that lawyer again. After clearing all Talk options in Grossberg Law Offices: September 6, 3:42 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Hiya. Maya: Oh! You're back! Did you find the lawyer? Phoenix: Um... well... (What do I tell her?) Well, see... (Just be honest!) I... I really don't think you should use that guy. He... didn't seem healthy. He was all skin and bones! Maya: ... What really happened? Phoenix: ... Maya: You don't mean... He refused to help? Phoenix: Urp. Maya: ... I see. I've been abandoned, then. After clearing \"Your mother's enemy\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, if all Talk options have been cleared in Grossberg Law Offices Leads to: \"Just a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess...\" Maya: Just a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess... Phoenix: ... (4:00 PM. Time's up. What should I do? Do I just leave her and go home...?) Go home Phoenix: (There's nothing left here for me to do... She'll be better off with a state-appointed lawyer.) I think I'd better get home now. Maya: Good-bye. Phoenix: It was a few days later when I found out how the story ended. The result of the trial was in the newspaper. \"Guilty.\" I'll probably never meet her again. Did I make the right choice? Will I ever know? Mia... if you can hear me, please, tell me! ... Phoenix: Not! I can't let that happen! I'm not leaving here until she takes me as her lawyer! Leads to: \"I've made up my mind!\" Defend Maya Leads to: \"I've made up my mind!\" Phoenix: I've made up my mind! I'm going to defend you whether you want me to or not! Maya: ! Why? Phoenix: Why? Well... I can't abandon you Phoenix: ... (No one is as sad as a person without any friends. I know... I've been there. A long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) Maya... Leads to: \"I won't abandon you. You can count on me.\" Someone else is the culprit Phoenix: You aren't the culprit! Someone else is! Maya: H-how do you know? Phoenix: I, um, I have a hunch... (Given the evidence, it would be easy to assume that Maya was the killer. But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) Maya... Leads to: \"I won't abandon you. You can count on me.\" I don't know why Phoenix: To be honest, I don't know. Maya: You don't know? Phoenix: (Is this girl sitting in front of me the killer? All the evidence seems to say \"yes.\" But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) There's only one thing I know for certain. Leads to: \"I won't abandon you. You can count on me.\" Phoenix: I won't abandon you. You can count on me. Maya: ... That's so kind of you... *sniff*... ... Phoenix: Well! Let's fight this one and get you out of here! Maya: R-right! Thank you! Phoenix: (Whew, she smiled at last. She looks like an entirely different person!) One last question... You are innocent, right? Maya: Yes! And I trust you... So you trust me, too, okay? Phoenix: It's a deal. (So, what next... There's something that's been bugging me... Just what was inside that strange woman's drawer? It was when I tried to look into the drawer that she got all defensive. There has to be something in there!) Gatewater Hotel Bellboy: Good afternoon, sir! Phoenix: Excuse me, you are...? Bellboy: Ah, I beg your pardon, sir! I am the bellboy of this establishment, at your service, sir. Phoenix: Oh, right. Bellboy: I've just come up to deliver room service, sir. Phoenix: Um... do you know where Miss May might be? Bellboy: Ah. I believe our guest Miss May is currently using the, er, facilities...? If you've no need of anything, I'll be taking my leave. Please, stay as long as you like. Enjoy... Phoenix: Yeah... Wait... no! Hey! ... (Why does it seem like every time I come here, I end up embarrassing myself? Wait... now's my chance to snoop around a bit!) Bellboy: Ah, I almost forgot! Phoenix: Gah! Y-you came back quick! Bellboy: Might I ask you to inform Miss May that there is a message for her? Please tell her that Mr. White, of Bluecorp phoned. Phoenix: Oh, right. Sure. (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? Where have I heard that name?) Maya: White... That was his name. My sister told me. Phoenix: (\"White\" was the name of the guy who ruined Mia and Maya's mother! Could it be a coincidence?) Examine Open drawer Leads to: \"There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer.\" Phoenix: There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer. Now's my chance to see what's inside! ...! What do we have here! A... wiretap? Hmm! What would a woman like her be doing with a thing like this? Wiretap added to the Court Record. Phoenix: There is definitely something suspicious about this \"Miss May\"! Why would she have something like this in her hotel room? There's a story behind all this, I know it! Alright... I'll be using this bit of evidence in tomorrow's trial, that's for sure. For Maya's sake... I'll get to this woman's bottom! Wait... I mean ... you know what I mean. April: Oh, bellboy...? Still there? Phoenix: (Uh oh, time to scram! I look forward to tangoing with you tomorrow, Miss May! In court!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Turnabout Sisters Transcript Transcript (JP) Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 September 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1 Judge: The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey. Edgeworth: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement. Edgeworth: Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor. Judge: I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then. Edgeworth: If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe! Edgeworth: Witness, please state your name and profession to the court. Gumshoe: Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder. Gumshoe: Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here. Edgeworth: And the cause of death? Gumshoe: Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of \"The Thinker\" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir! Judge: The court accepts the statue as evidence. Phoenix: (They're still calling it a \"statue\"...) Floor Plans added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Now, Detective... Gumshoe: Y-yes sir! Edgeworth: You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why? Gumshoe: Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir! Judge: Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this \"hard evidence.\" Witness Testimony -- Maya Fey's Arrest -- Gumshoe: As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene! There were two people there already: The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright. I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey! Why? We had a witness account describing her! The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder! Judge: Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination. Phoenix: Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...) ...whoosh...SMACK! Phoenix: (Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!\" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!) Judge: Something the matter? Phoenix: No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Maya Fey's Arrest -- Gumshoe: As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who did you say you got a call from? Gumshoe: Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene! Phoenix: (Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue. Gumshoe: There were two people there already: Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime? Gumshoe: Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes! Phoenix: Th-that's pretty fast! Gumshoe: Our motto this month is \"quick response\"! That's how I got there before the killer got away! Edgeworth: Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were. Gumshoe: Yes sir! Gumshoe: The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely sure it was us? Gumshoe: Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene! Phoenix: (Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...) Gumshoe: I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why's that? What's your reason? Gumshoe: Why? We had a witness account describing her! Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold on just one second!\" Gumshoe: The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder! Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold on just one second!\" Phoenix: (I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!) Phoenix: Hold on just one second! Gumshoe: Y-yeah? Phoenix: If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had \"hard evidence\" she did it, correct? Gumshoe: Huh? Did... did I say that? Me? Phoenix: I heard you say it! Judge: You did say it. Edgeworth: You said it. Phoenix: Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was \"hard evidence\"!? Gumshoe: Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink... Judge: That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective? Gumshoe: Umm... Phoenix: (Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!) Gumshoe: ... Yes. Phoenix: (Gah!) Gumshoe: Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor! Judge: Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again. Witness Testimony -- Hard Evidence -- Gumshoe: After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes. I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body! On it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood! Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's! Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger! Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name! How you like that? That's my \"hard evidence\"! Judge: Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective. Gumshoe: Y-Your Honor? Judge: Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!? Gumshoe: Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir. Judge: Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Hard Evidence -- Gumshoe: After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And did you find any evidence? Gumshoe: Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part! Phoenix: (I got a bad feeling about this...) Gumshoe: I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it! Gumshoe: Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants? Phoenix: Wh-who? Um... The killer Phoenix: Th-the killer! Anyone can see that! Gumshoe: Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please! Phoenix: She was framed! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence? Phoenix: Ah... (Urk!) Edgeworth: Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright. Gumshoe: Yeah, pal! Phoenix: (Argh...!) Leads to: \"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\" Miss May Phoenix: Well... it could have been the witness, Miss May! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright! Gumshoe: Yeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal! Phoenix: (Argh...!) Leads to: \"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\" I did Phoenix: It... it could have been me! Gumshoe: What! S-so it was you! Phoenix: No, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note? Phoenix: Uh... Edgeworth: Listen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur! Phoenix: (...!) Leads to: \"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\" Edgeworth: Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found. Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: On it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!? Gumshoe: Of course I do, pal! Phoenix: (Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident. This might not be good...) Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What kind of \"tests\" were these again? Gumshoe: Huh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests! Judge: Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony. Gumshoe: Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir. Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Y-yeah? Edgeworth: I think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check. Gumshoe: Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Phoenix: (That was a mess...) Gumshoe: Right! Where was I? Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: On which hand was the bloody finger, Detective? Gumshoe: The right hand! Phoenix: (Hmm... she WAS right handed...) Gumshoe: Hah hah hah! Nice try! Phoenix: (Uh oh... I guess it wasn't too hard to see what I was getting at there.) Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name? Gumshoe: Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies! Phoenix: This isn't a movie, Detective. Gumshoe: Oof! Phoenix: Let's talk about reality, shall we? Gumshoe: Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no. Phoenix: Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister? Gumshoe: Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer! Judge: Order! Order! Phoenix: (That didn't go so well...) Gumshoe: Th-that's right! What he said! Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Phoenix: (That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!) Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying? Gumshoe: Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!? Phoenix: You have it backwards, Detective. Gumshoe: B-backwards? Phoenix: The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. \"Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object.\" She died immediately! Gumshoe: But...! Phoenix: No \"but\"-ing your way out of this one, Detective! Judge: Order! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report? Phoenix: Wh-when...!? The day of the murder Phoenix: I... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder. Gumshoe: You're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after! Phoenix: Oh. Right. Leads to: \"The prosecution's point being...?\" The day after the murder Phoenix: It was the day after the murder... Leads to: \"The prosecution's point being...?\" I forget Phoenix: I'm... sorry, I forgot. Edgeworth: Hah! Forgot, you say? Gumshoe: It was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally! Phoenix: Oh. R-right. Leads to: \"The prosecution's point being...?\" Judge: The prosecution's point being...? Edgeworth: That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor. Phoenix: Wh-what!? Edgeworth: A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! \"Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow.\" I received these results this morning. Phoenix: N-no way! Edgeworth: Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write \"Maya\"! That is all. Judge: I see! Phoenix: (Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!) Edgeworth: Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say? You're a sham, Edgeworth! Phoenix: Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report? Judge: Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution! Edgeworth: No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable. Leads to: \"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\" The detective's a sham! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!? Gumshoe: Huh? I-I thought... Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Urp! Edgeworth: I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that. Gumshoe: Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir. Edgeworth: You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month. Gumshoe: W-what? B-but... *sigh* Leads to: \"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\" I'm a sham! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe. Are you calling me a fool because I believed your report? Gumshoe: Huh? Me? I-I'm not... huh? Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Urp! Edgeworth: I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that. Gumshoe: Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir. Edgeworth: You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month. Gumshoe: W-what? B-but... *sigh* Leads to: \"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\" Edgeworth: Your Honor, I submit this report to the court. Judge: U-understood. The court accepts the evidence. Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record. Edgeworth: Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer. Judge: I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes. Phoenix: (Darn! This isn't good!) Edgeworth: The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes! Judge: Let the witness Miss April May take the stand. Phoenix: (Exactly what part of her is \"innocent\"...?) Edgeworth: Witness, your name, please. April: April May! At your service! *wink* Judge: Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking! ([wanton] misspelled as [wonton] in the original release) April: Aww... Yes, Your Honor. Phoenix: (This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!) Edgeworth: Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred? April: Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch. Edgeworth: And this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices? April: Mmm... that's right, big boy. Judge: Please testify to the court about what you saw. Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- April: It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know! And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked! The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair! Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away! But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her! Then the woman with long hair... She kinda... slumped. The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink* Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: Well, Your Honor? Judge: I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any... Phoenix: W-wait, Your Honor! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: What about my cross-examination!? Judge: I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you? Edgeworth: Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies... Phoenix: H-hey! How dare you! Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness? Yes, I'm doing it Phoenix: I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!) Leads to: \"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!\" No thanks Phoenix: No... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point. Edgeworth: Heh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case! Phoenix: (Wh-what? That's it!?) Judge: Very well. Phoenix: W-wait! Hold on! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness? Phoenix: Yes yes yes! (I'd better, or I'll lose on the spot!) Leads to: \"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!\" Judge: Very well, you may begin your cross-examination! Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- April: It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why did you do that? April: Huh? \"Why\"? Like, why what? Phoenix: Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something? April: Oh, well, um... gee! Phoenix: (What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!) April: I sort of, y'know. I had a feeling! Phoenix: (Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question! Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?) Go for it Phoenix: (Let's see how far I can run with this...) Surely, you must have had a reason to look out your window at that time of night! April: I... oooh! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness! Phoenix: B-badgering? Edgeworth: You insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed. (Yeah! Yeah! Stop him!) (The poor girl!) Judge: Order! Mr. Wright, you have been warned. Phoenix: (Poor girl!? What about poor me!?) Leads to: \"You looked out the window. What did you see next?\" Back down Phoenix: (If I go too deep, I might not come back out alive... I'll back off for now.) Leads to: \"You looked out the window. What did you see next?\" Edgeworth: You looked out the window. What did you see next? April: And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The woman with long hair... that was Mia Fey? April: Um-hmm! Slender, sort of, well, some people might say pretty, if that's your thing. Phoenix: (Your... thing?) Edgeworth: And the person attacking her? April: The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How do you know she was the defendant? April: Huh? Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay? Edgeworth: There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor. Phoenix: (He's right...) Yep, he's right Phoenix: (Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.) Edgeworth: So then, tell us what happened to the victim. Leads back to cross-examination I question the testimony Leads to: \"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!\" April: Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She \"dodged\"? Dodged what!? April: Well... the attack! Edgeworth: Please, continue your testimony. April: But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How did you know it was my client!? April: Huh? Well, I... gee! First of all, she had a girl's physique! And, and secondly, she was... she was small! Who else could it be but her! Phoenix: (She has a point...) You're right Phoenix: (Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one. Maybe I should just listen to the testimony again.) Leads back to cross-examination I question your testimony Leads to: \"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!\" Phoenix: (Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!) Phoenix: Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks! April: W-what!? Phoenix: Miss May, I'm willing to bet that... You saw nothing Phoenix: Did you really see the defendant at all!? Leads to: \"Urp!\" You're lying Phoenix: Are you telling the truth? Did you really see the defendant!? Leads to: \"Urp!\" April: Urp! Judge: Mr. Wright! What's the meaning of this? April: Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean! Phoenix: Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique! April: ...! Phoenix: No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus! April: But... but! Judge: Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder... Phoenix: She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May? April: Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling. Judge: Miss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony. April: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink* Judge: Your testimony again, if you would. Phoenix: (Damn, I almost had her!) Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- April: I did see everything! I did! The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right. Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her... And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did! That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think? Well? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee! Judge: I... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- April: I did see everything! I did! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you saw me then, too? April: Of course! I'd remember that spiky hair anywhere! Phoenix: (Spiky...?) Judge: The witness will refrain from personal attacks on the defense attorney. April: Aww, was I a bad girl? I'm sowwy. Judge: Very well... continue. April: The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is that \"right\" as in your right, as you looked from the hotel? April: Um... which hand do I hold my knife in again...? Right! It was my right hand! Right? Edgeworth: Satisfied, Mr. Wright? Please continue. April: Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How convenient for you to remember her \"hippie\" clothes! April: That's what you--I mean, that's what she was wearing! Oh, and her hair was all done up like a bun! Phoenix: (*sigh*...) Judge: What happened then? April: And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where did this weapon come from? April: She picked it up from the desk! Judge: I see. What sort of weapon was it? April: That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A... clock? (Didn't this come up in another testimony recently...?) April: W-well? Don't look so sour, Mr. Lawyer. You can't win them all. Phoenix: (No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!) Present The Thinker Phoenix: Leads to: \"Miss May.\" Phoenix: (Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.) Phoenix: Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing. April: Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer... Phoenix: You just said that this statue of \"The Thinker\" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it! April: Urp! Phoenix: Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a \"clock,\" too... And he was found guilty... of murder! Judge: Order! Order! Phoenix: Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock? April: Oooh... urp! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns! Judge: Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...) Judge: ... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness. Phoenix: (Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!) April: Huh? What? So... what happens now? Phoenix: What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock? April: What...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time! Phoenix: So, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.! April: N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee! Edgeworth: The law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock! Judge: Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied? Phoenix: No, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because... She couldn't have heard it Phoenix: You were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You have proof that she could not? Phoenix: Uh... Edgeworth: Amateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing. Phoenix: Then I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard... Edgeworth: The prosecution denies your request! Phoenix: Wh-what!? On what grounds? Edgeworth: This is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand! Judge: Indeed. Objection sustained. Phoenix: (Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!) Judge: Ready to proceed, Mr. Wright? Leads back to: \"No, Your Honor!\" It couldn't have rung Leads to: \"Your Honor, members of the court...\" Phoenix: Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang! It's empty Phoenix: That clock is missing its clockwork! Judge: H-how could you possibly...? Phoenix: Just have a look... Right now! (Changed from [Just have a look... As soon as you can!] in the original release) Judge: ... Oh! Phoenix: See anything interesting, Your Honor? Judge: It is as the defense says! Leads to: \"This clock is missing its clockwork!\" It's broken Phoenix: I-I think it's broken! That clock's busted! Judge: You \"think\"? Phoenix: J-just look at it! Your Honor, please examine the clock! Judge: Hmm... Oh! Phoenix: See anything interesting, Your Honor? Judge: Well, I'm not sure I would call this \"broken,\" but I doubt it could ring...! Leads to: \"This clock is missing its clockwork!\" The batteries are dead Phoenix: The batteries on that clock must be dead! Judge: \"Must be,\" Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Your Honor, if you would inspect the clock...! Judge: Hmm... very well. ... Oh! Phoenix: Well, Your Honor? Are they...? Judge: This clock has graver problems than dead batteries! Leads to: \"This clock is missing its clockwork!\" Judge: This clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this? Phoenix: It is as you can see. The \"clock\" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar! April: F-fat!? Phoenix: Well, Miss May? Edgeworth: Tsk tsk. Phoenix: ? Edgeworth: Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!) Edgeworth: I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction! Judge: ! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it. Edgeworth: And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor! Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed? Edgeworth: Ho hoh! Impossible, of course... Phoenix: I have proof. Edgeworth: W-what!? Phoenix: Wasn't it you who told me \"proof is everything\"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the \"proof\" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Leads to: \"Take a look at this!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you say to that? April: W-what? I don't rightly understand what that's supposed to mean! Judge: I don't rightly understand either. Edgeworth: Ho hoh! Phoenix: (Uh oh... I think I blew it.) Judge: Mr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future. Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor! Leads back to: \"The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...\" Phoenix: Take a look at this! Judge: Hmm. That's a very cute cell phone. April: Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone! Phoenix: W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder! Judge: Order! Order! Edgeworth: The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention! Phoenix: Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it? Edgeworth: *grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...) Phoenix: (I gotta say, I'm starting to feel bad for the big fella.) (Changed from [My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.] in the original release) Let's hear the conversation. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [So you just want me to hold on to \"The Thinker\" for you, then?] Mia: [If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.] Maya: [Huh? It's not working? That's lame!] Mia: [I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.] ...[September 5, 9:27 AM] Cellular: *beep* Phoenix: Your Honor, I think this makes it clear the clockwork was already gone by the time this was recorded, (Changed from [I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone...] in the original release) which was well before the witness even arrived at her hotel! (Changed from [and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!] in the original release) April: Muh... muh... muh!? Phoenix: Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!? April: ... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink* Judge: So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright? Yes Leads to: \"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\" No Phoenix: Oh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!) Judge: Then, the court would like-- Phoenix: Hold on! P-please wait, Your Honor! Judge: Y-yes...? So you do have an objection? Phoenix: Um, yes, well... Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Sorry, Your Honor, it's just... Leads to: \"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\" Phoenix: The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\" But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court! Judge: Well then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before. Present The Thinker Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's simple.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here is undeniable proof! Edgeworth: Hah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece! Judge: Hmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind? Leads back to: \"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.\" Phoenix: It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever! April: W-whaaat!? Phoenix: A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody! April: I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores! Phoenix: Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...? April: Mmpf... Phoenix: Oh? Excuses not on sale today? April: Oooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die! Judge: W-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm! April: Hrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink* Phoenix: (S-scary...) Judge: Miss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock? April: ... Judge: Hmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior? Phoenix: (Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because... You held it Phoenix: (This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands! Judge: Mr. Wright! When was this!? Phoenix: When she used it to strike the victim! When else? Judge: Order! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!? Phoenix: April May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made \"The Thinker\" ring! That's when you heard it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: W-what's that supposed to mean!? Edgeworth: It was you who just proved that \"The Thinker\" was empty! Phoenix: Oh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!) Edgeworth: What's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder. Phoenix: (S-she can't prove it! She did it!) April: It would be MY pleasure! Phoenix: N-no way! April: Yes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy! Edgeworth: Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid! Judge: Mr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman! Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know \"The Thinker\" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof! Judge: Well... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock? Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Phoenix: The defendant's cell phone. Judge: Yes, we've seen that already. Phoenix: Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.] Mia: [Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.] Maya: [Again? What's it this time?] Mia: [It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!] ... Judge: They do mention \"The Thinker.\" But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation? Present Wiretap Phoenix: Leads to: \"Have a look at this.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!) Judge: Mr. Wright! Your evidence, please! Leads back to: \"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\" Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!? April: I... I... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is ridiculous! Phoenix: Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer. April: La... laaa... lrrrrgf! Judge: Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone? April: ... Judge: Miss May! April: Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER! ...... April: I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!) You did it, didn't you? Phoenix: Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you? April: Are you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Why the wiretap? Phoenix: Miss May... Why did you tap her phone? April: ... Phoenix: Answer the question! April: Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant? Phoenix: (Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that \"irrelevant\"! Judge: While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone? April: At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Present Wiretap Phoenix: Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not? April: Oooh. Oooooh! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is irrelevant! Judge: I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap. Edgeworth: This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone? Phoenix: Absolutely! Edgeworth: Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT! Phoenix: Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple! Edgeworth: WHAAAAT!? Phoenix: Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Leads to: \"I present the defendant's cell phone.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This! I think... Judge: That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think... Phoenix: W-wait! That was just a warm up! Judge: Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time! Leads back to: \"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\" Phoenix: I present the defendant's cell phone. Judge: Yes, we've seen that. Phoenix: Listen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.] Mia: [Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.] Maya: [Again? What's it this time?] Mia: [It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!] ... Phoenix: Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!? April: I... I... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is ridiculous! Phoenix: Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer. April: La... laaa... lrrrrgf! Judge: Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone? April: ... Judge: Miss May! April: Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER! ...... April: I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!) You did it, didn't you? Phoenix: Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you? April: Are you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Why the wiretap? Phoenix: Miss May... Why did you tap her phone? April: ... Phoenix: Answer the question! April: Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant? Phoenix: (Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that \"irrelevant\"! Judge: While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone? April: At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence reveals the truth of the matter! Judge: What does it reveal, exactly? Edgeworth: The mad delusions of the defense, perhaps? Phoenix: (Uh oh, bad reaction. Maybe that wasn't the thing...) Judge: I'm afraid it has revealed a certain over-eagerness... Let me ask again: Leads back to: \"How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock?\" You had heard about it Phoenix: The witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock! Judge: She \"heard\"...? Phoenix: That is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known \"The Thinker\" was a clock! And I can show you the proof! Judge: Well, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had \"heard\" the murder weapon was a clock. Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Phoenix: The defendant's cell phone. Judge: Yes, we've seen that already. Phoenix: Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.] Mia: [Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.] Maya: [Again? What's it this time?] Mia: [It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!] ... Judge: They do mention \"The Thinker.\" But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation? Present Wiretap Phoenix: Leads to: \"Have a look at this.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!) Judge: Mr. Wright! Your evidence, please! Leads back to: \"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\" Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!? April: I... I... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is ridiculous! Phoenix: Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer. April: La... laaa... lrrrrgf! Judge: Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone? April: ... Judge: Miss May! April: Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER! ...... April: I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!) You did it, didn't you? Phoenix: Miss May! April: What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!? Phoenix: You killed her, didn't you! Judge: Order! There will be order! April: What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops! Phoenix: So you admit you tapped her phone! April: Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl! Phoenix: Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!) April: You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will! Phoenix: You can't be serious! No way! April: Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy... Phoenix: R-room service!? April: Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee. Phoenix: I-ice coffee...!? April: Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink* Edgeworth: Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder! Phoenix: ! Judge: So, where does that leave us...? Edgeworth: It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder! Phoenix: (No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...) Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Why the wiretap? Phoenix: Why did you tap her phone? April: ... Phoenix: Answer the question! April: Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant? Phoenix: (Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.)

Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone? Phoenix: (Hah! I'd like to see her pull THAT off!) April: Mr. Lawyer, I saw that evil, evil grin! You were probably thinking \"I'd like to see her pull THAT off,\" weren't you! Phoenix: (Damn... she's good!) April: Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will! Phoenix: You can't be serious! No way! April: Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night?

April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not? April: Oooh. Oooooh! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is irrelevant! Judge: I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap. Edgeworth: This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone? Phoenix: Absolutely! Edgeworth: Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT! Phoenix: Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple! Edgeworth: WHAAAAT!? Phoenix: Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Leads to: \"I present the defendant's cell phone.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This! I think... Judge: That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think... Phoenix: W-wait! That was just a warm up! Judge: Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!

Judge: I'm afraid I'm not sure where you are going with all of this, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Um... \"where\"? Well, it's not so much a place as a... er... Edgeworth: Come to the end of your bluff, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: W-wait! Wait! That was, uh, practice! Here's the real evidence! Judge: Mr. Wright, this court does not condone the presentation of evidence for \"practice.\" Let's see your evidence, for real this time, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"Show me evidence proving that the witness had \"heard\" the murder weapon was a clock.\" Judge: Well, does the defense have anything to say? Phoenix: Um, well... (Come on, think of something!) Call the bellboy as a witness Phoenix: The defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it! April: I think you've sunken quite low enough already. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I object to calling the bellboy! Phoenix: W-why? What's your reason? Edgeworth: Because I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing! Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: However... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness. Phoenix: Condition...? Edgeworth: If Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of \"guilty\" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition. Phoenix: (What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared \"guilty\" on the spot! What should I do...?) Accept the condition Phoenix: (Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition. Edgeworth: Hmph. Fool... You fell right into my trap! Phoenix: (Uh oh!) Uh... um, wait... Leads to: \"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\" Give up Phoenix: (Grr! I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness. Judge: I see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Right. On with the cross-examination. Edgeworth: What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection! Phoenix: (Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!) Judge: Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call? Edgeworth: None, Your Honor. She's the last. Phoenix: (What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The defense would like to call the bellboy after all! Edgeworth: ... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought! Phoenix: ...? Edgeworth: May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced \"guilty\"! Are you prepared to accept my condition? Phoenix: (Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept! Leads to: \"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\" Continue examining Miss May Phoenix: Right. On with the cross-examination. Edgeworth: What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection! Phoenix: (Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!) Judge: Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call? Edgeworth: None, Your Honor. She's the last. Phoenix: (What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The defense would like to call the bellboy after all! Edgeworth: ... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought! Phoenix: ...? Edgeworth: May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced \"guilty\"! Are you prepared to accept my condition? Phoenix: (Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept! Leads to: \"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\" Judge: Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand! Edgeworth: I believe we're ready for the witness to testify. He certainly does look like a bellboy. Bellboy: Yes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service. Judge: That tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado, the witness may begin his testimony. Bellboy: Very good, sir! Witness Testimony -- Miss May's Room Service -- Bellboy: I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations! I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May. She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir. I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course. And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself. Judge: I see. The defense may begin its cross-examination. Phoenix: R-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!) Cross Examination -- Miss May's Room Service -- Bellboy: I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What exactly is it you do at the hotel? Bellboy: Why, anything required of me, sir. I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally. Phoenix: Are you always so... so prim? Judge: Mr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions... Bellboy: I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure it was Miss May on the phone? Bellboy: Absolutely, sir. Phoenix: H-how can you be so certain!? Bellboy: I checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir. Judge: Yes, what then? Bellboy: She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: 9:00 \"on the dot,\" you say? Bellboy: Yes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir. Phoenix: (9:00... the time of the murder!) Bellboy: I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Precisely\" 9:00, then? Bellboy: Precisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM. Phoenix: How can you be so sure!? Bellboy: Miss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. \"Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!\" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir. Phoenix: (Why would she be so particular about the time?) Bellboy: And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You are sure it was Miss April May herself? Bellboy: Ab-SO-lutely, sir. Phoenix: \"Ab-SO-lutely\"...? Bellboy: Yes, sir. As in, \"so very absolutely,\" sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine. Phoenix: How come you're so very certain!? Bellboy: Well, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an \"embrasser,\" sir. Phoenix: \"Embrasser\"!? Is that French for \"embrace\"? Bellboy: It's French for \"kiss,\" sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek. Phoenix: Wh-why would she have done that...? Bellboy: I believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir. Phoenix: (Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!) Phoenix: (This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!) After pressing fourth and fifth statements: Phoenix: ... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?) Edgeworth: Tsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here! Judge: Hmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand. Phoenix: (I can't let this happen... can I?) Protest Leads to: \"W-wait! Please wait!\" Give up Phoenix: (No...! If I give up now, I lose everything... If I just give up the case, I'd be giving up the very reason I became a lawyer!) Leads to: \"W-wait! Please wait!\" Phoenix: W-wait! Please wait! Judge: Yes? Does the defense have something to add? Phoenix: One last question... let me ask one last question! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough! Judge: Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all. Phoenix: (Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?) Check-in Phoenix: T-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May. Bellboy: Oh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really. Phoenix: I see...¬†? Excuse me... what exactly was a \"disappointment\"? Bellboy: Well, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there. Phoenix: (...! What did he say!?) What did you say!? Bellboy: Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite! Phoenix: Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person? Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I object! That was... objectionable!\" Room service Phoenix: T-tell me again about er... room service! Bellboy: A-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall. Phoenix: I see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive? Bellboy: Y-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir. Phoenix: (...! What did he say!?) What did you say!? Bellboy: Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite! Phoenix: Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room? Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I object! That was... objectionable!\" Bed making Phoenix: Bed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day. Edgeworth: I was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low! Judge: Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question. Bellboy: Yes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see. Phoenix: I see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say? Bellboy: Eh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir? Phoenix: Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room? Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I object! That was... objectionable!\" Edgeworth: I object! That was... objectionable! Judge: ... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question. Bellboy: Er... yes, I see. Phoenix: Why did you not mention this in your testimony!? Bellboy: W-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask! Phoenix: (Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention! Bellboy: Ah, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who... Phoenix: ! Bellboy: He asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir. Edgeworth: Oof! Y-you fool! Phoenix: I've done it... I've won! Phoenix: Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct? Bellboy: Yes, sir. Phoenix: Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...? Bellboy: That's right, sir. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: And who, Mr. Wright! Who is this \"other person\"! (Changed from [Who! Who is this 'other person'!] in the original release) Phoenix: Simple, it was... Miss April May Phoenix: None other than Miss April May! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Eh!? Have you heard nothing that has transpired so far!? She has an alibi! She was in the hotel at the time of the murder! Phoenix: Oh... right. Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance! Leads back to: \"Simple, it was...\" The man with Miss May Leads to: \"The man who checked in with Miss May!\" The Bellboy Phoenix: It was the bellboy and none other! Judge: Well, this comes as some surprise... Edgeworth: Your Honor, Mr. Wright... It was the bellboy who confirmed Miss May's alibi... And this in turn confirms the bellboy's alibi! He was in the hotel! Phoenix: Well, s-sure... if you put it that way... Edgeworth: I do put it that way, and I trust you will too! Phoenix: But what if they were in cahoots! Judge: You have evidence of this? Phoenix: Um... no, Your Honor. Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance! Leads back to: \"Simple, it was...\" Phoenix: The man who checked in with Miss May! Edgeworth: Oof! Phoenix: Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!! Edgeworth: M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late... Phoenix: \"Too late\"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court! Edgeworth: Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous! Judge: Enough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood? Edgeworth: Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor. Judge: That is all today for the trial of Maya Fey. Court is adjourned! September 7, 2:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Maya: Mr. Wright! You were amazing in there! Phoenix: R-really? Maya: I think I might be your newest fan! Phoenix: Oh, I was just \"doing my job\" you know... heh heh. Maya: Then again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too... Phoenix: Huh? Maya: That face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine! Phoenix: Hmm... if you say so. Maya: So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now? Phoenix: Um, well... (Changed from [Well, no.] in the original release) No, I don't think so. Not yet. (Changed from [I don't think so. Not yet.] in the original release) Maya: Oh... I see. Phoenix: But I got a great lead in today's trial! Maya: A \"lead\"? Phoenix: That man with Miss May! He's the key! Maya: Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway? Phoenix: I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed. Maya: Yes sir! Phoenix: I'm going to find out more about this man. Maya: Do you think he was the one who...? Phoenix: Maybe so. Maya: Sis... Phoenix: Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise. Maya: I'm counting on you! Phoenix: I asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that hasn't been stricken from the record. (Changed from [In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.] in the original release) May Testimony added to the Court Record. Phoenix: I don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to set her free! (Changed from [Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to get her free!] in the original release) To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory. Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow? Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Maya Fey... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Turnabout Sisters Transcript Transcript (JP) Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 September 7, 3:11 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room April: Well hello! I didn't expect anyone to visit me in such a dank place as this... It's really quite... moving. Not! You stinking lawyer! I hope you die! Have you come to laugh? Yes, laugh at the fallen Miss May! Phoenix: No, not really, there's something I wanted to ask. April: Unfortunately, there is nothing I want to BE asked. Haven't you done enough questioning, you...! Spiky-head! Phoenix: (Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the security guard. April: ... So? What is it you wish to ask of me, then? Hmm? Phoenix: (For starters, how did you get to be so totally whacked!?) Examine Security camera Phoenix: Smile for the camera... Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Or maybe he just doesn't get to see a lot of women like Miss May in here. Talk That \"man\" Phoenix: About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... April: ... Phoenix: Can you tell me about him? Where is he? C'mon... April: No way, Jose. Phoenix: (Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...) The wiretap Phoenix: Why did you place a wiretap on Mia's phone? April: Aww, when you say it like that it sounds so... cold. So criminal! Phoenix: Um... tapping people's phones is a crime, Miss May. April: Oh, and I suppose you learned that in Lawyer School, hmm? Creep! Phoenix: (This woman is impossible to talk to...) Your attitude Phoenix: Say... Why are you so... angry? I mean, you don't look like a bad person... April: Ooh, that does it! Bottom-feeding, scum-sucking lawyer! Phoenix: B-bottom...? (I can't tell, does she have a thing against lawyers... or just against me?) Present Anything April: Hey, guess what. Actually, I, um, really hate your guts. So get lost. Because, well, I'm not cooperating. Phoenix: (Thanks, I noticed.) September 7Fey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Looks like forensics is taking the day off today. Detective Gumshoe's nowhere in sight. The police really gave this place a working over. I doubt there are any valuable clues left. Suppose it can't hurt to take a look around, though. Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. All the cases that the chief worked on are filed here. Hmm. Are some of the files missing...? Nah, I'm imagining things. September 7Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: (Huh. Looks like Grossberg is out today... again. Maybe he's avoiding me for some reason?) Examine Photos on desk Phoenix: What's this? Old photos? There are two lying here. Something's been written in pencil on the backs. \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A,\" \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B\"... Let's take a look at these... \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A\" Phoenix: ... I'm sure I've seen this person somewhere... Perhaps I'll borrow this photo. I'm sure no one will miss just one little photo. And it might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. Photograph quietly added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B\" Phoenix: Why would Grossberg have a picture of this man...? This might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. I'm just borrowing it. I'll return it later. Photograph quietly added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination Leave them alone Phoenix: I don't need it now, whatever it is. If I ever run out of clues, I'll know where to find these. (Although I can't be sure the photos will still be here then...) Leads back to examination Photos on desk (after one has been added to the Court Record) Phoenix: A photo lies on the desk. Maybe I should switch it with the one I took? Swap photos Phoenix: I think I'll swap them... Photograph added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination Leave it alone Phoenix: No, on second thought, I'd better not. Leads back to examination Vacant wall Phoenix: Wait a second... Wasn't there a giant painting hanging on that wall...? Yeah... yeah, it was a painting of... Sunflowers Leads to: \"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.\" Marvin Grossberg Leads to: \"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.\" Fishermen Leads to: \"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.\" Phoenix: Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow. Detention Center (after visiting Grossberg Law Offices) April: YOU AGAIN!? Can't you take a hint and stay gone? Phoenix: Hey, the only reason I'm back here is because YOU won't talk to me! April: Oh, so it's MY fault now? You don't just have spiky hair, you also have a spiky heart. Phoenix: (That does it. When this case is done I'm shaving my head.) Talk That \"man\" Phoenix: About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... Can you tell me about him? Where is he? April: I'm not telling! Phoenix: Look, he's being accused of murder! I don't think you want to be protecting him. April: Hmm. Would you have sold out the late Ms. Fey to the cops? Phoenix: No. April: See? Phoenix: (Damn! Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...) Present Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A) Phoenix: Any thoughts about this photograph? April: ... Who's that? Your mother? Phoenix: (... *sigh* Looks like I've just been wasting my time.) Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Look, I've said several times, I'm not telling you...¬†! Where did you...? Phoenix: (Ah hah! A reaction!) This is him, isn't it? April: What? Who? When? Why...? Phoenix: It IS him. This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder! April: No! No, that's not right. Phoenix: (Nice try, Miss Cooperative.) April: D-do you have proof that was him? Hmm? Y-yeah! Proof! Show me proof! Phoenix: (I'm so close!) September 7Gatewater HotelRoom 303 Bellboy: Ah, welcome, sir! Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself. Phoenix: Oh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that. Bellboy: No, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's \"rep,\" as they say. Phoenix: Huh? \"Rep\"? Bellboy: Yes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir! Phoenix: Whoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder. Bellboy: I, too, will become famous! \"The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee\"...! Phoenix: (Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...) Bellboy: So! You are our honored guest. Please let me know if there is anything I can bring you! Examine Flowers Phoenix: A vase, as expected. I'm not good with flower names, except maybe tulips and sunflowers. Open drawer Phoenix: Huh? There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer! Bellboy: Ah, please leave that as it is, sir. That's the \"Drawer of Terror, Hiding Place of the Murderer's Wiretap.\" It's set to become one of the most popular attractions here. Phoenix: (This guy's serious! I don't believe it...) Table Phoenix: A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. Why hasn't he cleaned these up by now? Bellboy: Ah, I beg your pardon, sir, but if you could please refrain from touching those... It's part of the decor. I call it: \"The last drink... before murder!\" We'll be famous! The talk of the hotel industry! Window Phoenix: Nice weather again today. I can see the Fey & Co. Law Offices, of course. Bellboy: Ah, yes. We plan to install a telescope in that window, of course. Just $5.00 will earn you three minutes of a \"view to a kill\"! Phoenix: ... Bellboy: J-just kidding, sir. Oh hoh hoh hoh! Phoenix: (By that look in his eyes I'd say he was more than serious...) Talk Miss May Phoenix: About Miss May... Bellboy: Oh, her? Sir, not to boast but I knew the moment I saw her... \"She'd do it!\" I said! Phoenix: (Do WHAT!? I'm starting to think the most suspicious person here is this guy!) The man with May Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about the man who was with Miss May...? Bellboy: Ah, yes... He struck me as a real \"Lady Killer,\" if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger. Phoenix: (There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.) Bellboy: If you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him. Phoenix: (A photo. Hmm...) The hotel Phoenix: Could you tell me about this hotel? Bellboy: Absolutely! And on that subject, I have an excellent idea, sir! Currently, this hotel is known as the \"Gatewater.\" I propose that we add a subtitle! Phoenix: A subtitle!? Bellboy: The Gatewater Hotel -- Murder Manor -- Well? What do you think? Phoenix: Um... sounds great! (Whatever floats your tea set...) Present Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A) Phoenix: What about this photo? Bellboy: Well, it's a fine photo, sir. However, the person Miss May was accompanied by was, well, a man. Phoenix: (Oh... yeah. Right.) Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) Phoenix: Take a look at this photo. Bellboy: ... That's him, Detective. Phoenix: Um... I'm the lawyer. Bellboy: Oh, I know that! I just wanted to say \"Detective\" once. You know how it is. Phoenix: (No. No I don't.) Bellboy: Without a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him! Phoenix: An affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...) Have him write it Phoenix: Well, sure. Why not? Bellboy: Yes! I've always wanted to write an affidavit, sir. From hence forth I will be known as \"The Bellboy who swore the affidavit\"! (Changed from [From hence forth I will be known as the 'bellboy who swore the affidavit'!] in the original release) Phoenix: Just hurry up and write it. Bellboy's Affidavit added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (Not even Miss May can play dumb to this!) Leads back to Court Record Turn him down Phoenix: Well thanks, but I don't think that will be necessary. Bellboy: Oh? Oh, I see. Well later then, if you need it. Leads back to Court Record Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (after Bellboy's Affidavit is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Sorry to press the matter, but are you sure this is him? Bellboy: I, too, am sorry to press the matter, but that is him, Detective! Phoenix: Umm... thanks. Bellboy's Affidavit Phoenix: Thanks for this. Bellboy: No no no, not at all, sir! I hope you'll use it to take that Miss May down hard, sir! Hard! Phoenix: (Why do I sense an unhealthy level of excitement behind that unchanging smile? His tea set is rattling!) Anything else Bellboy: I'm sorry... All I could think about during the trial was the hotel... I wasn't paying much attention to the evidence. Grossberg Law Offices (after Bellboy's Affidavit is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: (*sigh* He's out again? Huh? No more photos on the desk...) Detention Center Present Bellboy's Affidavit Phoenix: Could you have a look at this? April: What's that? Phoenix: The bellboy's affidavit! He told us everything he saw. He told us about the man you checked in with. He told us who he was. April: ...! Phoenix: (Now I'm getting somewhere!) Ease her fears Phoenix: (Okay, okay... she's vulnerable now. I should be gentle.) Miss May... It would be easy for me to hand this affidavit to the police. April: ... Phoenix: If they get involved, wouldn't your boss be even more... er... inconvenienced? All I want to do is have a little chat with him. You won't tell me? April: ... Is that all you have to say? Phoenix: Yes. April: Id it's so easy for you to \"get the police involved,\" then why don't you? Somehow I think you're not up to it, hmm? Phoenix: (Show them a little kindness and they jump all over you! That had the opposite effect to what I hoped...) April: Aww. *smirk* Poor little lawyer... And you were so close! Phoenix: (This isn't working... I think I've worn out this piece of paper's usefulness.) Dammit! Bellboy's Affidavit discarded. (Changed from [Discarded the Bellboy's Affidavit.] in the original release) Phoenix: (The man in this photo is the one I want! Why did April May not want to talk about it... she must know him!) Leads back to Court Record Push her hard Phoenix: (This is it, all or nothing! Time to do a little bluff.) No use playing dumb! (If, indeed, that's an act.) If you don't talk, I'm taking this photo to the press! April: Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: Even though he should've been witness to murder, your little \"friend\" is missing. (Changed from [Even though he should be a witness to murder, this man is in hiding.] in the original release) I'm sure the press would have a field day with his reputation! April: ...! Ooooh! Fine! I'll talk! You... you win, Lawyer. Phoenix: (Yes! Man, that felt good! It's great to be alive!) April: Why are you pumping your fists in the air? Phoenix: *cough* Now, tell me about the man you were with. April: That man... He's my boss. Redd White, the president of the information gathering conglomerate, Bluecorp. Phoenix: (Redd... White?) \"Information gathering?\" April: Well... I suppose you could call it a detective agency. (Changed from [Well... I suppose you could call them a detective agency.] in the orignal release) Phoenix: Hmm... So this is the man that was with you the night of the murder? April: ... I'm... I'm scared to talk. I don't want to end up like her! Phoenix: (...!) It's okay, I'll just ask Mr. White himself. Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located? April: ... Phoenix: (Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! If April May couldn't have done it, that leaves him! Time to take action!) Bellboy's Affidavit discarded. (Changed from [Discarded the Bellboy's Affidavit.] in the original release) Leads back to Court Record Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (after presenting Bellboy's Affidavit) Phoenix: How about this photograph? April: You're wasting your time! Miss May's lips are sealed! Gatewater Hotel (after presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: Hmm. The bellboy seems to be out. Huh? The sound of water coming from the shower... Bellboy: \"La-dee-da! Money-Makin'... Money-Makin'... I got the Money-Makin' bluuuues...\" Phoenix: Someone seems to enjoy washing the showers. Examine Open drawer Phoenix: The screwdriver is still stuck in the drawer. I'd better not touch it. No telling what the bellboy would do to me. Table Phoenix: A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. I'd better not touch them. No telling what the bellboy would do to me. Grossberg Law Offices (after presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: (Alright, this is getting ridiculous. Where the heck is that loafer?) Grossberg: *Ah-HHHHEM!* Phoenix: (Ah, that old familiar clearing of the throat...) Grossberg: Ah hah! You again. Phoenix: Um, hello, Mr. Grossberg. Grossberg: ... Well, well. You were quite the thing, my boy. Phoenix: Excuse me...? Grossberg: The trial! The trial! Phoenix: (He was there...?) Grossberg: Reminded me of myself when I was a youth! Phoenix: (I guess something got passed down through Mia... maybe?) Grossberg: It brings back memories, it does! \"Ah... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon...\" you see. ... I apologize. Phoenix: ? Grossberg: I... It was all a bit too much for me, my boy. Seeing you today, I... well, I... ... Phoenix: (I appreciate the reminiscing, but I'd much rather you gave me some information!) Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So you came to see the trial? Grossberg: Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see. I couldn't get a wink of sleep. Phoenix: Really? What was that? Grossberg: Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl. Phoenix: (If you were that worried about it, why didn't you offer to defend her!?) Your refusal Phoenix: I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know. Grossberg: A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy. Phoenix: ... (He does seem troubled about something... Maybe I can find something that will inspire him to talk.) That painting Phoenix: The other day I'm sure there was a big, pretentious-looking painting on that wall... Grossberg: \"Pretentious-looking\"...? Phoenix: Well... you know the one I mean. Anyway, where did it go? Grossberg: Ah, yes, well... I... got rid of it. Got quite tired of the thing, really. I, er, sold it, you see. Yes, that's right. Phoenix: (Sold it!? I'm not sure I buy that...) Wasn't that painting rather important to you, sir? Did something happen? Grossberg: I don't see how it's any of your business! Please, speak no more of that accursed painting. I didn't... I... *mumble* *mumble* Any option (after presenting Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)) Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg...? Grossberg: ... Ah, my apologies. I need to think about things. Alone. Phoenix: (He barely even glanced in my direction...) Present Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (if \"Ease her fears\" was selected upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph... Grossberg: ...! Where did you get that!? Phoenix: I borrowed it. Grossberg: Well, give it back at once! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg. Tell me about the man in this photo. He may have been in that hotel room with April May on the night of the murder. Do you know something about him... anything? Grossberg: ...! Hmm. Ahem! Very well. I'll tell you what I know. However... You didn't hear it from me, if you follow. Phoenix: I follow. Grossberg: That man is Mr. Redd White. He's the President of Bluecorp. Phoenix: (Redd White... Hmm.) Bluecorp... they're something like a detective agency, right? Grossberg: They're information pros. They sell information, you see. Sensitive information. Despite his name, Mr. White has the blackest reputation of any man in this country. Should you run across him, watch what you say. You wouldn't want him digging up any dirt on you. Phoenix: (Hmm... selling information. Sounds like blackmail.) Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located? Grossberg: Hmm... I suppose. Phoenix: (Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! Even if April May couldn't have done it, he could have! Time to take action!) Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg. Grossberg: Now, I must ask you to leave. I need to think about things. Alone. Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (if \"Push her hard\" was selected upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph... Grossberg: Where did you get that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I'm sorry to have taken it without your knowledge. But... I have to know. Who is this man? He was most likely in April May's room the night of the murder. Grossberg: ! What's that you say!? A-are you QUITE sure? My boy? Phoenix: (What has him so flustered I wonder...?) Grossberg: I... I beg your pardon, but I must ask you to leave. I need to be alone. Phoenix: (...! He's fallen silent as a stone. A rather large stone. I guess I should return that photo.) Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg. Anything else Grossberg: I beg your pardon, but I am not at liberty to speak on the matter. After selecting \"Push her hard\" upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, or selecting \"Ease her fears\" upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, then presenting Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) in Grossberg Law Offices: September 7Bluecorp Inc.CEO's Office Phoenix: ... (What's with the surreal d√©cor...?) ???: Welcome! Please furnish me with the title of your personage! Phoenix: (What the...?) White: Your name! What's your name? I was just inquirably asking the title that you go by. Phoenix: Uh... Wright. Phoenix Wright. (\"Inquirably\"...?) White: Mr. Wright, is it? Right, I see... Splendiferous. Perhaps I have intimidated you with my giantesque vocabulary...? Phoenix: (What is this guy's problem!) White: I'm Redd White, CEO of Bluecorp. You know, Corporate Expansion Official? My business dealings bring me into contact with the elite of the elite. So I'm afraid I am not used to conversing with the wordily-challenged. Phoenix: (What a fruitcake!) White: Hmmm, let me guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this! Phoenix: (What does he mean by that?) White: No matter. So, what business does a \"mighty\" lawyer have with a man such as myself? Phoenix: (Yipes! This guy's arrogance meter is off the scale!) Examine Desk Phoenix: I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing. White: It is modeled on my body, see? Well? Does its sleek roundature not... inspire you? Painting Phoenix: ...? Haven't I seen this somewhere...? Is this a replica? White: Ridiculosity! I have no interest in anything but originals. That right there is a bona fide original! Worth five million, for sure. Phoenix: Hmmm... Statue Phoenix: A statue of a man holding up the world. The \"Bluecorp\" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White. White: Truly a work of art! But, probably to beautacious for you to appreciate, correct? Phoenix: (I think it's a little too \"beautacious\" for just about anyone to appreciate.) Trophy display Phoenix: An impressive line-up of trophies. \"Judges Special Runner-up\" \"Best Participation\" \"Judges Cooperation Award\" \"Special Good Try Prize\" Hmm. The words \"Judges\" and \"Special\" kind of stand out. Window Phoenix: This is the top floor of a 20-story building. The view is quite... presidential. Talk Miss May Phoenix: Miss May is an employee of Bluecorp, is she not? White: Correct. She was my secretariat. What a shock it was to hear what she has done! Phoenix: \"What she has done\"... You mean the wiretap? White: Indeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods! It is ineffable that she would do this. Phoenix: (It sounds like he's trying to turn Miss May into a scapegoat...) Night of the murder Phoenix: On the night of the murder were you in April May's hotel room? White: Who can say? I seldom pay attention to mundane details such as time and place. My motto is: \"Don't worry, be happy!\" Phoenix: Still, Mr. White... The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly. White: ... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that. Phoenix: (Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have \"seen\" the same thing as April May!) White: Oh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement! Bluecorp Phoenix: What kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway? White: Ah, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information. We are a company of the future! You might say, we ARE the future! Phoenix: (Sell... information?) White: In just 10 years, I've built this business up into the grand office you see now. Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color \"blue\"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course! Fantabulistic, is it not? That painting (appears after \"Miss May\" and \"Night of the murder\") Phoenix: Uh... there's something that's been bothering me. White: Yes? What might that be? Phoenix: That big painting on the wall over there... It's gorgeous Phoenix: It's a very striking piece of art. White: Magnificentatious, isn't it! Phoenix: Yeah. ... (Why am I making small talk...?) Leads back to Talk options I've seen it before Phoenix: You know, I've actually seen that painting before. White: Oh? Phoenix: Just yesterday, actually. White: Your point being...? Phoenix: My point is simple. Er, rather, my question is simple: Why is that painting hanging on your wall? Leads to: \"...\" When did you get it? Phoenix: Say, when did you get that painting? White: ... Hmm... no idea! I forgot! Phoenix: I've seen that painting before. Yesterday, in fact. Why do I find that painting here today? Leads to: \"...\" Present Wiretap Phoenix: About this wiretap... White: Ah, the one that Miss May used, right? Bad girl. Bad, bad girl. Phoenix: She testified that she placed the wiretap at your request. White: How pathetic. I guess she's trying to pass the buck. Bad, bad girl. Sorry I can't help you. I know nothing. Phoenix: (I'm going to need hard evidence to get anything out of this guy...) Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) Phoenix: About this picture... White: Gorgeous! That's a picture of me! Ah, I see it was taken in the prime of my youth. About 10 years ago, at a guess. Phoenix: The hotel bellboy says he saw this man on the night of the murder. White: ... On closer inspection, he does look a lot like me, but I'm afraid this is someone else. Nope. That's definitely not me. He's far too young. Anything else White: I am terribly sorry. But that really doesn't seem to concern me at all. White: ... Mr. Wrong, was it? Phoenix: Wright. White: It appears you do not fully grasp your position here. I ask again. Who are you? Phoenix: Umm... huh? A lawyer? White: No, my feeble friend. A \"mere\" lawyer. Worth nothing. Zilch. Zippo. Nada! Just like that sorry excuse for an attorney, Grodyburger! Phoenix: (Wh-what!?) Ungh! Oof...! Unh... uhhh... (He... he punched me!) White: Well, Mr. Lawyer. What will you do, eh? Charge me with assault? Charge away, I welcome it! For it is YOU who will be found guilty! Phoenix: What...? White: Heed my exposition! The police, the courts, they all do my bidding. Phoenix: (So you say... But I wonder... Is that kind of control really possible?) White: I don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume? Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg's... yes. White: Then you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you? Perhaps he will explain how a man can live life purely for personal profit! ... Go now! Skedaddle! There is nothing more to discuss! Examine Desk Phoenix: I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing. Painting Phoenix: This painting was, until yesterday, hanging in Mr. Grossberg's office. Why does White have it now? It's not hard to imagine a few possibilities. Statue Phoenix: A statue of a man holding up the world. The \"Bluecorp\" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White. Trophy display Phoenix: An impressive line-up of trophies. \"Judges Special Runner-up\" \"Best Participation\" \"Judges Cooperation Award\" \"Special Good Try Prize\" Hmm. The words \"Judges\" and \"Special\" kind of stand out. He probably strong-armed them into giving him something. Talk Any option White: Would you be kind enough to cease your inane chattering and vacate the premises? Let me put it in language you are sure to understand: Shut up and get out! I have nothing more to say. Present Anything White: Would you be kind enough to cease your inane chattering and vacate the premises? Let me put it in language you are sure to understand: Shut up and get out! I have nothing more to say. Detention Center (after visiting Bluecorp) Phoenix: Apparently, Miss May is in questioning. I doubt they'll let me talk to her today. Examine Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Grossberg Law Offices (after selecting \"\"I've seen it before\" or \"When did you get it?\" upon selecting \"That painting\" Talk option in Bluecorp) Grossberg: ... ... ... Phoenix: (Huh? I don't think he's noticed me standing here. Maybe I should... clear my throat?) Aaa-HHHEM! Grossberg: Jumping Jehosephats! Oh! You! Phoenix: What's wrong? You looked so pensive... like an old man at the end of his days. Grossberg: Hmm? I'm not senile yet! I was just thinking about this whole mess... Phoenix: (Something's really bothering him, that much is clear.) Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So you came to see the trial? Grossberg: Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see, couldn't get a wink of sleep. Phoenix: Really? What was that? Grossberg: Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl. Your refusal Phoenix: I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know. Grossberg: A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy. Phoenix: ... (He does seem troubled about something... I'm starting to have a feeling I know what it is.) Mr. White Phoenix: So, I paid Bluecorp a visit. Grossberg: Oh? Oh, I see. Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg... I have to admit, something has been bothering me. Grossberg: Oh? What is it? Well, out with it, my boy! Phoenix: You see, it's just... That big painting Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had \"no intention of parting with\"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office. Grossberg: ... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting... Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, I know you and Mr. White are connected somehow! Grossberg: C-connected, you say? Phoenix: Yes! And I know what it is... He's giving you information Phoenix: You're his client, aren't you? He's giving you information! Grossberg: What's that now? Phoenix: You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services! Grossberg: ... Phoenix: You gave him that painting in exchange for some valuable information, didn't you? Grossberg: Utterly ridiculous. Me, his client? I would never willingly deal with that man. Never! Phoenix: (Huh? Did I get it wrong?) Leads back to Talk options He's blackmailing you Phoenix: Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail? Grossberg: ...! Phoenix: I think that painting is fairly gaudy proof. Grossberg: ... Very well. This may be the chance I've been waiting for. Maybe it's time to get this off my chest, so I can finally rest easy again. After all, you were Mia's understudy. Perhaps it was fate? Phoenix: (What's he talking about...?) Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" You're lovers Phoenix: It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you! Grossberg: W-w-what! My boy! Phoenix: You sent that painting to him! As a sign! A sign of undying love! Grossberg: M-m-my boy, please! You're letting your fancies run away with you! Where do you get these bizarre ideas? Phoenix: I... I don't understand how you could... Grossberg: That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous! ... Enough. I'll swallow my pride and tell you all. Phoenix: (I knew it! They are lovers!) Grossberg: N-no! We are NOT lovers! Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" That photo of Mr. White Phoenix: That photo of Mr. White... Why would you have his photo, Mr. Grossberg? Grossberg: Umm... yes, well. It's been a long time since then... Phoenix: A long time ago? I'm sorry... but I think not. I think you still have ties to Mr. White even today. Grossberg: R-really! Whatever gave you that idea! W-what connection could I possibly have to an individual such as he? Phoenix: It's pretty straightforward, actually... You go drinking together Phoenix: You go drinking together! You're friends, aren't you? Grossberg: ... Now you're being foolish, my boy. Why in the world would I ever drink with the likes of him!? Phoenix: (Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.) Leads back to Talk options He's blackmailing you Phoenix: Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail? Grossberg: ...! I don't... I don't know what you're talking about! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had \"no intention of parting with\"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office. Grossberg: ... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting... Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg... tell me what happened. Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" He's giving you information Phoenix: Redd White is supplying you with information, obviously! Grossberg: What's that now? Phoenix: You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services! Grossberg: ... Now you're being foolish, my boy. What possible use could I have for the services of the likes of him!? Phoenix: (Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.) Leads back to Talk options Why wouldn't you defend Maya? Phoenix: I thought it was strange. Here was Maya, your own apprentice's little sister, in desperate need... Accused of killing her own sister no less, and you wouldn't take the case! I finally realized why. You and Redd White are connected. He's... Your boss Phoenix: I'll bet you and White go way back! He's your boss now, and was before, I bet! Grossberg: My what? Boss? Are you serious? Phoenix: Yeah! You both have that sort of \"we're in the same club together\" feel to you. Grossberg: Please, stop. You have a very peculiar sense of humor, Mr. Wright. Very well, I'll talk. Phoenix: (What does he mean... \"sense of humor\"? I was serious!) Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" Blackmailing you Phoenix: Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail? Grossberg: ...! I don't... I don't know what you're talking about! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had \"no intention of parting with\"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office. Grossberg: ... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting... Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg... tell me what happened. Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" Your lover Phoenix: It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you! Grossberg: W-w-what! My boy! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg. The other day, there was a giant painting hanging on that wall. I saw that painting again, today. It was in the CEO's office of Bluecorp. It was a present, wasn't it? Grossberg: Well, my boy, you have a splendid imagination! Phoenix: I... I don't understand how you could... Grossberg: That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous! Phoenix: (Hmm... I guess I was wrong. But it just seemed so right!) Leads back to Talk options Present Anything Grossberg: Sorry, my boy. I don't think I can help you with that. Grossberg: Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now... Phoenix: (15 years...!) Grossberg: All because of the \"DL-6 Incident,\" as you may have guessed. Phoenix: (The name on the back of those photographs!) Grossberg: As you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did. Phoenix: (So that's the connection!) Grossberg: It is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible. Phoenix: Impossible? Why!? Grossberg: He has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians. Phoenix: What!? Grossberg: They are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years. Talk The DL-6 Incident Phoenix: What is the \"DL-6 Incident\"? Grossberg: \"DL-6\" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium. Phoenix: (A medium...?) Grossberg: Her name was Misty Fey. Phoenix: (Fey!) Grossberg: Indeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud. Phoenix: (This is what Maya was talking about the other day!) Grossberg: I did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident. Reason for blackmail Phoenix: But why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg? Grossberg: The DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him. Phoenix: You told White? Grossberg: He offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail. Phoenix: ... I see. Grossberg: ... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office. Phoenix: Mia's office...? Grossberg: She followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found. Fey & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Reason for blackmail\" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices) Phoenix: It's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look. Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: All the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here. They're in alphabetical order. Let's take a look... Which file should I look at...? File \"A-I\" Phoenix: Let's see if there's \"A\" record in this file that catches my \"I.\" \"A\"... \"B\"... \"F\"! \"Misty Fey.\" That's Mia and Maya's mother. Hmmm... Should I take a look? Read it Mia: \"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press. This parasite, who makes his fortune on threats and coercion... His name is...\" Phoenix: Hmm. The record stops there. ... So Mia knew Grossberg... Leads back to examination Leave it be Phoenix: I don't think it has much to do with the current case. I'd be interested to know what it contains... but I'll leave it alone for now. Leads back to examination File \"J-S\" Phoenix: Let's see... \"J\" through \"S\"... Nothing much in here. Maybe I'll just skim some of this? Skim Phoenix: *sigh* Well, no harm in flipping through a bit, I guess... The biggest part's here at the end in \"S\"... \"Suicide\"? Eww... She has a collection of suicide reports. There's politicians... policemen... ... ...! There's writing on most of these in pencil. \"White\"...? This is Mia's handwriting. Wait, I get it! Mia thought he was involved in these \"suicides\"! White drove them all to... ... I can use these newspaper clippings. Hmm... let's find the most disturbing one... Newspaper Clipping added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination Leave it be Phoenix: Nah... this is taking too long. Later. *yawn* I've never been good at reading these things. Leads back to examination File \"T-Z\" Phoenix: \"T\"... \"U\"... I know, \"W\"! \"White\"! ...¬†! The entire \"W\" section is missing! Was it taken...? Leads back to examination Bookshelf (after Newspaper Clipping is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Shall I check Mia's files once more? Check 'em Phoenix: Which file to check? File \"J-S\" Phoenix: Hmm... not much in the \"J-S\" section. I'm not sure reading suicide accounts will be very good for my mood... I think that's enough reading for today. Leads back to examination Leave 'em Phoenix: I don't see much point in checking files that are missing all the key parts. *yawn* I give up. Leads back to examination Grossberg Law Offices Present Newspaper Clipping Phoenix: I found this in Mia's files... Grossberg: So she was investigating Redd White, as I expected. Well, if you wanted to challenge him, you could present this in court. Phoenix: (Not a bad idea...) Bluecorp (after Newspaper Clipping is added to the Court Record) White: Well, aren't you persistent. Phoenix: Sorry, but there's something I have to ask you. White: Mr. Lawyer, I really hate having to repeat myself... But it seems the message has not yet penetrated your thick skull... Stop bothering me! If you try my patience further, I fear a nasty accident may occur. Do I make myself clear? Phoenix: (Transparent...) Talk Miss May Phoenix: (I think we're past needing to talk about April May. I've got to put this guy on the spot, and quick!) White: Hmm? What's the matter? You seem... distressed! Night of the murder Phoenix: (This guy is a pro at pulling the wool over people's eyes. I've got to put him on the spot, and quick!) White: Stop that! Your hot gaze is giving me goosebumps! Blackmail Phoenix: (There's no point asking someone this crooked a straight question! I need some evidence I can use as ammo...) White: What's wrong? Is something stuck to my face? Why yes! There's my eyes, and my nose, and my mouth... But of course I jest. You need not restrain your mirth, my friend! It is okay to indulge in my cosmopolitan sense of humor. I will not think less of you. Present Newspaper Clipping Phoenix: (This is the only clue that Mia left me... I'd better make this one count!) Mr. White... see this? It's an article describing the suicide of a politician. White: ... Phoenix: He was embezzling secret government funds. Then, one day, word got leaked to the press. The very next day he took his own life. White: And this concerns me how...? Phoenix: I found this article in Mia's office. White: Miss Mia...? Phoenix: She had a file filled with articles like this. Every one of them was labeled with a single word... \"White.\" White: ...! Phoenix: Mr. White, I know what you did to this politician. You bribed him Phoenix: You bribed him! White: B-bribed!? ... What exactly has led you to say this? Phoenix: (Um... gee, that's a good question. I guess I got ahead of myself there...) White: Hmph. You certainly have an active imagination. Phoenix: (Dammit!) Leads back to Court Record You spied on him Phoenix: You were spying on him, weren't you? White: \"Spying\"...? Phoenix: You snooped on him, and found out about the embezzlement. Then, when you revealed it, he was driven to suicide! White: Mr. Lawyer. I know nothing of this. And, even in the highly unlikely event that I did do such a thing... All I would have done is provide \"information.\" That is not a crime in this country. Phoenix: (Gah! This guy's as cool as a cucumber...!) Leads back to Court Record You blackmailed him Leads to: \"You were blackmailing him!\" Anything else White: I have no intention of parleying with you about this matter. Phoenix: You were blackmailing him! White: Blackmail? Phoenix: Not just him, either. You were threatening and coercing hundreds of others! You were involved in all of the suicide cases that Mia investigated! This company is built on blackmail! I'm right, aren't I? White: What a bizarre accusation. Mr. Wrong... What is it that you should be doing now? Investigating me? No no no. I think not! You should be searching for the one who killed Miss Mia! Interphone: *beep* [Secretary's Office, hello?] White: Mr. Wrong will be leaving now. Interphone: [Yes, sir. I'll send someone right away.] Phoenix: Wait a second, Mr. White... You're right Phoenix: You are absolutely right. I should be looking for the killer now. And actually, I've done better. I've found him. He's sitting right in front of me. Leads to: \"Just what are you insinuating?\" You're wrong Phoenix: You're wrong, Mr. White. White: Excuse me? Phoenix: What I should be doing now is going after you! Leads to: \"Just what are you insinuating?\" White: Just what are you insinuating? Phoenix: Mia was on to you. She was keeping tabs. For this reason you had April May tapping her phone. Then, Mia was murdered, and all the documents about you mysteriously disappeared. So, the culprit would be...? White: ... Phoenix: Even a child could work it out, Mr. White. You did it! White: ... Interphone: *beep* [Secretary's office.] White: We won't be needing an escort for Mr. Wrong. Instead, please connect me to the public prosecutor's office. Interphone [Of course, sir. One moment please...] ... [White? That you? What are you doing calling me at a time like this!?] White: Hello. Chief Prosecutor? I've changed my mind. I want to testify tomorrow. Interphone: [What's this about?] White: The Mia Fey case. I witnessed the murder, you see. And, thus, as a very important witness, I would like to testify. Interphone: [What? Why now? I thought you said you didn't want to go to court?] White: Quietude...! I told you I changed my mind, didn't I? Oh, and one other thing. Send the police over here right away. The man is standing right in front of me. He looks dazed but could be violent! Interphone: [What? What man?] White: Are you even listening? The executioner! The hatchet-man! The liquidator... The killer, man! Phoenix: What!? Interphone: [Mr. White... this isn't another one of those...] White: Chief Prosecutor. I do not believe you are in a position to freely offer your opinions to me, correct? I'm telling you to send the police, now! Interphone: *beep* White: ... Did I not tell you, Mr. Wrong? You are a mere lawyer! As was Miss Mia. Phoenix: How dare you! White: I'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled. No lawyer of any worth will defend you. I have friends in the local lawyer's association, you see. You'll be given a lawyer so stupendously inept that they make even you look competent. Phoenix: (I... I feel faint.) Gumshoe: Detective Gumshoe, reporting, sir! Aaa! Butz! Hairy Butz! Phoenix: Wright, actually. Phoenix Wright. And my friend's name is \"Larry\"... Gumshoe: Oh, right! Sorry, pal. Butz was that murderer, right? White: Detective Gumshoe. I present to you, the man who killed Miss Mia Fey! Gumshoe: W-what!? White: Take this despicable human being into custody. ... Farewell, Mr. Wrong! September 8, 3:37 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: I can't believe it's only been a day since the first trial. My trial begins tomorrow. White's going to set a trap for me. And the prosecution will be in on it, of course. Edgeworth, included. An attorney was assigned to me by the state, yesterday. I refused. I had an idea. Maya: ... Wright! Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Oh, Maya! Great, they let you out of detention. Maya: Just now, yes. It's all thanks to you! Phoenix: Hah. Now I'm afraid we've switched places. Maya: What? You mean, you...? Phoenix: I explained what had happened to Maya. ... Maya: I don't believe it! How many people does that man need to destroy before he's satisfied!? My mother... My sister... And now you! This has gone too far! Mr. Wright, please tell me, is there anything I can do? Phoenix: Um... well... Defend me in court Phoenix: Alright, you can be my defense lawyer tomorrow! Maya: Alright! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Leave it to me! I am Mia's sister, after all! Lawyership runs in our blood! Phoenix: (Wasn't it ghost powers that ran in your blood...?) (Changed from [Wasn't it E.S.P. that ran in your blood...?] in the original release) Maya: I'd better run to the bookstore and pick up a copy of \"Law for Rookies.\" Leads to: \"...\" Cheer me on in court Phoenix: Well, you could cheer for me in court. Maya: Cheer for you? You mean... like a cheerleader? Phoenix: Huh? Um, yeah, like that. Maya: Alright! Leave it to me! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: I'd better go get a uniform and some pom-poms...! Leads to: \"...\" Help me break out of here Phoenix: Right. Okay, listen up. I want you to help me break out of here! Maya: You mean... a jail break? Phoenix: Yeah. Tonight's our only chance! Maya: Alright! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Oh, I'd better go get a hacksaw while the stores are still open. Oh, oh! And a rope ladder, and a getaway car! Can you drive? Leads to: \"...\" Phoenix: ... W-wait. Wait wait wait. Maya: What what what? Phoenix: I'm kidding! It was a joke! Maya: No way! Phoenix: No really, I was kidding. But thanks. It's good to know you're on my side. (And there really isn't anything you can do for me anyway...) Maya: But... but I can't just sit here and do nothing! I've got to give that man a piece of my mind! Phoenix: (Just a piece...?) Okay. Then, come to the court tomorrow. Maya: O-okay! I'll be there! I'll show them a thing or two! Phoenix: Times may change, yet with crime it's the same old story. (Changed from [It's the beginning of a new century, yet with crime it's the same old story.] in the original release) In fact, it's gotten worse. Lengthy court proceedings are no longer realistic. Beginning a few years ago, a limit of three days was put on initial court trials. Almost all finish in a day. Most with a guilty verdict. I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself for this case. (Changed from [I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself.] in the original release) With the true culprit appearing as the star witness. (Changed from [Tomorrow the true culprit will appear as a witness.] in the original release) This is it! Tomorrow, it's me or him! (Changed from [This is it! It's me or him!] in the original release) To be continued.

I guess this is it!Phoenix: Yeah. One way or another, this case gets decided today.Maya: Aaa! Ph-Phoenix! Look!Phoenix: (...! Prosecutor... Edgeworth.)Edgeworth: I received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.Phoenix: ?Edgeworth: He told me that whatever Mr. White says today, it will be the \"absolute truth.\" No matter how you try to attack his testimony... If I raise an objection, I have it on good faith that the judge will listen to me.Phoenix: (What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?) So... you're saying I'm going to be guilty. End of story?Edgeworth: ... I will do anything to get my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.Maya: Why... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?Edgeworth: \"Innocent\"...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared \"guilty\"! So I make that my policy.Phoenix: Edgeworth... You've changed.Maya: Hmm? Phoenix! You know him!?Edgeworth: Don't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.Maya: Ph-Phoenix...?Phoenix: Well... court will be starting soon. (Changed from [Well... court will be opening for session soon.] in the original release)Maya: What? But wait! Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! They're not...

Are you sure you're up to doing this?Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.Judge: Understood. Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth: As the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of a witness to the defendant's crime. (Changed from [today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime.] in the original release)Judge: I see. The prosecution may call its witness.Phoenix: (That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)Objection Phoenix: Mr. Edgeworth, you owe an explanation to the court! Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!? Edgeworth: Hmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court. Judge: Excellent, Mr. Edgeworth. I appreciate your demeanor. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (Great. He gets to show off and I get nowhere.) Leads to: \"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!\"Let it go Phoenix: (Forget it. I smell a trap.) Leads to: \"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!\"Edgeworth: I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!Edgeworth: Please state your full name.White: You wish to know the title of my personage?Edgeworth: Er... your name?White: Yes! That is what I said! Oh dear, do my locutions confuse?Edgeworth: Name!Phoenix: (These two are great together...)White: My name is Redd White. But my friends call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO, or to use a more common term, the President, of Bluecorp.Edgeworth: Did you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?White: That would be a negatory! No, I did not.Edgeworth: ... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?White: Correct.Edgeworth: And you witnessed the murder from there?White: Ahem. Why tell you what you already know?Judge: Very well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.Phoenix: (If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)White: Ho hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix: ...!Maya: Let him have it, Phoenix!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --White: Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe. I was quietly perusifying... er, that's \"reading\" to you, some papers by the window. Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside! Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way. It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair! Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer! I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was flabbergasted of course. The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase! Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Judge: Hmm... If things occurred as you testify, then I'm afraid the defendant is guilty. Very well, defendant... er, I mean, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination...Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Witness's Account --White: Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How do you know what time it was?

So... what was the proper term for \"secretary\" again...? Anyway, Miss May ordered room service for 9:00. It happened soon after the room service arrived. Phoenix: (Hmm. That's what Miss May said, too.) Press further Phoenix: True, the bellboy who brought the coffee saw Miss May. But he testified that he did not see you at the time! White: Ahem. This is your concern? Silly Lawyer! Miss May received the coffee outside the room! Of course he could not see me. He would need X-ray vision to pull off something like that! Phoenix: (Hmm...) Edgeworth: Tell us, what were you doing at the time? Leads back to cross-examination Hold back Phoenix: (I don't see anything to gain by attacking him on this point any further.) Okay, what were you doing at the time? Leads back to cross-examinationWhite: I was quietly perusifying... er, that's \"reading\" to you, some papers by the window.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: By window, you mean the one directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Office? White: Correct! That is the only window, you see. Phoenix: And there you were reading... papers? White: Correct! The Gatewater is a businessman's hotel, and I am a busy man who had business to do!White: Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A \"bedlam\"? White: It must have been when you attacked, I assume. Edgeworth: We see. Continue.White: Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you were reading your papers until you heard that sound? White: But of course. I am no snoop, peeping out of windows at night. Phoenix: (No snoop? Yeah, right! You've made a career out of snooping!)White: It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: S-spiky-haired!?White: Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What you just said directly conflicts with Miss May's testimony! Miss May clearly stated that the assailant looked like a \"girl\"! White: I've always been proud of my eyesight, Mr. Lawyer. Phoenix: Just what is your eyesight? White: Counting both eyes... 40! Phoenix: 40!? Don't add them together! Judge: I think the witness is trying to say his eyesight is good. Phoenix: (Hey, whose side is the judge on, anyway?) Edgeworth: And what did you do then?White: I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was surprised of course.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What was Miss May doing at that time? White: She had just finished watching a soap opera on the TV, and was weeping openly. Phoenix: Did you know she had been tapping the Fey office phone? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Irrelevant! That has nothing to do with the case at hand. White: I care not. I will answer the lawyer's bold inquiry. Miss May was acting alone when she tapped the phone of this Fey woman. Phoenix: You'd make a good politician, Mr. White. White: Ho hoh! After all, I am \"El Presidente.\" Judge: Please continue.White: The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Can you be a little more detailed about that? I think it's worth knowing exactly what happened. White: Of course! Comprende! I understand! The victim was attacked, by you, and ran to the left. You gave chase, and struck her down! Edgeworth: Are you sure? White: As you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect! Judge: Perhaps you could change your testimony to reflect this new detail. Changes statement from \"The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!\" to \"The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!\"White: The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure about that? White: How many times must I say it? I am abso-posi-lutely perfect! End of story! Phoenix: (How many times must I hear that?) Maya: Psst! Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as a little odd?Present May Testimony Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wait right there!\"White: Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Um... \"impaction\"? Don't you mean just \"impact\"? White: Ridiculosity! I think you need to brush up on your language skills! Phoenix: (On second thought, perhaps I'd better leave the whole language thing alone...)Phoenix: (Did Edgeworth \"prep\" this guy, too, I wonder? Anyway, I'd better find a weakness in there...)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Chief Attorney at Fey & Co..

Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask. ???: I know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you? Mia: Sharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here. ???: I gotcha. So, what is it this time? Mia: It's... a clock. ???: A clock? Mia: Yeah, it's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys. ???: Hey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis! Mia: Now, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now. ???: Huh? It's not working? That's lame! Mia: I had to take the clockwork out. Sorry.

Episode 2Turnabout Sisters September 5, 9:08 PMFey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Uh oh, I'm late. Huh, that's strange. The chief must have gone home already. She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!) Examine Anywhere Phoenix: I smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay! Phoenix: That smell... Blood! ???: ... *sob* Sis... Phoenix: (Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...? Chief!!! Phoenix: Who are you? ???: ... Phoenix: (The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.) Phoenix: Chief... Examine Broken glass Phoenix: Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand. Chair Phoenix: The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too. Mia Fey's body Phoenix: Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. \"The Thinker\" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon. The Thinker added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room. Glass Shards added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be? Mia Fey's body (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly. \"Maya\" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices) Phoenix: ! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday. Receipt added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.) \"Maya\" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; after clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices) Phoenix: ! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday. (Wait a second! \"Maya\"...! Was Mia trying to tell us something about that girl? I think I'd better show her this receipt. I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom!) Receipt added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.) \"Maya\" scrap of paper (subsequent times; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices) Phoenix: ! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday. (I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.) \"Maya\" scrap of paper (subsequent times; after clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices) Phoenix: ! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday. (Wait a second! \"Maya\"...! Was Mia trying to tell us something about that girl? I think I'd better show her this receipt. I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom! I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.) \"The Thinker\" statue Phoenix: It's encrusted with dried blood. How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again. Window Phoenix: There's a large building right across from the office. The \"Gatewater Hotel.\" A nice, luxurious place. Bookshelf Phoenix: All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings. Computer Phoenix: Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing. Desk Phoenix: A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office d√©cor: \"Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple.\" Ledger book Phoenix: The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money. Corded phone Phoenix: Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart. ???: Police!? Please, come quick! Phoenix: (Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand... Corded phone (subsequent times) Phoenix: The phone receiver is missing a few screws. I'd better not use it. Fey & Co. Law Offices If Fey & Co. Law Offices is being visited for the first time, before Receipt is added to the Court Record Phoenix: ...! (That girl just now... where'd she go!? I put her right there on that sofa...! Uh oh... I hope she didn't run on me.) Yipes! (Don't scare me like that...) Umm... Excuse me but, who are you? ???: ... Phoenix: It's okay. I work here. Maya: Maya... Maya Fey. Phoenix: Maya... Fey? If Fey & Co. Law Offices is being visited for the first time, after Receipt is added to the Court Record Phoenix: ...! (That girl just now... where'd she go!? I put her right there on that sofa...! Uh oh... I hope she didn't run on me.) Yipes! (Don't scare me like that...) Umm... Excuse me but, who are you? ???: ... Phoenix: It's okay. I work here. Maya: Maya... Maya Fey. Phoenix: Maya... Fey? (\"Maya\"...? So Mia was writing this girl's name! Maybe I should show her the receipt? I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom!) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant. Door Phoenix: The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob. Painting Phoenix: A large painting. I guess you'd call this \"modern art.\" I, on the other hand, call it a mistake. Reception desk Phoenix: The reception desk. I usually sit here. Sofa Phoenix: This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model. Writing desk Phoenix: A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies. Talk What happened Phoenix: (She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened? Maya: ... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...! Phoenix: (So she was already dead.) You and the Chief Phoenix: So, you're the chief's...? Maya: Sister. I'm her younger sister. Phoenix: And you were here... visiting? This late at night? Maya: Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her. Phoenix: Evidence...? Maya: Yes... I-it was that clock... It was \"The Thinker.\" Present The Thinker Phoenix: Um, about \"The Thinker\"... Maya: ! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob* Phoenix: (Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...) Glass Shards Phoenix: This was lying next to the chief. Maya: I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand. Phoenix: Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...) Receipt (before examining corded phone in Office) Phoenix: Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt. Maya: ! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name? Phoenix: Please, just calm down. Maya: W-why would Sis write my name? Phoenix: (Uh-oh. Now I've done it... I'd better hurry up and call the police!) Receipt (after examining corded phone in Office) Phoenix: Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt. Maya: ! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name? Phoenix: Please, just calm down. Maya: W-why would Sis write my name? Phoenix: (Uh-oh. Now I've done it...) Anything else Maya: I'm sorry, I've never seen that before. After examining corded phone in Office and presenting Receipt in Fey & Co. Law Offices: *whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*... *whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*... Phoenix: ! The police! (Sounds like they're coming this way!) Freeze! Police! Gumshoe: Alright, I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, see? Phoenix: (Gumshoe...? What an odd name.) Gumshoe: We received a report from the building across the way, see. Got a person saying they saw a murder. Phoenix: (It must have been that woman I saw.) Gumshoe: Anyway, I don't want either of you moving one inch, 'kay? Phoenix: (Great. Just great. Maya... Wait, she wouldn't have... nah.) Gumshoe: Whoaaaaaaaaaaaah! Scuze me! Maya: Eek! Gumshoe: This word \"Maya\" here mean anything to you? Maya: ...! Um... that... That's my name... Gumshoe: WHAAAAT!? The victim drew this here note in her own blood, see? With her dying breath, she wrote down the killer's name! Maya: K-killer...? I'm not-- Gumshoe: Case closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am. Maya: W-what? Phoenix: Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible. September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.) Maya: Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning. Phoenix: Good morning! (She looks so tired...) Maya: Um... Are you going to be my attorney? Phoenix: Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about... It's up to you Phoenix: (I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you. Maya: Up... to me? Phoenix: Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here. Maya: ... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it! Leads to: \"Did I look at her like that?\" Of course I will Phoenix: (First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up! Maya: R-really...? Phoenix: (Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it? Maya: ... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it! Leads to: \"Did I look at her like that?\" Sorry, not a chance Phoenix: (Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding... Maya: ... ... ... Phoenix: (Eh heh. Whoops. That didn't go so well.) Maya: ...Heh... Phoenix: Huh? M-Maya...? Was that a... chuckle? Maya: What? N-no! ... It wasn't very believable, was it? Phoenix: (Not really...) Maya: I-I'm sorry! I just thought, since you'd made a joke... Please, don't mind me! You're doing just fine! Phoenix: (Who's trying to cheer up who here!?) Maya: ... I knew it. No one will believe me. Phoenix: What? Maya: Even you-- when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it! Leads to: \"Did I look at her like that?\" Phoenix: (Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought... Maya: I-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you. Phoenix: Heard...? Heard what about me? Maya: I... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day... Mia: \"Today was my junior partner's first time in court.\" Maya: Wow! Really? How'd that go? Mia: \"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while...\" Maya: Hah! So, he crashed and burned? Mia: \"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience.\" Maya: Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now! Mia: \"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty.\" Maya: That's what she said! Phoenix: ... Maya: I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you... Phoenix: No, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia... Maya: ... I know... Examine Security camera Phoenix: Smile for the camera... Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Talk Maya Phoenix: There's something I've been wanting to ask you... Maya: Yes? Phoenix: What's with that outfit? Maya: Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say. Phoenix: A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do? Maya: Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training. Phoenix: A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.) The day of the crime Phoenix: Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Maya: Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial. Phoenix: Evidence? Maya: Yes. That clock shaped like \"The Thinker.\" Phoenix: (The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case? Maya: Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice? Phoenix: H-her own voice!? Maya: Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone. Phoenix: You recorded it! Maya: Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things. The day of the crime (after clearing \"Your cell phone\" Talk option) Phoenix: Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard. Maya: No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial. Phoenix: (That's \"The Thinker\" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office? Maya: It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister... Phoenix: Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now. Your cell phone (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it! Maya: Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry. Phoenix: Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it. Maya: I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay? Phoenix: Sure, thanks. Maya's Memo added to the Court Record. Your cell phone (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it! Maya: Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry. Phoenix: Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it. Maya: I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay? Phoenix: Sure, thanks. Spirit mediums (appears after \"Maya\") Phoenix: So you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training. Maya: That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world. Phoenix: Wait a second, you said the \"Fey Family\"? So, Mia was into this stuff too? Maya: Of course! She left the mountain to \"follow her career,\" she said. Her powers were first-class, too! Phoenix: (I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...! Maya: What? Phoenix: So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that? Maya: Yes. ...In training. Phoenix: Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her! Maya: ...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level... Phoenix: (Hmm... I thought that would be too easy.) Present The Thinker Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about the murder weapon... Maya: Poor Sis... *sniff* Phoenix: (Hmm. Better not ask her about this now.) Glass Shards Phoenix: This was lying next to the chief's body... Maya: I saw that too. They said they thought these were pieces of a broken light stand. Phoenix: Yeah, that seems about right. (Though I'd never heard of a glass light stand before this...) Receipt Phoenix: Remember that receipt? Maya: Y-you mean the one with my name on it? Phoenix: Any idea why she... Maya: Absolutely none! Um... Do you trust me? I trust you Phoenix: I trust you. Maya: Why? Don't you think I did it, too? Phoenix: No, I don't. (It's just a hunch, but...) Maya: That detective thinks I did it. Phoenix: ... Leads back to Court Record I don't trust you Phoenix: ... Maya: I didn't think you'd believe me. You're just like the detective. Phoenix: I'm sorry... I don't like lying just to make people feel better. But it doesn't mean that I've decided you did it! (She seemed so lost at the crime scene.) Leads back to Court Record Maya's Memo Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about your cell phone... Maya: That detective took it when they brought me in. Phoenix: (So, Gumshoe took it... I'll have to try to get it back next time I see him...) Anything else Maya: Sorry... I've never seen that before. After clearing all Talk options: Maya: ... Um...! Phoenix: Huh? Something the matter? Maya: Um... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor? Phoenix: ...? Maya: This is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me? Phoenix: (Hmm...) Accept Phoenix: Sure, why not? I'll go ask. Maya: Thank you so much! I have no one else to turn to... Phoenix: ...? Say, what about your parents...? Maya: ... ... ... Phoenix: I... I see. Don't worry, leave it to me. Maya: Thank you! The trial's tomorrow... at 10:00. Phoenix: W-what!? Tomorrow!? Maya: Tomorrow. Phoenix: What if this guy refuses!? Leads to: \"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\" Refuse Phoenix: I'm sorry... I think this is the kind of thing you should really do yourself. Maya: ...You're right. ... Phoenix: Something wrong? Maya: Actually, I asked the police to contact him, and they tried calling a few times. Nobody could get a hold of him! Phoenix: They couldn't find him? Maya: I have no one left to ask! Phoenix: ...? Say, what about your parents...? Maya: ... ... ... Phoenix: O-okay! Don't worry, I'll go ask him for you. Maya: Y-you will? Thank you so much! Phoenix: I'm just worried what will happen if I can't find him. Leads to: \"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\" Maya: They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me. Phoenix: When will that happen? Maya: They're giving me until 4:00 this afternoon. Phoenix: (And visiting hours are almost up... I'd better hurry!) Right, I'll be back! September 6Fey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: (The office is filled with police officers. They're all busily searching for clues...) ???: Hey! You there! This is a crime scene, pal! No trespassing! Umm... Sorry, don't I know you from somewhere? Wait, you're that Butz guy, aren't you! Phoenix: No, no, Phoenix Wright. (How could anyone mistake me for Larry!?) ???: Ah, guess I got the wrong name, Mr. Wright. Sorry 'bout that. That Butz guy, he was a killer! And you're no killer! Right? Phoenix: (He WAS proven innocent...) Umm... right. And you were... Detective Gumshoe Phoenix: Um... Gumshoe, wasn't it? Dick Gumshoe? ???: Right! At your service. Hang on! That's Detective Gumshoe to you, pal! Leads to: \"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\" Detective Suedeshoes Phoenix: Um... Suedeshoes, wasn't it? ???: That's me! Don't step on my blue suede shoes... Wait! That's a song, pal! My name's Dick Gumshoe... W-wait! That's Detective Gumshoe to you, pal! Leads to: \"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\" Detective Gumtree Phoenix: Um... Gumtree, was it? Detective Gumtree? ???: G-Gumtree...? Gum doesn't grow on trees, pal! And I'm the one in charge here so don't push your luck! Phoenix: (Whatever you say, Detective...) Leads to: \"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\" Gumshoe: Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"... Police: Hey, Dick! Get over here! Gumshoe: Y-yes, sir! B-be right there! Umm... ahem! You're her lawyer, right, pal? If you got business here, you'd better do it quick! Phoenix: (Whew! He thinks I'm Maya's lawyer...!) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is that Mia probably read all of these. Houseplant Phoenix: Mia's favorite potted plant. I remember it had this bizarre name no one could ever remember. ???: \"Cordyline stricta,\" pal! Phoenix: (Who was that!?) Mia's desk Phoenix: Mia's desk. Perfectly clean, as always. The only thing it's missing is... Mia. Movie poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it. I'll have to check it out one of these days. Window Phoenix: The sky is blue, and so am I... There's that hotel, right across the way. Talk Mia Phoenix: About Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy? Gumshoe: Hmm? You want to know the results, eh? Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: Now don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all! Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Mia (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, Mia's death was instantaneous. Gumshoe: That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person. Phoenix: You knew her, Detective? Gumshoe: Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all. Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win! Phoenix: W-why do you say that? Gumshoe: The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution! Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) Gumshoe: I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all. Edgeworth (appears after \"Maya\") Phoenix: Prosecutor Edgeworth... Gumshoe: That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!? Of course I do! Phoenix: I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his \"guilty\" verdict. Gumshoe: Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case. Phoenix: (So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...) Leads to: \"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\" Of course not! Phoenix: Never heard of him. Gumshoe: Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him! Phoenix: (Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a \"guilty\" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...) Leads to: \"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\" Phoenix: (All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...) Present The Thinker Phoenix: I was wondering, do you know anything about this? Gumshoe: That statue? That's the murder weapon. Phoenix: (Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.) Glass Shards Phoenix: There was broken glass at the crime scene, right? Gumshoe: Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand. Receipt Phoenix: There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it! Phoenix: Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself? Gumshoe: Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not. Phoenix: (So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.) Maya's Memo Phoenix: I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone? Gumshoe: Oh that? I have that. Phoenix: Do you think you could give it back? Gumshoe: Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer! Phoenix: (Uh-oh, he's on to me!) Tell him straight Phoenix: (Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!) Gumshoe: Something the matter? Phoenix: Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective! Gumshoe: Nope. I know nothing, pal! Phoenix: That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets! Gumshoe: Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory! Phoenix: Impressive! You're quite the detective. Gumshoe: Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all. Leads to: \"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\" Tell him not-so-straight Phoenix: (Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?) Gumshoe: Something the matter? Phoenix: Oh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone... Gumshoe: This? Hmm... it says \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo\"... \"The Steel Samurai\"... that action hero on TV? Phoenix: Yeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct. Gumshoe: That what she said? Phoenix: Um. Yes. Gumshoe: ... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway. Here you go. Leads to: \"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\" Phoenix: (Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...) Maya's Cell Phone received from Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Received: Maya's Cell Phone.] in the original release) Check the Court Record to hear the recorded conversation. Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Thanks for this! Gumshoe: Don't mention it, pal. When it comes to dealing with lawyers, \"fight fair and square,\" is our motto! Phoenix: (I don't know how I feel, seeing everything written up like this... It makes Mia's death seem so... routine.) Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: (Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...) Anything else Gumshoe: Hmm? What's that? Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you! After clearing \"Mia\" and \"Maya\" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo: Phoenix: (I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.) Gumshoe: You all done, pal? Phoenix: Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now. Gumshoe: Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal! Phoenix: ... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness? Gumshoe: Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her! Phoenix: (Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then? Gumshoe: Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial! Phoenix: (So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information. Gumshoe: You got that right, pal! Phoenix: (Time to pay a visit to Miss May!) September 6Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: (According to the receptionist, the big boss is \"out\". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read. Desk Phoenix: A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster. Painting Phoenix: That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter. Potted plant Phoenix: An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available. Table Phoenix: A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn. Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303) Maya: Hey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer? Phoenix: Sorry. I haven't seen him yet. Maya: I see... Phoenix: (Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.) Talk Your family Phoenix: What about your family? Maya: I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is. Phoenix: (Don't know...? So she could still be alive?) Your mother (appears after \"Your family\") Maya: The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life. Phoenix: (\"Ruined\"...?) Maya: After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would \"become a lawyer\" and she left the mountain. Phoenix: ... So, you live by yourself? Maya: Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release) Phoenix: (I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...) Your mother's enemy (appears after \"Your mother\") Phoenix: So, who was this man who, um, \"ruined\" your mother? Maya: About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate... Phoenix: Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they? Maya: The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim. Phoenix: Wow... So, what happened? Maya: The case was solved... we thought. Phoenix: You \"thought\"...? Maya: The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent. Phoenix: ...! Maya: The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation. Phoenix: I see. Maya: ... White... Phoenix: Excuse me? White? Maya: That was his name. My sister told me. Phoenix: White? Hmm... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Hey, I got your cell phone back. Maya: Oh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice? Phoenix: ... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ... Maya: Thank you. September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303 April: Well! Hello there, handsome. Phoenix: Umm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.) April: You're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, \"Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!\" Tee hee! Phoenix: (Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.) April: Gee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness! Phoenix: (I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.) Examine Bed Phoenix: A simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here. Flowers Phoenix: The flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge. Open drawer Leads to: \"There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.\" Painting Phoenix: Ah. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be \"still life\"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall. Table Phoenix: A bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her. Window Phoenix: The late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though. Phoenix: (There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...) April: Hey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you? Phoenix: (Upset!? I thought she was going to explode for a second there! I wonder what could be inside the drawer?) Examine Open drawer Phoenix: (Hmm... what's inside I wonder?) April: *cough* *cough* Phoenix: (Maybe later...) Talk What you witnessed Phoenix: Do you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident. April: Ooh. \"Observe,\" \"incident\"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary. Phoenix: (Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please? April: Let me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer! Phoenix: (Oh boy.) Miss May Phoenix: Um, could you... just who exactly are you? April: Oooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me? Phoenix: N-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here! April: Tee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush. Phoenix: (Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do? April: Well... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you! Phoenix: (Oh boy.) This room Phoenix: I see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you? April: Oooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television! Phoenix: Oh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer! April: Say, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph! Phoenix: (Oh boy.) Present Anything April: Excuse me, but I'm a witness? Police witness? You understand? How could I possibly give you any information in good conscience, hmm? Me... \"the witness\"! It's just like the movie! Grossberg Law Offices (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303) Phoenix: (Hmm... seems like Mr. Grossberg is out. Well, maybe I should just wait here for him to come back.) ???: *Ah-HHHHEM!* Phoenix: (If that wasn't the most over-the-top clearing of the throat I've ever heard!) Grossberg: Ah hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me? Phoenix: Uh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!) Grossberg: Hmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now? Phoenix: Y-yes, well... yes. Grossberg: And what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed! Phoenix: (Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?) Grossberg: Hmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it! Phoenix: Um... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey. Grossberg: ...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on. Phoenix: (Hmm? Why the strange reaction?) Grossberg: A-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible. Phoenix: W-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!? Grossberg: Urk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion. Phoenix: (What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him! What do I tell Maya...?) Talk Your refusal Phoenix: How can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case! Grossberg: Hmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see! Phoenix: But the client is Mia Fey's sister! Grossberg: Hmm... ahem. Phoenix: Mia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands. Grossberg: Yes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye. Phoenix: Creep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere. Grossberg: *grumble*... Think not. Phoenix: Huh? Did you say something? Grossberg: I think not, I said. Phoenix: Wh-what do you mean? Grossberg: I'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy. Phoenix: Why!? Grossberg: I... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you. Phoenix: (What's going on here!?) Mia Phoenix: How did you know Mia Fey...? Grossberg: ... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see. Phoenix: A \"mission\"? Grossberg: You could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one. That painting Phoenix: That's... quite a painting. Grossberg: Ahah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you! Phoenix: (I wasn't interested...) Grossberg: It's not for sale! Phoenix: I'm not buying! (Geez!) Present Anything Grossberg: Very sorry, but I've got nothing to say regarding this matter. Fey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: ... (Looks like Detective Gumshoe has gone home. The police are still keeping themselves busy in the chief's office. No one has time to talk to me. Guess I'll head out.) Examine Houseplant Phoenix: Mia's favorite potted plant. I guess I'll have to water it now... Detention Center (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303, then visitng Grossberg Law Offices) Phoenix: Hmm... Maya's not here. She must be in questioning. They probably won't let her out for a while. Maybe I'd better go talk to that lawyer again. After clearing all Talk options in Grossberg Law Offices: September 6, 3:42 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Hiya. Maya: Oh! You're back! Did you find the lawyer? Phoenix: Um... well... (What do I tell her?) Well, see... (Just be honest!) I... I really don't think you should use that guy. He... didn't seem healthy. He was all skin and bones! Maya: ... What really happened? Phoenix: ... Maya: You don't mean... He refused to help? Phoenix: Urp. Maya: ... I see. I've been abandoned, then. After clearing \"Your mother's enemy\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, if all Talk options have been cleared in Grossberg Law Offices Leads to: \"Just a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess...\" Maya: Just a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess... Phoenix: ... (4:00 PM. Time's up. What should I do? Do I just leave her and go home...?) Go home Phoenix: (There's nothing left here for me to do... She'll be better off with a state-appointed lawyer.) I think I'd better get home now. Maya: Good-bye. Phoenix: It was a few days later when I found out how the story ended. The result of the trial was in the newspaper. \"Guilty.\" I'll probably never meet her again. Did I make the right choice? Will I ever know? Mia... if you can hear me, please, tell me! ... Phoenix: Not! I can't let that happen! I'm not leaving here until she takes me as her lawyer! Leads to: \"I've made up my mind!\" Defend Maya Leads to: \"I've made up my mind!\" Phoenix: I've made up my mind! I'm going to defend you whether you want me to or not! Maya: ! Why? Phoenix: Why? Well... I can't abandon you Phoenix: ... (No one is as sad as a person without any friends. I know... I've been there. A long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) Maya... Leads to: \"I won't abandon you. You can count on me.\" Someone else is the culprit Phoenix: You aren't the culprit! Someone else is! Maya: H-how do you know? Phoenix: I, um, I have a hunch... (Given the evidence, it would be easy to assume that Maya was the killer. But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) Maya... Leads to: \"I won't abandon you. You can count on me.\" I don't know why Phoenix: To be honest, I don't know. Maya: You don't know? Phoenix: (Is this girl sitting in front of me the killer? All the evidence seems to say \"yes.\" But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) There's only one thing I know for certain. Leads to: \"I won't abandon you. You can count on me.\" Phoenix: I won't abandon you. You can count on me. Maya: ... That's so kind of you... *sniff*... ... Phoenix: Well! Let's fight this one and get you out of here! Maya: R-right! Thank you! Phoenix: (Whew, she smiled at last. She looks like an entirely different person!) One last question... You are innocent, right? Maya: Yes! And I trust you... So you trust me, too, okay? Phoenix: It's a deal. (So, what next... There's something that's been bugging me... Just what was inside that strange woman's drawer? It was when I tried to look into the drawer that she got all defensive. There has to be something in there!) Gatewater Hotel Bellboy: Good afternoon, sir! Phoenix: Excuse me, you are...? Bellboy: Ah, I beg your pardon, sir! I am the bellboy of this establishment, at your service, sir. Phoenix: Oh, right. Bellboy: I've just come up to deliver room service, sir. Phoenix: Um... do you know where Miss May might be? Bellboy: Ah. I believe our guest Miss May is currently using the, er, facilities...? If you've no need of anything, I'll be taking my leave. Please, stay as long as you like. Enjoy... Phoenix: Yeah... Wait... no! Hey! ... (Why does it seem like every time I come here, I end up embarrassing myself? Wait... now's my chance to snoop around a bit!) Bellboy: Ah, I almost forgot! Phoenix: Gah! Y-you came back quick! Bellboy: Might I ask you to inform Miss May that there is a message for her? Please tell her that Mr. White, of Bluecorp phoned. Phoenix: Oh, right. Sure. (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? Where have I heard that name?) Maya: White... That was his name. My sister told me. Phoenix: (\"White\" was the name of the guy who ruined Mia and Maya's mother! Could it be a coincidence?) Examine Open drawer Leads to: \"There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer.\" Phoenix: There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer. Now's my chance to see what's inside! ...! What do we have here! A... wiretap? Hmm! What would a woman like her be doing with a thing like this? Wiretap added to the Court Record. Phoenix: There is definitely something suspicious about this \"Miss May\"! Why would she have something like this in her hotel room? There's a story behind all this, I know it! Alright... I'll be using this bit of evidence in tomorrow's trial, that's for sure. For Maya's sake... I'll get to this woman's bottom! Wait... I mean ... you know what I mean. April: Oh, bellboy...? Still there? Phoenix: (Uh oh, time to scram! I look forward to tangoing with you tomorrow, Miss May! In court!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Turnabout Sisters Transcript Transcript (JP) Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 September 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1 Judge: The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey. Edgeworth: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement. Edgeworth: Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor. Judge: I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then. Edgeworth: If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe! Edgeworth: Witness, please state your name and profession to the court. Gumshoe: Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder. Gumshoe: Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here. Edgeworth: And the cause of death? Gumshoe: Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of \"The Thinker\" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir! Judge: The court accepts the statue as evidence. Phoenix: (They're still calling it a \"statue\"...) Floor Plans added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Now, Detective... Gumshoe: Y-yes sir! Edgeworth: You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why? Gumshoe: Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir! Judge: Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this \"hard evidence.\" Witness Testimony -- Maya Fey's Arrest -- Gumshoe: As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene! There were two people there already: The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright. I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey! Why? We had a witness account describing her! The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder! Judge: Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination. Phoenix: Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...) ...whoosh...SMACK! Phoenix: (Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!\" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!) Judge: Something the matter? Phoenix: No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Maya Fey's Arrest -- Gumshoe: As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who did you say you got a call from? Gumshoe: Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene! Phoenix: (Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue. Gumshoe: There were two people there already: Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime? Gumshoe: Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes! Phoenix: Th-that's pretty fast! Gumshoe: Our motto this month is \"quick response\"! That's how I got there before the killer got away! Edgeworth: Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were. Gumshoe: Yes sir! Gumshoe: The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely sure it was us? Gumshoe: Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene! Phoenix: (Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...) Gumshoe: I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why's that? What's your reason? Gumshoe: Why? We had a witness account describing her! Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold on just one second!\" Gumshoe: The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder! Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold on just one second!\" Phoenix: (I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!) Phoenix: Hold on just one second! Gumshoe: Y-yeah? Phoenix: If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had \"hard evidence\" she did it, correct? Gumshoe: Huh? Did... did I say that? Me? Phoenix: I heard you say it! Judge: You did say it. Edgeworth: You said it. Phoenix: Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was \"hard evidence\"!? Gumshoe: Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink... Judge: That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective? Gumshoe: Umm... Phoenix: (Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!) Gumshoe: ... Yes. Phoenix: (Gah!) Gumshoe: Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor! Judge: Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again. Witness Testimony -- Hard Evidence -- Gumshoe: After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes. I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body! On it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood! Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's! Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger! Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name! How you like that? That's my \"hard evidence\"! Judge: Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective. Gumshoe: Y-Your Honor? Judge: Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!? Gumshoe: Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir. Judge: Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Hard Evidence -- Gumshoe: After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And did you find any evidence? Gumshoe: Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part! Phoenix: (I got a bad feeling about this...) Gumshoe: I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it! Gumshoe: Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants? Phoenix: Wh-who? Um... The killer Phoenix: Th-the killer! Anyone can see that! Gumshoe: Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please! Phoenix: She was framed! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence? Phoenix: Ah... (Urk!) Edgeworth: Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright. Gumshoe: Yeah, pal! Phoenix: (Argh...!) Leads to: \"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\" Miss May Phoenix: Well... it could have been the witness, Miss May! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright! Gumshoe: Yeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal! Phoenix: (Argh...!) Leads to: \"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\" I did Phoenix: It... it could have been me! Gumshoe: What! S-so it was you! Phoenix: No, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note? Phoenix: Uh... Edgeworth: Listen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur! Phoenix: (...!) Leads to: \"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\" Edgeworth: Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found. Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: On it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!? Gumshoe: Of course I do, pal! Phoenix: (Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident. This might not be good...) Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What kind of \"tests\" were these again? Gumshoe: Huh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests! Judge: Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony. Gumshoe: Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir. Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Y-yeah? Edgeworth: I think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check. Gumshoe: Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Phoenix: (That was a mess...) Gumshoe: Right! Where was I? Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: On which hand was the bloody finger, Detective? Gumshoe: The right hand! Phoenix: (Hmm... she WAS right handed...) Gumshoe: Hah hah hah! Nice try! Phoenix: (Uh oh... I guess it wasn't too hard to see what I was getting at there.) Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name? Gumshoe: Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies! Phoenix: This isn't a movie, Detective. Gumshoe: Oof! Phoenix: Let's talk about reality, shall we? Gumshoe: Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no. Phoenix: Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister? Gumshoe: Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer! Judge: Order! Order! Phoenix: (That didn't go so well...) Gumshoe: Th-that's right! What he said! Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Phoenix: (That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!) Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying? Gumshoe: Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!? Phoenix: You have it backwards, Detective. Gumshoe: B-backwards? Phoenix: The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. \"Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object.\" She died immediately! Gumshoe: But...! Phoenix: No \"but\"-ing your way out of this one, Detective! Judge: Order! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report? Phoenix: Wh-when...!? The day of the murder Phoenix: I... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder. Gumshoe: You're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after! Phoenix: Oh. Right. Leads to: \"The prosecution's point being...?\" The day after the murder Phoenix: It was the day after the murder... Leads to: \"The prosecution's point being...?\" I forget Phoenix: I'm... sorry, I forgot. Edgeworth: Hah! Forgot, you say? Gumshoe: It was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally! Phoenix: Oh. R-right. Leads to: \"The prosecution's point being...?\" Judge: The prosecution's point being...? Edgeworth: That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor. Phoenix: Wh-what!? Edgeworth: A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! \"Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow.\" I received these results this morning. Phoenix: N-no way! Edgeworth: Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write \"Maya\"! That is all. Judge: I see! Phoenix: (Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!) Edgeworth: Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say? You're a sham, Edgeworth! Phoenix: Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report? Judge: Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution! Edgeworth: No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable. Leads to: \"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\" The detective's a sham! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!? Gumshoe: Huh? I-I thought... Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Urp! Edgeworth: I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that. Gumshoe: Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir. Edgeworth: You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month. Gumshoe: W-what? B-but... *sigh* Leads to: \"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\" I'm a sham! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe. Are you calling me a fool because I believed your report? Gumshoe: Huh? Me? I-I'm not... huh? Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Urp! Edgeworth: I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that. Gumshoe: Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir. Edgeworth: You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month. Gumshoe: W-what? B-but... *sigh* Leads to: \"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\" Edgeworth: Your Honor, I submit this report to the court. Judge: U-understood. The court accepts the evidence. Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record. Edgeworth: Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer. Judge: I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes. Phoenix: (Darn! This isn't good!) Edgeworth: The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes! Judge: Let the witness Miss April May take the stand. Phoenix: (Exactly what part of her is \"innocent\"...?) Edgeworth: Witness, your name, please. April: April May! At your service! *wink* Judge: Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking! ([wanton] misspelled as [wonton] in the original release) April: Aww... Yes, Your Honor. Phoenix: (This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!) Edgeworth: Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred? April: Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch. Edgeworth: And this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices? April: Mmm... that's right, big boy. Judge: Please testify to the court about what you saw. Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- April: It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know! And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked! The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair! Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away! But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her! Then the woman with long hair... She kinda... slumped. The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink* Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: Well, Your Honor? Judge: I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any... Phoenix: W-wait, Your Honor! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: What about my cross-examination!? Judge: I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you? Edgeworth: Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies... Phoenix: H-hey! How dare you! Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness? Yes, I'm doing it Phoenix: I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!) Leads to: \"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!\" No thanks Phoenix: No... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point. Edgeworth: Heh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case! Phoenix: (Wh-what? That's it!?) Judge: Very well. Phoenix: W-wait! Hold on! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness? Phoenix: Yes yes yes! (I'd better, or I'll lose on the spot!) Leads to: \"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!\" Judge: Very well, you may begin your cross-examination! Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- April: It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why did you do that? April: Huh? \"Why\"? Like, why what? Phoenix: Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something? April: Oh, well, um... gee! Phoenix: (What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!) April: I sort of, y'know. I had a feeling! Phoenix: (Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question! Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?) Go for it Phoenix: (Let's see how far I can run with this...) Surely, you must have had a reason to look out your window at that time of night! April: I... oooh! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness! Phoenix: B-badgering? Edgeworth: You insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed. (Yeah! Yeah! Stop him!) (The poor girl!) Judge: Order! Mr. Wright, you have been warned. Phoenix: (Poor girl!? What about poor me!?) Leads to: \"You looked out the window. What did you see next?\" Back down Phoenix: (If I go too deep, I might not come back out alive... I'll back off for now.) Leads to: \"You looked out the window. What did you see next?\" Edgeworth: You looked out the window. What did you see next? April: And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The woman with long hair... that was Mia Fey? April: Um-hmm! Slender, sort of, well, some people might say pretty, if that's your thing. Phoenix: (Your... thing?) Edgeworth: And the person attacking her? April: The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How do you know she was the defendant? April: Huh? Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay? Edgeworth: There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor. Phoenix: (He's right...) Yep, he's right Phoenix: (Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.) Edgeworth: So then, tell us what happened to the victim. Leads back to cross-examination I question the testimony Leads to: \"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!\" April: Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She \"dodged\"? Dodged what!? April: Well... the attack! Edgeworth: Please, continue your testimony. April: But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How did you know it was my client!? April: Huh? Well, I... gee! First of all, she had a girl's physique! And, and secondly, she was... she was small! Who else could it be but her! Phoenix: (She has a point...) You're right Phoenix: (Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one. Maybe I should just listen to the testimony again.) Leads back to cross-examination I question your testimony Leads to: \"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!\" Phoenix: (Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!) Phoenix: Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks! April: W-what!? Phoenix: Miss May, I'm willing to bet that... You saw nothing Phoenix: Did you really see the defendant at all!? Leads to: \"Urp!\" You're lying Phoenix: Are you telling the truth? Did you really see the defendant!? Leads to: \"Urp!\" April: Urp! Judge: Mr. Wright! What's the meaning of this? April: Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean! Phoenix: Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique! April: ...! Phoenix: No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus! April: But... but! Judge: Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder... Phoenix: She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May? April: Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling. Judge: Miss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony. April: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink* Judge: Your testimony again, if you would. Phoenix: (Damn, I almost had her!) Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- April: I did see everything! I did! The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right. Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her... And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did! That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think? Well? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee! Judge: I... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- April: I did see everything! I did! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you saw me then, too? April: Of course! I'd remember that spiky hair anywhere! Phoenix: (Spiky...?) Judge: The witness will refrain from personal attacks on the defense attorney. April: Aww, was I a bad girl? I'm sowwy. Judge: Very well... continue. April: The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is that \"right\" as in your right, as you looked from the hotel? April: Um... which hand do I hold my knife in again...? Right! It was my right hand! Right? Edgeworth: Satisfied, Mr. Wright? Please continue. April: Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How convenient for you to remember her \"hippie\" clothes! April: That's what you--I mean, that's what she was wearing! Oh, and her hair was all done up like a bun! Phoenix: (*sigh*...) Judge: What happened then? April: And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where did this weapon come from? April: She picked it up from the desk! Judge: I see. What sort of weapon was it? April: That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A... clock? (Didn't this come up in another testimony recently...?) April: W-well? Don't look so sour, Mr. Lawyer. You can't win them all. Phoenix: (No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!) Present The Thinker Phoenix: Leads to: \"Miss May.\" Phoenix: (Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.) Phoenix: Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing. April: Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer... Phoenix: You just said that this statue of \"The Thinker\" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it! April: Urp! Phoenix: Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a \"clock,\" too... And he was found guilty... of murder! Judge: Order! Order! Phoenix: Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock? April: Oooh... urp! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns! Judge: Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...) Judge: ... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness. Phoenix: (Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!) April: Huh? What? So... what happens now? Phoenix: What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock? April: What...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time! Phoenix: So, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.! April: N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee! Edgeworth: The law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock! Judge: Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied? Phoenix: No, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because... She couldn't have heard it Phoenix: You were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You have proof that she could not? Phoenix: Uh... Edgeworth: Amateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing. Phoenix: Then I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard... Edgeworth: The prosecution denies your request! Phoenix: Wh-what!? On what grounds? Edgeworth: This is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand! Judge: Indeed. Objection sustained. Phoenix: (Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!) Judge: Ready to proceed, Mr. Wright? Leads back to: \"No, Your Honor!\" It couldn't have rung Leads to: \"Your Honor, members of the court...\" Phoenix: Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang! It's empty Phoenix: That clock is missing its clockwork! Judge: H-how could you possibly...? Phoenix: Just have a look... Right now! (Changed from [Just have a look... As soon as you can!] in the original release) Judge: ... Oh! Phoenix: See anything interesting, Your Honor? Judge: It is as the defense says! Leads to: \"This clock is missing its clockwork!\" It's broken Phoenix: I-I think it's broken! That clock's busted! Judge: You \"think\"? Phoenix: J-just look at it! Your Honor, please examine the clock! Judge: Hmm... Oh! Phoenix: See anything interesting, Your Honor? Judge: Well, I'm not sure I would call this \"broken,\" but I doubt it could ring...! Leads to: \"This clock is missing its clockwork!\" The batteries are dead Phoenix: The batteries on that clock must be dead! Judge: \"Must be,\" Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Your Honor, if you would inspect the clock...! Judge: Hmm... very well. ... Oh! Phoenix: Well, Your Honor? Are they...? Judge: This clock has graver problems than dead batteries! Leads to: \"This clock is missing its clockwork!\" Judge: This clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this? Phoenix: It is as you can see. The \"clock\" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar! April: F-fat!? Phoenix: Well, Miss May? Edgeworth: Tsk tsk. Phoenix: ? Edgeworth: Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!) Edgeworth: I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction! Judge: ! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it. Edgeworth: And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor! Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed? Edgeworth: Ho hoh! Impossible, of course... Phoenix: I have proof. Edgeworth: W-what!? Phoenix: Wasn't it you who told me \"proof is everything\"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the \"proof\" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Leads to: \"Take a look at this!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you say to that? April: W-what? I don't rightly understand what that's supposed to mean! Judge: I don't rightly understand either. Edgeworth: Ho hoh! Phoenix: (Uh oh... I think I blew it.) Judge: Mr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future. Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor! Leads back to: \"The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...\" Phoenix: Take a look at this! Judge: Hmm. That's a very cute cell phone. April: Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone! Phoenix: W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder! Judge: Order! Order! Edgeworth: The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention! Phoenix: Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it? Edgeworth: *grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...) Phoenix: (I gotta say, I'm starting to feel bad for the big fella.) (Changed from [My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.] in the original release) Let's hear the conversation. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [So you just want me to hold on to \"The Thinker\" for you, then?] Mia: [If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.] Maya: [Huh? It's not working? That's lame!] Mia: [I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.] ...[September 5, 9:27 AM] Cellular: *beep* Phoenix: Your Honor, I think this makes it clear the clockwork was already gone by the time this was recorded, (Changed from [I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone...] in the original release) which was well before the witness even arrived at her hotel! (Changed from [and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!] in the original release) April: Muh... muh... muh!? Phoenix: Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!? April: ... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink* Judge: So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright? Yes Leads to: \"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\" No Phoenix: Oh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!) Judge: Then, the court would like-- Phoenix: Hold on! P-please wait, Your Honor! Judge: Y-yes...? So you do have an objection? Phoenix: Um, yes, well... Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Sorry, Your Honor, it's just... Leads to: \"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\" Phoenix: The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\" But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court! Judge: Well then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before. Present The Thinker Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's simple.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here is undeniable proof! Edgeworth: Hah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece! Judge: Hmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind? Leads back to: \"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.\" Phoenix: It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever! April: W-whaaat!? Phoenix: A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody! April: I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores! Phoenix: Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...? April: Mmpf... Phoenix: Oh? Excuses not on sale today? April: Oooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die! Judge: W-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm! April: Hrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink* Phoenix: (S-scary...) Judge: Miss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock? April: ... Judge: Hmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior? Phoenix: (Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because... You held it Phoenix: (This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands! Judge: Mr. Wright! When was this!? Phoenix: When she used it to strike the victim! When else? Judge: Order! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!? Phoenix: April May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made \"The Thinker\" ring! That's when you heard it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: W-what's that supposed to mean!? Edgeworth: It was you who just proved that \"The Thinker\" was empty! Phoenix: Oh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!) Edgeworth: What's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder. Phoenix: (S-she can't prove it! She did it!) April: It would be MY pleasure! Phoenix: N-no way! April: Yes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy! Edgeworth: Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid! Judge: Mr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman! Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know \"The Thinker\" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof! Judge: Well... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock? Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Phoenix: The defendant's cell phone. Judge: Yes, we've seen that already. Phoenix: Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.] Mia: [Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.] Maya: [Again? What's it this time?] Mia: [It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!] ... Judge: They do mention \"The Thinker.\" But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation? Present Wiretap Phoenix: Leads to: \"Have a look at this.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!) Judge: Mr. Wright! Your evidence, please! Leads back to: \"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\" Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!? April: I... I... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is ridiculous! Phoenix: Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer. April: La... laaa... lrrrrgf! Judge: Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone? April: ... Judge: Miss May! April: Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER! ...... April: I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!) You did it, didn't you? Phoenix: Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you? April: Are you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Why the wiretap? Phoenix: Miss May... Why did you tap her phone? April: ... Phoenix: Answer the question! April: Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant? Phoenix: (Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that \"irrelevant\"! Judge: While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone? April: At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Present Wiretap Phoenix: Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not? April: Oooh. Oooooh! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is irrelevant! Judge: I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap. Edgeworth: This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone? Phoenix: Absolutely! Edgeworth: Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT! Phoenix: Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple! Edgeworth: WHAAAAT!? Phoenix: Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Leads to: \"I present the defendant's cell phone.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This! I think... Judge: That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think... Phoenix: W-wait! That was just a warm up! Judge: Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time! Leads back to: \"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\" Phoenix: I present the defendant's cell phone. Judge: Yes, we've seen that. Phoenix: Listen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.] Mia: [Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.] Maya: [Again? What's it this time?] Mia: [It's... a clock.

If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence reveals the truth of the matter! Judge: What does it reveal, exactly? Edgeworth: The mad delusions of the defense, perhaps? Phoenix: (Uh oh, bad reaction. Maybe that wasn't the thing...) Judge: I'm afraid it has revealed a certain over-eagerness... Let me ask again: Leads back to: \"How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock?\" You had heard about it Phoenix: The witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock! Judge: She \"heard\"...? Phoenix: That is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known \"The Thinker\" was a clock! And I can show you the proof! Judge: Well, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had \"heard\" the murder weapon was a clock. Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Phoenix: The defendant's cell phone. Judge: Yes, we've seen that already. Phoenix: Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.] Mia: [Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.] Maya: [Again?

Present Wiretap Phoenix: Leads to: \"Have a look at this.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!) Judge: Mr. Wright! Your evidence, please! Leads back to: \"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\" Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation!

Phoenix: Miss May! April: What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!? Phoenix: You killed her, didn't you! Judge: Order! There will be order! April: What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops! Phoenix: So you admit you tapped her phone! April: Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl! Phoenix: Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!) April: You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will! Phoenix: You can't be serious! No way! April: Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy... Phoenix: R-room service!? April: Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee. Phoenix: I-ice coffee...!? April: Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink* Edgeworth: Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder! Phoenix: ! Judge: So, where does that leave us...? Edgeworth: It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder! Phoenix: (No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...) Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Why the wiretap? Phoenix: Why did you tap her phone?

You were probably thinking \"I'd like to see her pull THAT off,\" weren't you! Phoenix: (Damn... she's good!) April: Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will! Phoenix: You can't be serious! No way! April: Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night?

Judge: I'm afraid I'm not sure where you are going with all of this, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Um... \"where\"? Well, it's not so much a place as a... er... Edgeworth: Come to the end of your bluff, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: W-wait! Wait! That was, uh, practice! Here's the real evidence! Judge: Mr. Wright, this court does not condone the presentation of evidence for \"practice.\" Let's see your evidence, for real this time, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"Show me evidence proving that the witness had \"heard\" the murder weapon was a clock.\" Judge: Well, does the defense have anything to say? Phoenix: Um, well... (Come on, think of something!) Call the bellboy as a witness Phoenix: The defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it! April: I think you've sunken quite low enough already. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I object to calling the bellboy! Phoenix: W-why? What's your reason? Edgeworth: Because I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing! Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: However... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness. Phoenix: Condition...? Edgeworth: If Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of \"guilty\" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition. Phoenix: (What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared \"guilty\" on the spot! What should I do...?) Accept the condition Phoenix: (Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition. Edgeworth: Hmph. Fool... You fell right into my trap! Phoenix: (Uh oh!) Uh... um, wait... Leads to: \"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\" Give up Phoenix: (Grr! I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness. Judge: I see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Right. On with the cross-examination. Edgeworth: What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection! Phoenix: (Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!) Judge: Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call? Edgeworth: None, Your Honor. She's the last. Phoenix: (What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The defense would like to call the bellboy after all! Edgeworth: ... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought! Phoenix: ...? Edgeworth: May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced \"guilty\"! Are you prepared to accept my condition? Phoenix: (Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept! Leads to: \"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\" Continue examining Miss May Phoenix: Right. On with the cross-examination. Edgeworth: What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection! Phoenix: (Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!) Judge: Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?

Phoenix: (Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept! Leads to: \"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\" Judge: Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand! Edgeworth: I believe we're ready for the witness to testify. He certainly does look like a bellboy. Bellboy: Yes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service. Judge: That tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado, the witness may begin his testimony. Bellboy: Very good, sir! Witness Testimony -- Miss May's Room Service -- Bellboy: I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations! I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May. She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir. I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course. And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself. Judge: I see. The defense may begin its cross-examination. Phoenix: R-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!) Cross Examination -- Miss May's Room Service -- Bellboy: I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What exactly is it you do at the hotel? Bellboy: Why, anything required of me, sir. I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally. Phoenix: Are you always so... so prim? Judge: Mr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions... Bellboy: I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure it was Miss May on the phone? Bellboy: Absolutely, sir. Phoenix: H-how can you be so certain!? Bellboy: I checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir. Judge: Yes, what then? Bellboy: She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: 9:00 \"on the dot,\" you say? Bellboy: Yes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir. Phoenix: (9:00... the time of the murder!) Bellboy: I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Precisely\" 9:00, then? Bellboy: Precisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM. Phoenix: How can you be so sure!? Bellboy: Miss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. \"Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!\" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir. Phoenix: (Why would she be so particular about the time?) Bellboy: And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You are sure it was Miss April May herself? Bellboy: Ab-SO-lutely, sir. Phoenix: \"Ab-SO-lutely\"...? Bellboy: Yes, sir. As in, \"so very absolutely,\" sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine. Phoenix: How come you're so very certain!? Bellboy: Well, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an \"embrasser,\" sir. Phoenix: \"Embrasser\"!? Is that French for \"embrace\"? Bellboy: It's French for \"kiss,\" sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek. Phoenix: Wh-why would she have done that...? Bellboy: I believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir. Phoenix: (Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!) Phoenix: (This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!) After pressing fourth and fifth statements: Phoenix: ... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?) Edgeworth: Tsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here! Judge: Hmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand. Phoenix: (I can't let this happen... can I?) Protest Leads to: \"W-wait! Please wait!\" Give up Phoenix: (No...! If I give up now, I lose everything... If I just give up the case, I'd be giving up the very reason I became a lawyer!) Leads to: \"W-wait! Please wait!\" Phoenix: W-wait! Please wait! Judge: Yes? Does the defense have something to add? Phoenix: One last question... let me ask one last question! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough! Judge: Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all. Phoenix: (Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?) Check-in Phoenix: T-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May. Bellboy: Oh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really. Phoenix: I see...¬†? Excuse me... what exactly was a \"disappointment\"? Bellboy: Well, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there. Phoenix: (...! What did he say!?) What did you say!? Bellboy: Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite! Phoenix: Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person? Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I object! That was... objectionable!\" Room service Phoenix: T-tell me again about er... room service! Bellboy: A-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall. Phoenix: I see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive? Bellboy: Y-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir. Phoenix: (...! What did he say!?) What did you say!? Bellboy: Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite! Phoenix: Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room? Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I object! That was... objectionable!\" Bed making Phoenix: Bed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day. Edgeworth: I was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low! Judge: Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question. Bellboy: Yes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see. Phoenix: I see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say? Bellboy: Eh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir? Phoenix: Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room? Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I object! That was... objectionable!\" Edgeworth: I object! That was... objectionable! Judge: ... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question. Bellboy: Er... yes, I see. Phoenix: Why did you not mention this in your testimony!? Bellboy: W-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask! Phoenix: (Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention! Bellboy: Ah, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who... Phoenix: ! Bellboy: He asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir. Edgeworth: Oof! Y-you fool! Phoenix: I've done it... I've won! Phoenix: Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct? Bellboy: Yes, sir. Phoenix: Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...? Bellboy: That's right, sir. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: And who, Mr. Wright! Who is this \"other person\"! (Changed from [Who! Who is this 'other person'!] in the original release) Phoenix: Simple, it was... Miss April May Phoenix: None other than Miss April May! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Eh!? Have you heard nothing that has transpired so far!? She has an alibi! She was in the hotel at the time of the murder! Phoenix: Oh... right. Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance! Leads back to: \"Simple, it was...\" The man with Miss May Leads to: \"The man who checked in with Miss May!\" The Bellboy Phoenix: It was the bellboy and none other! Judge: Well, this comes as some surprise... Edgeworth: Your Honor, Mr. Wright... It was the bellboy who confirmed Miss May's alibi... And this in turn confirms the bellboy's alibi! He was in the hotel! Phoenix: Well, s-sure... if you put it that way... Edgeworth: I do put it that way, and I trust you will too! Phoenix: But what if they were in cahoots! Judge: You have evidence of this? Phoenix: Um... no, Your Honor. Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance! Leads back to: \"Simple, it was...\" Phoenix: The man who checked in with Miss May! Edgeworth: Oof! Phoenix: Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!! Edgeworth: M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late... Phoenix: \"Too late\"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court! Edgeworth: Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous! Judge: Enough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood? Edgeworth: Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor. Judge: That is all today for the trial of Maya Fey. Court is adjourned! September 7, 2:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Maya: Mr. Wright! You were amazing in there! Phoenix: R-really? Maya: I think I might be your newest fan! Phoenix: Oh, I was just \"doing my job\" you know... heh heh. Maya: Then again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too... Phoenix: Huh? Maya: That face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine! Phoenix: Hmm... if you say so. Maya: So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now? Phoenix: Um, well... (Changed from [Well, no.] in the original release) No, I don't think so. Not yet. (Changed from [I don't think so. Not yet.] in the original release) Maya: Oh... I see. Phoenix: But I got a great lead in today's trial! Maya: A \"lead\"? Phoenix: That man with Miss May! He's the key! Maya: Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway? Phoenix: I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed. Maya: Yes sir! Phoenix: I'm going to find out more about this man. Maya: Do you think he was the one who...? Phoenix: Maybe so. Maya: Sis... Phoenix: Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise. Maya: I'm counting on you! Phoenix: I asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that hasn't been stricken from the record. (Changed from [In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.] in the original release) May Testimony added to the Court Record. Phoenix: I don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to set her free! (Changed from [Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to get her free!] in the original release) To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory. Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow? Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Maya Fey... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Turnabout Sisters Transcript Transcript (JP) Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 September 7, 3:11 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room April: Well hello! I didn't expect anyone to visit me in such a dank place as this... It's really quite... moving. Not! You stinking lawyer! I hope you die! Have you come to laugh? Yes, laugh at the fallen Miss May! Phoenix: No, not really, there's something I wanted to ask. April: Unfortunately, there is nothing I want to BE asked. Haven't you done enough questioning, you...! Spiky-head! Phoenix: (Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the security guard. April: ... So? What is it you wish to ask of me, then? Hmm? Phoenix: (For starters, how did you get to be so totally whacked!?) Examine Security camera Phoenix: Smile for the camera... Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Or maybe he just doesn't get to see a lot of women like Miss May in here. Talk That \"man\" Phoenix: About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... April: ... Phoenix: Can you tell me about him? Where is he? C'mon... April: No way, Jose. Phoenix: (Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...) The wiretap Phoenix: Why did you place a wiretap on Mia's phone? April: Aww, when you say it like that it sounds so... cold. So criminal! Phoenix: Um... tapping people's phones is a crime, Miss May. April: Oh, and I suppose you learned that in Lawyer School, hmm? Creep! Phoenix: (This woman is impossible to talk to...) Your attitude Phoenix: Say... Why are you so... angry? I mean, you don't look like a bad person... April: Ooh, that does it! Bottom-feeding, scum-sucking lawyer! Phoenix: B-bottom...? (I can't tell, does she have a thing against lawyers... or just against me?) Present Anything April: Hey, guess what. Actually, I, um, really hate your guts. So get lost. Because, well, I'm not cooperating. Phoenix: (Thanks, I noticed.) September 7Fey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Looks like forensics is taking the day off today. Detective Gumshoe's nowhere in sight. The police really gave this place a working over. I doubt there are any valuable clues left. Suppose it can't hurt to take a look around, though. Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. All the cases that the chief worked on are filed here. Hmm. Are some of the files missing...? Nah, I'm imagining things. September 7Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: (Huh. Looks like Grossberg is out today... again. Maybe he's avoiding me for some reason?) Examine Photos on desk Phoenix: What's this? Old photos? There are two lying here. Something's been written in pencil on the backs. \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A,\" \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B\"... Let's take a look at these... \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A\" Phoenix: ... I'm sure I've seen this person somewhere... Perhaps I'll borrow this photo. I'm sure no one will miss just one little photo. And it might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. Photograph quietly added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B\" Phoenix: Why would Grossberg have a picture of this man...? This might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. I'm just borrowing it. I'll return it later. Photograph quietly added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination Leave them alone Phoenix: I don't need it now, whatever it is. If I ever run out of clues, I'll know where to find these. (Although I can't be sure the photos will still be here then...) Leads back to examination Photos on desk (after one has been added to the Court Record) Phoenix: A photo lies on the desk. Maybe I should switch it with the one I took? Swap photos Phoenix: I think I'll swap them... Photograph added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination Leave it alone Phoenix: No, on second thought, I'd better not. Leads back to examination Vacant wall Phoenix: Wait a second... Wasn't there a giant painting hanging on that wall...? Yeah... yeah, it was a painting of... Sunflowers Leads to: \"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.\" Marvin Grossberg Leads to: \"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.\" Fishermen Leads to: \"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.\" Phoenix: Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow. Detention Center (after visiting Grossberg Law Offices) April: YOU AGAIN!? Can't you take a hint and stay gone? Phoenix: Hey, the only reason I'm back here is because YOU won't talk to me! April: Oh, so it's MY fault now? You don't just have spiky hair, you also have a spiky heart. Phoenix: (That does it. When this case is done I'm shaving my head.) Talk That \"man\" Phoenix: About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... Can you tell me about him? Where is he? April: I'm not telling! Phoenix: Look, he's being accused of murder! I don't think you want to be protecting him. April: Hmm. Would you have sold out the late Ms. Fey to the cops? Phoenix: No. April: See? Phoenix: (Damn! Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...) Present Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A) Phoenix: Any thoughts about this photograph? April: ... Who's that? Your mother? Phoenix: (... *sigh* Looks like I've just been wasting my time.) Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Look, I've said several times, I'm not telling you...¬†! Where did you...? Phoenix: (Ah hah! A reaction!) This is him, isn't it? April: What? Who? When? Why...? Phoenix: It IS him. This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder! April: No! No, that's not right. Phoenix: (Nice try, Miss Cooperative.) April: D-do you have proof that was him? Hmm? Y-yeah! Proof! Show me proof! Phoenix: (I'm so close!) September 7Gatewater HotelRoom 303 Bellboy: Ah, welcome, sir! Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself. Phoenix: Oh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that. Bellboy: No, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's \"rep,\" as they say. Phoenix: Huh? \"Rep\"? Bellboy: Yes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir! Phoenix: Whoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder. Bellboy: I, too, will become famous! \"The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee\"...! Phoenix: (Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...) Bellboy: So! You are our honored guest. Please let me know if there is anything I can bring you! Examine Flowers Phoenix: A vase, as expected. I'm not good with flower names, except maybe tulips and sunflowers. Open drawer Phoenix: Huh? There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer! Bellboy: Ah, please leave that as it is, sir. That's the \"Drawer of Terror, Hiding Place of the Murderer's Wiretap.\" It's set to become one of the most popular attractions here. Phoenix: (This guy's serious! I don't believe it...) Table Phoenix: A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. Why hasn't he cleaned these up by now? Bellboy: Ah, I beg your pardon, sir, but if you could please refrain from touching those... It's part of the decor. I call it: \"The last drink... before murder!\" We'll be famous! The talk of the hotel industry! Window Phoenix: Nice weather again today. I can see the Fey & Co. Law Offices, of course. Bellboy: Ah, yes. We plan to install a telescope in that window, of course. Just $5.00 will earn you three minutes of a \"view to a kill\"! Phoenix: ... Bellboy: J-just kidding, sir. Oh hoh hoh hoh! Phoenix: (By that look in his eyes I'd say he was more than serious...) Talk Miss May Phoenix: About Miss May... Bellboy: Oh, her? Sir, not to boast but I knew the moment I saw her... \"She'd do it!\" I said! Phoenix: (Do WHAT!? I'm starting to think the most suspicious person here is this guy!) The man with May Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about the man who was with Miss May...? Bellboy: Ah, yes... He struck me as a real \"Lady Killer,\" if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger. Phoenix: (There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.) Bellboy: If you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him. Phoenix: (A photo. Hmm...) The hotel Phoenix: Could you tell me about this hotel? Bellboy: Absolutely! And on that subject, I have an excellent idea, sir! Currently, this hotel is known as the \"Gatewater.\" I propose that we add a subtitle! Phoenix: A subtitle!? Bellboy: The Gatewater Hotel -- Murder Manor -- Well? What do you think? Phoenix: Um... sounds great! (Whatever floats your tea set...) Present Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A) Phoenix: What about this photo? Bellboy: Well, it's a fine photo, sir. However, the person Miss May was accompanied by was, well, a man. Phoenix: (Oh... yeah. Right.) Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) Phoenix: Take a look at this photo. Bellboy: ... That's him, Detective. Phoenix: Um... I'm the lawyer. Bellboy: Oh, I know that! I just wanted to say \"Detective\" once. You know how it is. Phoenix: (No. No I don't.) Bellboy: Without a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him! Phoenix: An affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...) Have him write it Phoenix: Well, sure. Why not? Bellboy: Yes! I've always wanted to write an affidavit, sir. From hence forth I will be known as \"The Bellboy who swore the affidavit\"! (Changed from [From hence forth I will be known as the 'bellboy who swore the affidavit'!] in the original release) Phoenix: Just hurry up and write it. Bellboy's Affidavit added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (Not even Miss May can play dumb to this!) Leads back to Court Record Turn him down Phoenix: Well thanks, but I don't think that will be necessary. Bellboy: Oh? Oh, I see. Well later then, if you need it. Leads back to Court Record Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (after Bellboy's Affidavit is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Sorry to press the matter, but are you sure this is him? Bellboy: I, too, am sorry to press the matter, but that is him, Detective! Phoenix: Umm... thanks. Bellboy's Affidavit Phoenix: Thanks for this. Bellboy: No no no, not at all, sir! I hope you'll use it to take that Miss May down hard, sir! Hard! Phoenix: (Why do I sense an unhealthy level of excitement behind that unchanging smile? His tea set is rattling!) Anything else Bellboy: I'm sorry... All I could think about during the trial was the hotel... I wasn't paying much attention to the evidence. Grossberg Law Offices (after Bellboy's Affidavit is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: (*sigh* He's out again? Huh? No more photos on the desk...) Detention Center Present Bellboy's Affidavit Phoenix: Could you have a look at this? April: What's that? Phoenix: The bellboy's affidavit! He told us everything he saw. He told us about the man you checked in with. He told us who he was. April: ...! Phoenix: (Now I'm getting somewhere!) Ease her fears Phoenix: (Okay, okay... she's vulnerable now. I should be gentle.) Miss May... It would be easy for me to hand this affidavit to the police. April: ... Phoenix: If they get involved, wouldn't your boss be even more... er... inconvenienced? All I want to do is have a little chat with him. You won't tell me? April: ... Is that all you have to say? Phoenix: Yes. April: Id it's so easy for you to \"get the police involved,\" then why don't you? Somehow I think you're not up to it, hmm? Phoenix: (Show them a little kindness and they jump all over you! That had the opposite effect to what I hoped...) April: Aww. *smirk* Poor little lawyer... And you were so close! Phoenix: (This isn't working... I think I've worn out this piece of paper's usefulness.) Dammit! Bellboy's Affidavit discarded. (Changed from [Discarded the Bellboy's Affidavit.] in the original release) Phoenix: (The man in this photo is the one I want! Why did April May not want to talk about it... she must know him!) Leads back to Court Record Push her hard Phoenix: (This is it, all or nothing! Time to do a little bluff.) No use playing dumb! (If, indeed, that's an act.) If you don't talk, I'm taking this photo to the press! April: Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: Even though he should've been witness to murder, your little \"friend\" is missing. (Changed from [Even though he should be a witness to murder, this man is in hiding.] in the original release) I'm sure the press would have a field day with his reputation! April: ...! Ooooh! Fine! I'll talk! You... you win, Lawyer. Phoenix: (Yes! Man, that felt good! It's great to be alive!) April: Why are you pumping your fists in the air? Phoenix: *cough* Now, tell me about the man you were with. April: That man... He's my boss. Redd White, the president of the information gathering conglomerate, Bluecorp. Phoenix: (Redd... White?) \"Information gathering?\" April: Well... I suppose you could call it a detective agency. (Changed from [Well... I suppose you could call them a detective agency.] in the orignal release) Phoenix: Hmm... So this is the man that was with you the night of the murder? April: ... I'm... I'm scared to talk. I don't want to end up like her! Phoenix: (...!) It's okay, I'll just ask Mr. White himself. Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located? April: ... Phoenix: (Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! If April May couldn't have done it, that leaves him! Time to take action!) Bellboy's Affidavit discarded. (Changed from [Discarded the Bellboy's Affidavit.] in the original release) Leads back to Court Record Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (after presenting Bellboy's Affidavit) Phoenix: How about this photograph? April: You're wasting your time! Miss May's lips are sealed! Gatewater Hotel (after presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: Hmm. The bellboy seems to be out. Huh? The sound of water coming from the shower... Bellboy: \"La-dee-da! Money-Makin'... Money-Makin'... I got the Money-Makin' bluuuues...\" Phoenix: Someone seems to enjoy washing the showers. Examine Open drawer Phoenix: The screwdriver is still stuck in the drawer. I'd better not touch it. No telling what the bellboy would do to me. Table Phoenix: A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. I'd better not touch them. No telling what the bellboy would do to me. Grossberg Law Offices (after presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: (Alright, this is getting ridiculous. Where the heck is that loafer?) Grossberg: *Ah-HHHHEM!* Phoenix: (Ah, that old familiar clearing of the throat...) Grossberg: Ah hah! You again. Phoenix: Um, hello, Mr. Grossberg. Grossberg: ... Well, well. You were quite the thing, my boy. Phoenix: Excuse me...? Grossberg: The trial! The trial! Phoenix: (He was there...?) Grossberg: Reminded me of myself when I was a youth! Phoenix: (I guess something got passed down through Mia... maybe?) Grossberg: It brings back memories, it does! \"Ah... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon...\" you see. ... I apologize. Phoenix: ? Grossberg: I... It was all a bit too much for me, my boy. Seeing you today, I... well, I... ... Phoenix: (I appreciate the reminiscing, but I'd much rather you gave me some information!) Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So you came to see the trial? Grossberg: Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see. I couldn't get a wink of sleep. Phoenix: Really? What was that? Grossberg: Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl. Phoenix: (If you were that worried about it, why didn't you offer to defend her!?) Your refusal Phoenix: I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know. Grossberg: A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy. Phoenix: ... (He does seem troubled about something... Maybe I can find something that will inspire him to talk.) That painting Phoenix: The other day I'm sure there was a big, pretentious-looking painting on that wall... Grossberg: \"Pretentious-looking\"...? Phoenix: Well... you know the one I mean. Anyway, where did it go? Grossberg: Ah, yes, well... I... got rid of it. Got quite tired of the thing, really. I, er, sold it, you see. Yes, that's right. Phoenix: (Sold it!? I'm not sure I buy that...) Wasn't that painting rather important to you, sir? Did something happen? Grossberg: I don't see how it's any of your business! Please, speak no more of that accursed painting. I didn't... I... *mumble* *mumble* Any option (after presenting Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)) Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg...? Grossberg: ... Ah, my apologies. I need to think about things. Alone. Phoenix: (He barely even glanced in my direction...) Present Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (if \"Ease her fears\" was selected upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph... Grossberg: ...! Where did you get that!? Phoenix: I borrowed it. Grossberg: Well, give it back at once! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg. Tell me about the man in this photo. He may have been in that hotel room with April May on the night of the murder. Do you know something about him... anything? Grossberg: ...! Hmm. Ahem! Very well. I'll tell you what I know. However... You didn't hear it from me, if you follow. Phoenix: I follow. Grossberg: That man is Mr. Redd White. He's the President of Bluecorp. Phoenix: (Redd White... Hmm.) Bluecorp... they're something like a detective agency, right? Grossberg: They're information pros. They sell information, you see. Sensitive information. Despite his name, Mr. White has the blackest reputation of any man in this country. Should you run across him, watch what you say. You wouldn't want him digging up any dirt on you. Phoenix: (Hmm... selling information. Sounds like blackmail.) Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located? Grossberg: Hmm... I suppose. Phoenix: (Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! Even if April May couldn't have done it, he could have! Time to take action!) Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg. Grossberg: Now, I must ask you to leave. I need to think about things. Alone. Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (if \"Push her hard\" was selected upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph... Grossberg: Where did you get that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I'm sorry to have taken it without your knowledge. But... I have to know. Who is this man? He was most likely in April May's room the night of the murder. Grossberg: ! What's that you say!? A-are you QUITE sure? My boy? Phoenix: (What has him so flustered I wonder...?) Grossberg: I... I beg your pardon, but I must ask you to leave. I need to be alone. Phoenix: (...! He's fallen silent as a stone. A rather large stone. I guess I should return that photo.) Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg. Anything else Grossberg: I beg your pardon, but I am not at liberty to speak on the matter. After selecting \"Push her hard\" upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, or selecting \"Ease her fears\" upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, then presenting Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) in Grossberg Law Offices: September 7Bluecorp Inc.CEO's Office Phoenix: ... (What's with the surreal d√©cor...?) ???: Welcome! Please furnish me with the title of your personage! Phoenix: (What the...?) White: Your name! What's your name? I was just inquirably asking the title that you go by. Phoenix: Uh... Wright. Phoenix Wright. (\"Inquirably\"...?) White: Mr. Wright, is it? Right, I see... Splendiferous. Perhaps I have intimidated you with my giantesque vocabulary...? Phoenix: (What is this guy's problem!) White: I'm Redd White, CEO of Bluecorp. You know, Corporate Expansion Official? My business dealings bring me into contact with the elite of the elite. So I'm afraid I am not used to conversing with the wordily-challenged. Phoenix: (What a fruitcake!) White: Hmmm, let me guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this! Phoenix: (What does he mean by that?) White: No matter. So, what business does a \"mighty\" lawyer have with a man such as myself? Phoenix: (Yipes! This guy's arrogance meter is off the scale!) Examine Desk Phoenix: I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing. White: It is modeled on my body, see? Well? Does its sleek roundature not... inspire you? Painting Phoenix: ...? Haven't I seen this somewhere...? Is this a replica? White: Ridiculosity! I have no interest in anything but originals. That right there is a bona fide original! Worth five million, for sure. Phoenix: Hmmm... Statue Phoenix: A statue of a man holding up the world. The \"Bluecorp\" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White. White: Truly a work of art! But, probably to beautacious for you to appreciate, correct? Phoenix: (I think it's a little too \"beautacious\" for just about anyone to appreciate.) Trophy display Phoenix: An impressive line-up of trophies. \"Judges Special Runner-up\" \"Best Participation\" \"Judges Cooperation Award\" \"Special Good Try Prize\" Hmm. The words \"Judges\" and \"Special\" kind of stand out. Window Phoenix: This is the top floor of a 20-story building. The view is quite... presidential. Talk Miss May Phoenix: Miss May is an employee of Bluecorp, is she not? White: Correct. She was my secretariat. What a shock it was to hear what she has done! Phoenix: \"What she has done\"... You mean the wiretap? White: Indeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods! It is ineffable that she would do this. Phoenix: (It sounds like he's trying to turn Miss May into a scapegoat...) Night of the murder Phoenix: On the night of the murder were you in April May's hotel room? White: Who can say? I seldom pay attention to mundane details such as time and place. My motto is: \"Don't worry, be happy!\" Phoenix: Still, Mr. White... The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly. White: ... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that. Phoenix: (Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have \"seen\" the same thing as April May!) White: Oh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement! Bluecorp Phoenix: What kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway? White: Ah, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information. We are a company of the future! You might say, we ARE the future! Phoenix: (Sell... information?) White: In just 10 years, I've built this business up into the grand office you see now. Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color \"blue\"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course! Fantabulistic, is it not? That painting (appears after \"Miss May\" and \"Night of the murder\") Phoenix: Uh... there's something that's been bothering me. White: Yes? What might that be? Phoenix: That big painting on the wall over there... It's gorgeous Phoenix: It's a very striking piece of art. White: Magnificentatious, isn't it! Phoenix: Yeah. ... (Why am I making small talk...?) Leads back to Talk options I've seen it before Phoenix: You know, I've actually seen that painting before. White: Oh? Phoenix: Just yesterday, actually. White: Your point being...? Phoenix: My point is simple. Er, rather, my question is simple: Why is that painting hanging on your wall? Leads to: \"...\" When did you get it? Phoenix: Say, when did you get that painting? White: ... Hmm... no idea! I forgot! Phoenix: I've seen that painting before. Yesterday, in fact. Why do I find that painting here today? Leads to: \"...\" Present Wiretap Phoenix: About this wiretap... White: Ah, the one that Miss May used, right? Bad girl. Bad, bad girl. Phoenix: She testified that she placed the wiretap at your request. White: How pathetic. I guess she's trying to pass the buck. Bad, bad girl. Sorry I can't help you. I know nothing. Phoenix: (I'm going to need hard evidence to get anything out of this guy...) Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) Phoenix: About this picture... White: Gorgeous! That's a picture of me! Ah, I see it was taken in the prime of my youth. About 10 years ago, at a guess. Phoenix: The hotel bellboy says he saw this man on the night of the murder. White: ... On closer inspection, he does look a lot like me, but I'm afraid this is someone else. Nope. That's definitely not me. He's far too young. Anything else White: I am terribly sorry. But that really doesn't seem to concern me at all. White: ... Mr. Wrong, was it? Phoenix: Wright. White: It appears you do not fully grasp your position here. I ask again. Who are you? Phoenix: Umm... huh? A lawyer? White: No, my feeble friend. A \"mere\" lawyer. Worth nothing. Zilch. Zippo. Nada! Just like that sorry excuse for an attorney, Grodyburger! Phoenix: (Wh-what!?) Ungh! Oof...! Unh... uhhh... (He... he punched me!) White: Well, Mr. Lawyer. What will you do, eh? Charge me with assault? Charge away, I welcome it! For it is YOU who will be found guilty! Phoenix: What...? White: Heed my exposition! The police, the courts, they all do my bidding. Phoenix: (So you say... But I wonder... Is that kind of control really possible?) White: I don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume? Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg's... yes. White: Then you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you? Perhaps he will explain how a man can live life purely for personal profit! ... Go now! Skedaddle! There is nothing more to discuss! Examine Desk Phoenix: I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing. Painting Phoenix: This painting was, until yesterday, hanging in Mr. Grossberg's office. Why does White have it now? It's not hard to imagine a few possibilities. Statue Phoenix: A statue of a man holding up the world. The \"Bluecorp\" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White. Trophy display Phoenix: An impressive line-up of trophies. \"Judges Special Runner-up\" \"Best Participation\" \"Judges Cooperation Award\" \"Special Good Try Prize\" Hmm. The words \"Judges\" and \"Special\" kind of stand out. He probably strong-armed them into giving him something. Talk Any option White: Would you be kind enough to cease your inane chattering and vacate the premises? Let me put it in language you are sure to understand: Shut up and get out! I have nothing more to say. Present Anything White: Would you be kind enough to cease your inane chattering and vacate the premises? Let me put it in language you are sure to understand: Shut up and get out! I have nothing more to say. Detention Center (after visiting Bluecorp) Phoenix: Apparently, Miss May is in questioning. I doubt they'll let me talk to her today. Examine Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Grossberg Law Offices (after selecting \"\"I've seen it before\" or \"When did you get it?\" upon selecting \"That painting\" Talk option in Bluecorp) Grossberg: ... ... ... Phoenix: (Huh? I don't think he's noticed me standing here. Maybe I should... clear my throat?) Aaa-HHHEM! Grossberg: Jumping Jehosephats! Oh! You! Phoenix: What's wrong? You looked so pensive... like an old man at the end of his days. Grossberg: Hmm? I'm not senile yet! I was just thinking about this whole mess... Phoenix: (Something's really bothering him, that much is clear.) Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So you came to see the trial? Grossberg: Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see, couldn't get a wink of sleep. Phoenix: Really? What was that? Grossberg: Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl. Your refusal Phoenix: I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know. Grossberg: A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy. Phoenix: ... (He does seem troubled about something... I'm starting to have a feeling I know what it is.) Mr. White Phoenix: So, I paid Bluecorp a visit. Grossberg: Oh? Oh, I see. Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg... I have to admit, something has been bothering me. Grossberg: Oh? What is it? Well, out with it, my boy! Phoenix: You see, it's just... That big painting Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had \"no intention of parting with\"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office. Grossberg: ... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting... Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, I know you and Mr. White are connected somehow! Grossberg: C-connected, you say? Phoenix: Yes! And I know what it is... He's giving you information Phoenix: You're his client, aren't you? He's giving you information! Grossberg: What's that now? Phoenix: You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services! Grossberg: ... Phoenix: You gave him that painting in exchange for some valuable information, didn't you? Grossberg: Utterly ridiculous. Me, his client? I would never willingly deal with that man. Never! Phoenix: (Huh? Did I get it wrong?) Leads back to Talk options He's blackmailing you Phoenix: Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail? Grossberg: ...! Phoenix: I think that painting is fairly gaudy proof. Grossberg: ... Very well. This may be the chance I've been waiting for. Maybe it's time to get this off my chest, so I can finally rest easy again. After all, you were Mia's understudy. Perhaps it was fate? Phoenix: (What's he talking about...?) Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" You're lovers Phoenix: It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you! Grossberg: W-w-what! My boy! Phoenix: You sent that painting to him! As a sign! A sign of undying love! Grossberg: M-m-my boy, please! You're letting your fancies run away with you! Where do you get these bizarre ideas? Phoenix: I... I don't understand how you could... Grossberg: That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous! ... Enough. I'll swallow my pride and tell you all. Phoenix: (I knew it! They are lovers!) Grossberg: N-no! We are NOT lovers! Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" That photo of Mr. White Phoenix: That photo of Mr. White... Why would you have his photo, Mr. Grossberg? Grossberg: Umm... yes, well. It's been a long time since then... Phoenix: A long time ago? I'm sorry... but I think not. I think you still have ties to Mr. White even today. Grossberg: R-really! Whatever gave you that idea! W-what connection could I possibly have to an individual such as he? Phoenix: It's pretty straightforward, actually... You go drinking together Phoenix: You go drinking together! You're friends, aren't you? Grossberg: ... Now you're being foolish, my boy. Why in the world would I ever drink with the likes of him!? Phoenix: (Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.) Leads back to Talk options He's blackmailing you Phoenix: Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail? Grossberg: ...! I don't... I don't know what you're talking about! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had \"no intention of parting with\"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office. Grossberg: ... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting... Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg... tell me what happened. Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" He's giving you information Phoenix: Redd White is supplying you with information, obviously! Grossberg: What's that now? Phoenix: You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services! Grossberg: ... Now you're being foolish, my boy. What possible use could I have for the services of the likes of him!? Phoenix: (Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.) Leads back to Talk options Why wouldn't you defend Maya? Phoenix: I thought it was strange. Here was Maya, your own apprentice's little sister, in desperate need... Accused of killing her own sister no less, and you wouldn't take the case! I finally realized why. You and Redd White are connected. He's... Your boss Phoenix: I'll bet you and White go way back! He's your boss now, and was before, I bet! Grossberg: My what? Boss? Are you serious? Phoenix: Yeah! You both have that sort of \"we're in the same club together\" feel to you. Grossberg: Please, stop. You have a very peculiar sense of humor, Mr. Wright. Very well, I'll talk. Phoenix: (What does he mean... \"sense of humor\"? I was serious!) Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" Blackmailing you Phoenix: Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail? Grossberg: ...! I don't... I don't know what you're talking about! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had \"no intention of parting with\"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office. Grossberg: ... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting... Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg... tell me what happened. Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" Your lover Phoenix: It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you! Grossberg: W-w-what! My boy! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg. The other day, there was a giant painting hanging on that wall. I saw that painting again, today. It was in the CEO's office of Bluecorp. It was a present, wasn't it? Grossberg: Well, my boy, you have a splendid imagination! Phoenix: I... I don't understand how you could... Grossberg: That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous! Phoenix: (Hmm... I guess I was wrong. But it just seemed so right!) Leads back to Talk options Present Anything Grossberg: Sorry, my boy. I don't think I can help you with that. Grossberg: Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now... Phoenix: (15 years...!) Grossberg: All because of the \"DL-6 Incident,\" as you may have guessed. Phoenix: (The name on the back of those photographs!) Grossberg: As you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did. Phoenix: (So that's the connection!) Grossberg: It is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible. Phoenix: Impossible? Why!? Grossberg: He has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians. Phoenix: What!? Grossberg: They are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years. Talk The DL-6 Incident Phoenix: What is the \"DL-6 Incident\"? Grossberg: \"DL-6\" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium. Phoenix: (A medium...?) Grossberg: Her name was Misty Fey. Phoenix: (Fey!) Grossberg: Indeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud. Phoenix: (This is what Maya was talking about the other day!) Grossberg: I did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident. Reason for blackmail Phoenix: But why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg? Grossberg: The DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him. Phoenix: You told White? Grossberg: He offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail. Phoenix: ... I see. Grossberg: ... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office. Phoenix: Mia's office...? Grossberg: She followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found. Fey & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Reason for blackmail\" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices) Phoenix: It's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look. Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: All the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here. They're in alphabetical order. Let's take a look... Which file should I look at...? File \"A-I\" Phoenix: Let's see if there's \"A\" record in this file that catches my \"I.\" \"A\"... \"B\"... \"F\"! \"Misty Fey.\" That's Mia and Maya's mother. Hmmm... Should I take a look? Read it Mia: \"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press. This parasite, who makes his fortune on threats and coercion... His name is...\" Phoenix: Hmm. The record stops there. ... So Mia knew Grossberg... Leads back to examination Leave it be Phoenix: I don't think it has much to do with the current case. I'd be interested to know what it contains... but I'll leave it alone for now. Leads back to examination File \"J-S\" Phoenix: Let's see... \"J\" through \"S\"... Nothing much in here. Maybe I'll just skim some of this? Skim Phoenix: *sigh* Well, no harm in flipping through a bit, I guess... The biggest part's here at the end in \"S\"... \"Suicide\"? Eww... She has a collection of suicide reports. There's politicians... policemen... ... ...! There's writing on most of these in pencil. \"White\"...? This is Mia's handwriting. Wait, I get it! Mia thought he was involved in these \"suicides\"! White drove them all to... ... I can use these newspaper clippings. Hmm... let's find the most disturbing one... Newspaper Clipping added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination Leave it be Phoenix: Nah... this is taking too long. Later. *yawn* I've never been good at reading these things. Leads back to examination File \"T-Z\" Phoenix: \"T\"... \"U\"... I know, \"W\"! \"White\"! ...¬†! The entire \"W\" section is missing! Was it taken...? Leads back to examination Bookshelf (after Newspaper Clipping is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Shall I check Mia's files once more? Check 'em Phoenix: Which file to check? File \"J-S\" Phoenix: Hmm... not much in the \"J-S\" section. I'm not sure reading suicide accounts will be very good for my mood... I think that's enough reading for today. Leads back to examination Leave 'em Phoenix: I don't see much point in checking files that are missing all the key parts. *yawn* I give up. Leads back to examination Grossberg Law Offices Present Newspaper Clipping Phoenix: I found this in Mia's files... Grossberg: So she was investigating Redd White, as I expected. Well, if you wanted to challenge him, you could present this in court. Phoenix: (Not a bad idea...) Bluecorp (after Newspaper Clipping is added to the Court Record) White: Well, aren't you persistent. Phoenix: Sorry, but there's something I have to ask you. White: Mr. Lawyer, I really hate having to repeat myself... But it seems the message has not yet penetrated your thick skull... Stop bothering me! If you try my patience further, I fear a nasty accident may occur. Do I make myself clear? Phoenix: (Transparent...) Talk Miss May Phoenix: (I think we're past needing to talk about April May. I've got to put this guy on the spot, and quick!) White: Hmm? What's the matter? You seem... distressed! Night of the murder Phoenix: (This guy is a pro at pulling the wool over people's eyes. I've got to put him on the spot, and quick!) White: Stop that! Your hot gaze is giving me goosebumps! Blackmail Phoenix: (There's no point asking someone this crooked a straight question! I need some evidence I can use as ammo...) White: What's wrong? Is something stuck to my face? Why yes! There's my eyes, and my nose, and my mouth... But of course I jest. You need not restrain your mirth, my friend! It is okay to indulge in my cosmopolitan sense of humor. I will not think less of you. Present Newspaper Clipping Phoenix: (This is the only clue that Mia left me... I'd better make this one count!) Mr. White... see this? It's an article describing the suicide of a politician. White: ... Phoenix: He was embezzling secret government funds. Then, one day, word got leaked to the press. The very next day he took his own life. White: And this concerns me how...? Phoenix: I found this article in Mia's office. White: Miss Mia...? Phoenix: She had a file filled with articles like this. Every one of them was labeled with a single word... \"White.\" White: ...! Phoenix: Mr. White, I know what you did to this politician. You bribed him Phoenix: You bribed him! White: B-bribed!? ... What exactly has led you to say this? Phoenix: (Um... gee, that's a good question. I guess I got ahead of myself there...) White: Hmph. You certainly have an active imagination. Phoenix: (Dammit!) Leads back to Court Record You spied on him Phoenix: You were spying on him, weren't you? White: \"Spying\"...? Phoenix: You snooped on him, and found out about the embezzlement. Then, when you revealed it, he was driven to suicide! White: Mr. Lawyer. I know nothing of this. And, even in the highly unlikely event that I did do such a thing... All I would have done is provide \"information.\" That is not a crime in this country. Phoenix: (Gah! This guy's as cool as a cucumber...!) Leads back to Court Record You blackmailed him Leads to: \"You were blackmailing him!\" Anything else White: I have no intention of parleying with you about this matter. Phoenix: You were blackmailing him! White: Blackmail? Phoenix: Not just him, either. You were threatening and coercing hundreds of others! You were involved in all of the suicide cases that Mia investigated! This company is built on blackmail! I'm right, aren't I? White: What a bizarre accusation. Mr. Wrong... What is it that you should be doing now? Investigating me? No no no. I think not! You should be searching for the one who killed Miss Mia! Interphone: *beep* [Secretary's Office, hello?] White: Mr. Wrong will be leaving now. Interphone: [Yes, sir. I'll send someone right away.] Phoenix: Wait a second, Mr. White... You're right Phoenix: You are absolutely right. I should be looking for the killer now. And actually, I've done better. I've found him. He's sitting right in front of me. Leads to: \"Just what are you insinuating?\" You're wrong Phoenix: You're wrong, Mr. White. White: Excuse me? Phoenix: What I should be doing now is going after you! Leads to: \"Just what are you insinuating?\" White: Just what are you insinuating? Phoenix: Mia was on to you. She was keeping tabs. For this reason you had April May tapping her phone. Then, Mia was murdered, and all the documents about you mysteriously disappeared. So, the culprit would be...? White: ... Phoenix: Even a child could work it out, Mr. White. You did it! White: ... Interphone: *beep* [Secretary's office.] White: We won't be needing an escort for Mr. Wrong. Instead, please connect me to the public prosecutor's office. Interphone [Of course, sir. One moment please...] ... [White? That you? What are you doing calling me at a time like this!?] White: Hello. Chief Prosecutor? I've changed my mind. I want to testify tomorrow. Interphone: [What's this about?] White: The Mia Fey case. I witnessed the murder, you see. And, thus, as a very important witness, I would like to testify. Interphone: [What? Why now? I thought you said you didn't want to go to court?] White: Quietude...! I told you I changed my mind, didn't I? Oh, and one other thing. Send the police over here right away. The man is standing right in front of me. He looks dazed but could be violent! Interphone: [What? What man?] White: Are you even listening? The executioner! The hatchet-man! The liquidator... The killer, man! Phoenix: What!? Interphone: [Mr. White... this isn't another one of those...] White: Chief Prosecutor. I do not believe you are in a position to freely offer your opinions to me, correct? I'm telling you to send the police, now! Interphone: *beep* White: ... Did I not tell you, Mr. Wrong? You are a mere lawyer! As was Miss Mia. Phoenix: How dare you! White: I'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled. No lawyer of any worth will defend you. I have friends in the local lawyer's association, you see. You'll be given a lawyer so stupendously inept that they make even you look competent. Phoenix: (I... I feel faint.) Gumshoe: Detective Gumshoe, reporting, sir! Aaa! Butz! Hairy Butz! Phoenix: Wright, actually. Phoenix Wright. And my friend's name is \"Larry\"... Gumshoe: Oh, right! Sorry, pal. Butz was that murderer, right? White: Detective Gumshoe. I present to you, the man who killed Miss Mia Fey! Gumshoe: W-what!? White: Take this despicable human being into custody. ... Farewell, Mr. Wrong! September 8, 3:37 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: I can't believe it's only been a day since the first trial. My trial begins tomorrow. White's going to set a trap for me. And the prosecution will be in on it, of course. Edgeworth, included. An attorney was assigned to me by the state, yesterday. I refused. I had an idea. Maya: ... Wright! Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Oh, Maya! Great, they let you out of detention. Maya: Just now, yes. It's all thanks to you! Phoenix: Hah. Now I'm afraid we've switched places. Maya: What? You mean, you...? Phoenix: I explained what had happened to Maya. ... Maya: I don't believe it! How many people does that man need to destroy before he's satisfied!? My mother... My sister... And now you! This has gone too far! Mr. Wright, please tell me, is there anything I can do? Phoenix: Um... well... Defend me in court Phoenix: Alright, you can be my defense lawyer tomorrow! Maya: Alright! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Leave it to me! I am Mia's sister, after all! Lawyership runs in our blood! Phoenix: (Wasn't it ghost powers that ran in your blood...?) (Changed from [Wasn't it E.S.P. that ran in your blood...?] in the original release) Maya: I'd better run to the bookstore and pick up a copy of \"Law for Rookies.\" Leads to: \"...\" Cheer me on in court Phoenix: Well, you could cheer for me in court. Maya: Cheer for you? You mean... like a cheerleader? Phoenix: Huh? Um, yeah, like that. Maya: Alright! Leave it to me! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: I'd better go get a uniform and some pom-poms...! Leads to: \"...\" Help me break out of here Phoenix: Right. Okay, listen up. I want you to help me break out of here! Maya: You mean... a jail break? Phoenix: Yeah. Tonight's our only chance! Maya: Alright! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Oh, I'd better go get a hacksaw while the stores are still open. Oh, oh! And a rope ladder, and a getaway car! Can you drive? Leads to: \"...\" Phoenix: ... W-wait. Wait wait wait. Maya: What what what? Phoenix: I'm kidding! It was a joke! Maya: No way! Phoenix: No really, I was kidding. But thanks. It's good to know you're on my side. (And there really isn't anything you can do for me anyway...) Maya: But... but I can't just sit here and do nothing! I've got to give that man a piece of my mind! Phoenix: (Just a piece...?) Okay. Then, come to the court tomorrow. Maya: O-okay! I'll be there! I'll show them a thing or two! Phoenix: Times may change, yet with crime it's the same old story. (Changed from [It's the beginning of a new century, yet with crime it's the same old story.] in the original release) In fact, it's gotten worse. Lengthy court proceedings are no longer realistic. Beginning a few years ago, a limit of three days was put on initial court trials. Almost all finish in a day. Most with a guilty verdict. I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself for this case. (Changed from [I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself.] in the original release) With the true culprit appearing as the star witness. (Changed from [Tomorrow the true culprit will appear as a witness.] in the original release) This is it! Tomorrow, it's me or him! (Changed from [This is it! It's me or him!] in the original release) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here.\n-- Witness's Account --White: Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How do you know what time it was? White: Because I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect, you know? Phoenix: No no no, you're not getting away with that! White: You are so mistrusting, Mr. Lawyer! So... what was the proper term for \"secretary\" again...? Anyway, Miss May ordered room service for 9:00. It happened soon after the room service arrived. Phoenix: (Hmm. That's what Miss May said, too.) Press further Phoenix: True, the bellboy who brought the coffee saw Miss May. But he testified that he did not see you at the time! White: Ahem. This is your concern? Silly Lawyer! Miss May received the coffee outside the room! Of course he could not see me. He would need X-ray vision to pull off something like that! Phoenix: (Hmm...) Edgeworth: Tell us, what were you doing at the time? Leads back to cross-examination Hold back Phoenix: (I don't see anything to gain by attacking him on this point any further.) Okay, what were you doing at the time? Leads back to cross-examinationWhite: I was quietly perusifying... er, that's \"reading\" to you, some papers by the window.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: By window, you mean the one directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Office? White: Correct! That is the only window, you see. Phoenix: And there you were reading... papers? White: Correct! The Gatewater is a businessman's hotel, and I am a busy man who had business to do!White: Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A \"bedlam\"? White: It must have been when you attacked, I assume. Edgeworth: We see. Continue.White: Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you were reading your papers until you heard that sound? White: But of course. I am no snoop, peeping out of windows at night. Phoenix: (No snoop? Yeah, right! You've made a career out of snooping!)White: It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: S-spiky-haired!?White: Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What you just said directly conflicts with Miss May's testimony! Miss May clearly stated that the assailant looked like a \"girl\"! White: I've always been proud of my eyesight, Mr. Lawyer. Phoenix: Just what is your eyesight? White: Counting both eyes... 40! Phoenix: 40!? Don't add them together! Judge: I think the witness is trying to say his eyesight is good. Phoenix: (Hey, whose side is the judge on, anyway?) Edgeworth: And what did you do then?White: I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was surprised of course.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What was Miss May doing at that time? White: She had just finished watching a soap opera on the TV, and was weeping openly. Phoenix: Did you know she had been tapping the Fey office phone? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Irrelevant! That has nothing to do with the case at hand. White: I care not. I will answer the lawyer's bold inquiry. Miss May was acting alone when she tapped the phone of this Fey woman. Phoenix: You'd make a good politician, Mr. White. White: Ho hoh! After all, I am \"El Presidente.\" Judge: Please continue.White: The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Can you be a little more detailed about that? I think it's worth knowing exactly what happened. White: Of course! Comprende! I understand! The victim was attacked, by you, and ran to the left. You gave chase, and struck her down! Edgeworth: Are you sure? White: As you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect! Judge: Perhaps you could change your testimony to reflect this new detail. Changes statement from \"The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!\" to \"The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!\"White: The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure about that? White: How many times must I say it? I am abso-posi-lutely perfect! End of story! Phoenix: (How many times must I hear that?) Maya: Psst! Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as a little odd?Present May Testimony Phoenix: Leads to: \"Wait right there!\"White: Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Um... \"impaction\"? Don't you mean just \"impact\"? White: Ridiculosity! I think you need to brush up on your language skills! Phoenix: (On second thought, perhaps I'd better leave the whole language thing alone...)Phoenix: (Did Edgeworth \"prep\" this guy, too, I wonder? Anyway, I'd better find a weakness in there...)Phoenix: Wait right there! Mr. White, you've dug your own grave!White: What is this!?Phoenix: You said the victim ran to the \"left.\" But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony! She clearly stated that the victim ran \"right\"!White: ...! Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.Phoenix: I think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running directly away from the door! She would have been running into a dead end! Don't you find that odd?White: ! Very strange... I did see her run to the left... I did.Maya: Phoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this one.Phoenix: True. (Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)Judge: Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor?Judge: Miss May says \"right,\" and Mr. White says \"left.\" Can you explain this contradiction to the court?Mr. White is right Phoenix: As Mr. White testified, Mia ran to the left. Judge: But... But if that's the case... Why would she run in the opposite direction from the door? Phoenix: She did not. She was running towards the door, Your Honor. Edgeworth: Bwah! Now you're the one making a contradiction, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Not at all. Leads to: \"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Miss May is right Phoenix: As Miss May has stated, Mia ran to the right after she was attacked. White: What is this? I am not fashioning fabrications, I assure you! That lady ran to the left! I am sure of it! Phoenix: Then there can be only one explanation. Edgeworth: Eh...? And that is? Leads to: \"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Both are right Phoenix: Both witnesses are telling the truth. (For once...) Edgeworth: Hah! I doubt it! Er, rather, that does not clear up the contradiction! Phoenix: There is one scenario that would explain their conflicting accounts. Edgeworth: What!? Leads to: \"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Phoenix: Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!Judge: Mr. Wright! What do you mean?Edgeworth: Yes, what do you mean, he was not \"viewing the crime from the hotel\"!? If he was not in the hotel, where could he have been!?Phoenix: In the law offices of Fey & Co., of course! More specifically, he was standing here! (Time to show the court where Mr. White was standing!) (Changed from [Show the court where Mr. White was standing!] in the original release)Present killer's location Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is where he was!\"Present victim's location Phoenix: Phoenix: That's where he was! Edgeworth: M-Mr. Wright! We are not fools! How could he have been exactly where the victim was standing!? Phoenix: (Oh... oh, right!) Judge: Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!? Phoenix: Sorry, Your Honor! Sorry! Let me try that again... Leads back to: \"Time to the court where Mr. White was standing!\"Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: That's where he was! Judge: Hold it right there, Mr. Wright! If he was there during the very act of murder... That would make him an accomplice! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Impossible! There was no one other than the criminal and victim in the room! There is no evidence, no proof to the contrary! None! Phoenix: S-sorry! Er... let me try that again! Leads back to: \"Time to show the court where Mr. White was standing!\"Phoenix: This is where he was! Look! When the victim ran for the door... If he was watching from this point, to him it would appear that she ran to the \"left.\"Edgeworth: Please! This is no time for jokes in ill taste! That is where the killer was standing!Judge: Order! I will have order! Anyone disturbing the order of this courtroom will be held in contempt! Mr. Wright! What are you suggesting!?White: R-r-rapscallion!!!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: The postulations of the defense are a distortion of the truth, Your Honor!Judge: Indeed. They do seem a bit far-fetched...White: ... Ho hoh hoh! You provide us with so much entertainment, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix: (What now!? He's... laughing!?)White: The hilarity of the moment made me remember something... It appears I have been unclear, and for this, I apologize. Mr. Your Honor... Might I be allowed to testify once more?Judge: Very well, let's hear your revised testimony.Phoenix: (Good luck. You can't fix a broken testimony, buddy!)Witness Testimony-- She Ran to the \"Left\" --White: Miss May's testimony was correct... as was mine! When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left. And then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw. Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right. You chased her, and delivered the final blow. That is what Miss May saw. You see? You hit her twice! Don't you remember, Mr. Lawyer?Judge: Hmm... That does seem to make sense. Will you be cross-examining the witness's testimony?Phoenix: You bet I will! I mean, yes, Your Honor.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- She Ran to the \"Left\" --White: Miss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you mean by that! White: That is what I am about to explain! You Americans, always so impatient! It does not become you. Phoenix: (Hey buddy, you're an American, too!)White: When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you mean \"first\"? White: \"First\"? That is what comes before what happens \"next.\" You do speak English, right? Please, sit back, relax. I will try to use simple words for your benefit. First, she ran to the left, and then...White: And then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I didn't hit anyone! White: Now, now, Mr. Wright. There is no point hiding things from this court. Phoenix: I'm not hiding anything! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The prosecution requests that the defense refrain from interrupting the testimony! Judge: Mr. Wright, you have been warned. Phoenix: (Why's he mad at me!?)White: Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you mean \"next\"!? White: \"Next\" is what comes after \"first.\" Phoenix: I know that! White: Then that is all you need to know, Mr. Lawyer. As I said, she turned and made a desperate dash to the right.Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. White!\"White: You chased her, and delivered the final blow.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Stop saying it was me! White: But, it was you. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright! If you claim that it was NOT you, then show us proof! Phoenix: (Argh! Can I do nothing right? Nothing!?) White: May I continue?Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. White!\"White: That is what Miss May saw.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So each of you saw different parts...? White: Abso-posi-lutely! That's right, of course! Phoenix: (Where did he pick up that annoying phrase...?) White: Anyway, moving along!Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. White!\"White: You see? You hit her twice!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So were you watching both times? White: I suppose I was. And please excuse me for not testifying to this sooner!Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. White!\"Maya: What do you think Phoenix?Phoenix: I think we've got him right where we want him!

Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask. ???: I know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you? Mia: Sharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here. ???: I gotcha. So, what is it this time? Mia: It's... a clock. ???: A clock? Mia: Yeah, it's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys. ???: Hey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis! Mia: Now, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now. ???: Huh? It's not working? That's lame! Mia: I had to take the clockwork out. Sorry.

Episode 2Turnabout Sisters September 5, 9:08 PMFey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Uh oh, I'm late. Huh, that's strange. The chief must have gone home already. She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!) Examine Anywhere Phoenix: I smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay! Phoenix: That smell... Blood! ???: ... *sob* Sis... Phoenix: (Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...? Chief!!! Phoenix: Who are you? ???: ... Phoenix: (The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.) Phoenix: Chief... Examine Broken glass Phoenix: Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand. Chair Phoenix: The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too. Mia Fey's body Phoenix: Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. \"The Thinker\" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon. The Thinker added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room. Glass Shards added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be? Mia Fey's body (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly. \"Maya\" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices) Phoenix: ! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday. Receipt added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.) \"Maya\" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; after clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices) Phoenix: ! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday. (Wait a second! \"Maya\"...! Was Mia trying to tell us something about that girl? I think I'd better show her this receipt.

How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again. Window Phoenix: There's a large building right across from the office. The \"Gatewater Hotel.\" A nice, luxurious place. Bookshelf Phoenix: All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings. Computer Phoenix: Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing. Desk Phoenix: A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office d√©cor: \"Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple.\" Ledger book Phoenix: The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money. Corded phone Phoenix: Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart. ???: Police!? Please, come quick! Phoenix: (Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand... Corded phone (subsequent times) Phoenix: The phone receiver is missing a few screws. I'd better not use it. Fey & Co. Law Offices If Fey & Co. Law Offices is being visited for the first time, before Receipt is added to the Court Record Phoenix: ...! (That girl just now... where'd she go!? I put her right there on that sofa...! Uh oh... I hope she didn't run on me.) Yipes! (Don't scare me like that...) Umm... Excuse me but, who are you? ???: ... Phoenix: It's okay. I work here. Maya: Maya... Maya Fey. Phoenix: Maya... Fey? If Fey & Co. Law Offices is being visited for the first time, after Receipt is added to the Court Record Phoenix: ...! (That girl just now... where'd she go!? I put her right there on that sofa...! Uh oh... I hope she didn't run on me.) Yipes! (Don't scare me like that...) Umm... Excuse me but, who are you? ???: ... Phoenix: It's okay. I work here. Maya: Maya... Maya Fey. Phoenix: Maya... Fey? (\"Maya\"...? So Mia was writing this girl's name! Maybe I should show her the receipt? I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom!) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant. Door Phoenix: The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob. Painting Phoenix: A large painting. I guess you'd call this \"modern art.\" I, on the other hand, call it a mistake. Reception desk Phoenix: The reception desk. I usually sit here. Sofa Phoenix: This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model. Writing desk Phoenix: A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies. Talk What happened Phoenix: (She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened? Maya: ... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...! Phoenix: (So she was already dead.) You and the Chief Phoenix: So, you're the chief's...? Maya: Sister. I'm her younger sister. Phoenix: And you were here... visiting? This late at night? Maya: Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her. Phoenix: Evidence...? Maya: Yes... I-it was that clock... It was \"The Thinker.\" Present The Thinker Phoenix: Um, about \"The Thinker\"... Maya: ! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob* Phoenix: (Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...) Glass Shards Phoenix: This was lying next to the chief. Maya: I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand. Phoenix: Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...) Receipt (before examining corded phone in Office) Phoenix: Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt. Maya: ! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name? Phoenix: Please, just calm down. Maya: W-why would Sis write my name? Phoenix: (Uh-oh. Now I've done it... I'd better hurry up and call the police!) Receipt (after examining corded phone in Office) Phoenix: Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt. Maya: ! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name? Phoenix: Please, just calm down. Maya: W-why would Sis write my name? Phoenix: (Uh-oh. Now I've done it...) Anything else Maya: I'm sorry, I've never seen that before. After examining corded phone in Office and presenting Receipt in Fey & Co. Law Offices: *whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*... *whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*... Phoenix: ! The police! (Sounds like they're coming this way!) Freeze! Police! Gumshoe: Alright, I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, see? Phoenix: (Gumshoe...? What an odd name.) Gumshoe: We received a report from the building across the way, see. Got a person saying they saw a murder. Phoenix: (It must have been that woman I saw.) Gumshoe: Anyway, I don't want either of you moving one inch, 'kay? Phoenix: (Great. Just great. Maya... Wait, she wouldn't have... nah.) Gumshoe: Whoaaaaaaaaaaaah! Scuze me! Maya: Eek! Gumshoe: This word \"Maya\" here mean anything to you? Maya: ...! Um... that... That's my name... Gumshoe: WHAAAAT!? The victim drew this here note in her own blood, see? With her dying breath, she wrote down the killer's name! Maya: K-killer...? I'm not-- Gumshoe: Case closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am. Maya: W-what? Phoenix: Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible. September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.) Maya: Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning. Phoenix: Good morning! (She looks so tired...) Maya: Um... Are you going to be my attorney? Phoenix: Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about... It's up to you Phoenix: (I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you. Maya: Up... to me? Phoenix: Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here. Maya: ... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it! Leads to: \"Did I look at her like that?\" Of course I will Phoenix: (First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up! Maya: R-really...? Phoenix: (Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it? Maya: ... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it! Leads to: \"Did I look at her like that?\" Sorry, not a chance Phoenix: (Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding... Maya: ... ... ... Phoenix: (Eh heh. Whoops. That didn't go so well.) Maya: ...Heh... Phoenix: Huh? M-Maya...? Was that a... chuckle? Maya: What? N-no! ... It wasn't very believable, was it? Phoenix: (Not really...) Maya: I-I'm sorry! I just thought, since you'd made a joke... Please, don't mind me! You're doing just fine! Phoenix: (Who's trying to cheer up who here!?) Maya: ... I knew it. No one will believe me. Phoenix: What? Maya: Even you-- when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it! Leads to: \"Did I look at her like that?\" Phoenix: (Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought... Maya: I-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you. Phoenix: Heard...? Heard what about me? Maya: I... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day... Mia: \"Today was my junior partner's first time in court.\" Maya: Wow! Really? How'd that go? Mia: \"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while...\" Maya: Hah! So, he crashed and burned? Mia: \"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience.\" Maya: Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now! Mia: \"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty.\" Maya: That's what she said! Phoenix: ... Maya: I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you... Phoenix: No, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia... Maya: ... I know... Examine Security camera Phoenix: Smile for the camera... Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Talk Maya Phoenix: There's something I've been wanting to ask you... Maya: Yes? Phoenix: What's with that outfit? Maya: Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say. Phoenix: A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do? Maya: Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training. Phoenix: A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.) The day of the crime Phoenix: Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Maya: Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial. Phoenix: Evidence? Maya: Yes. That clock shaped like \"The Thinker.\" Phoenix: (The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case? Maya: Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice? Phoenix: H-her own voice!? Maya: Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone. Phoenix: You recorded it! Maya: Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things. The day of the crime (after clearing \"Your cell phone\" Talk option) Phoenix: Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard. Maya: No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial. Phoenix: (That's \"The Thinker\" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office? Maya: It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister... Phoenix: Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now. Your cell phone (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it! Maya: Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry. Phoenix: Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it. Maya: I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay? Phoenix: Sure, thanks. Maya's Memo added to the Court Record. Your cell phone (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it! Maya: Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry. Phoenix: Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it. Maya: I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay? Phoenix: Sure, thanks. Spirit mediums (appears after \"Maya\") Phoenix: So you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training. Maya: That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world. Phoenix: Wait a second, you said the \"Fey Family\"? So, Mia was into this stuff too? Maya: Of course! She left the mountain to \"follow her career,\" she said. Her powers were first-class, too! Phoenix: (I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...! Maya: What? Phoenix: So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that? Maya: Yes. ...In training. Phoenix: Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her! Maya: ...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level... Phoenix: (Hmm... I thought that would be too easy.) Present The Thinker Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about the murder weapon... Maya: Poor Sis... *sniff* Phoenix: (Hmm. Better not ask her about this now.) Glass Shards Phoenix: This was lying next to the chief's body... Maya: I saw that too. They said they thought these were pieces of a broken light stand. Phoenix: Yeah, that seems about right. (Though I'd never heard of a glass light stand before this...) Receipt Phoenix: Remember that receipt? Maya: Y-you mean the one with my name on it? Phoenix: Any idea why she... Maya: Absolutely none! Um... Do you trust me? I trust you Phoenix: I trust you. Maya: Why? Don't you think I did it, too? Phoenix: No, I don't. (It's just a hunch, but...) Maya: That detective thinks I did it. Phoenix: ... Leads back to Court Record I don't trust you Phoenix: ... Maya: I didn't think you'd believe me. You're just like the detective. Phoenix: I'm sorry... I don't like lying just to make people feel better. But it doesn't mean that I've decided you did it! (She seemed so lost at the crime scene.) Leads back to Court Record Maya's Memo Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about your cell phone... Maya: That detective took it when they brought me in. Phoenix: (So, Gumshoe took it... I'll have to try to get it back next time I see him...) Anything else Maya: Sorry... I've never seen that before. After clearing all Talk options: Maya: ... Um...! Phoenix: Huh? Something the matter? Maya: Um... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor? Phoenix: ...? Maya: This is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me? Phoenix: (Hmm...) Accept Phoenix: Sure, why not? I'll go ask. Maya: Thank you so much! I have no one else to turn to... Phoenix: ...? Say, what about your parents...? Maya: ... ... ... Phoenix: I... I see. Don't worry, leave it to me. Maya: Thank you! The trial's tomorrow... at 10:00. Phoenix: W-what!? Tomorrow!? Maya: Tomorrow. Phoenix: What if this guy refuses!? Leads to: \"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\" Refuse Phoenix: I'm sorry... I think this is the kind of thing you should really do yourself. Maya: ...You're right. ... Phoenix: Something wrong? Maya: Actually, I asked the police to contact him, and they tried calling a few times. Nobody could get a hold of him! Phoenix: They couldn't find him? Maya: I have no one left to ask! Phoenix: ...? Say, what about your parents...? Maya: ... ... ... Phoenix: O-okay! Don't worry, I'll go ask him for you. Maya: Y-you will? Thank you so much! Phoenix: I'm just worried what will happen if I can't find him. Leads to: \"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\" Maya: They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me. Phoenix: When will that happen? Maya: They're giving me until 4:00 this afternoon. Phoenix: (And visiting hours are almost up... I'd better hurry!) Right, I'll be back! September 6Fey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: (The office is filled with police officers. They're all busily searching for clues...) ???: Hey! You there! This is a crime scene, pal! No trespassing! Umm... Sorry, don't I know you from somewhere? Wait, you're that Butz guy, aren't you! Phoenix: No, no, Phoenix Wright. (How could anyone mistake me for Larry!?) ???: Ah, guess I got the wrong name, Mr. Wright. Sorry 'bout that. That Butz guy, he was a killer! And you're no killer! Right? Phoenix: (He WAS proven innocent...) Umm... right. And you were... Detective Gumshoe Phoenix: Um... Gumshoe, wasn't it? Dick Gumshoe? ???: Right! At your service. Hang on! That's Detective Gumshoe to you, pal! Leads to: \"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\" Detective Suedeshoes Phoenix: Um... Suedeshoes, wasn't it? ???: That's me! Don't step on my blue suede shoes... Wait! That's a song, pal! My name's Dick Gumshoe... W-wait! That's Detective Gumshoe to you, pal! Leads to: \"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\" Detective Gumtree Phoenix: Um... Gumtree, was it? Detective Gumtree? ???: G-Gumtree...? Gum doesn't grow on trees, pal! And I'm the one in charge here so don't push your luck! Phoenix: (Whatever you say, Detective...) Leads to: \"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\" Gumshoe: Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"... Police: Hey, Dick! Get over here! Gumshoe: Y-yes, sir! B-be right there! Umm... ahem! You're her lawyer, right, pal? If you got business here, you'd better do it quick! Phoenix: (Whew! He thinks I'm Maya's lawyer...!) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is that Mia probably read all of these. Houseplant Phoenix: Mia's favorite potted plant. I remember it had this bizarre name no one could ever remember. ???: \"Cordyline stricta,\" pal! Phoenix: (Who was that!?) Mia's desk Phoenix: Mia's desk. Perfectly clean, as always. The only thing it's missing is... Mia. Movie poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it. I'll have to check it out one of these days. Window Phoenix: The sky is blue, and so am I... There's that hotel, right across the way. Talk Mia Phoenix: About Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy? Gumshoe: Hmm? You want to know the results, eh? Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: Now don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all! Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Mia (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, Mia's death was instantaneous. Gumshoe: That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person. Phoenix: You knew her, Detective? Gumshoe: Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all. Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win! Phoenix: W-why do you say that? Gumshoe: The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution! Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) Gumshoe: I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all. Edgeworth (appears after \"Maya\") Phoenix: Prosecutor Edgeworth... Gumshoe: That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!? Of course I do! Phoenix: I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his \"guilty\" verdict. Gumshoe: Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case. Phoenix: (So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...) Leads to: \"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\" Of course not! Phoenix: Never heard of him. Gumshoe: Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him! Phoenix: (Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a \"guilty\" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...) Leads to: \"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\" Phoenix: (All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...) Present The Thinker Phoenix: I was wondering, do you know anything about this? Gumshoe: That statue? That's the murder weapon. Phoenix: (Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.) Glass Shards Phoenix: There was broken glass at the crime scene, right? Gumshoe: Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand. Receipt Phoenix: There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it! Phoenix: Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself? Gumshoe: Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not. Phoenix: (So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.) Maya's Memo Phoenix: I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone? Gumshoe: Oh that? I have that. Phoenix: Do you think you could give it back? Gumshoe: Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer! Phoenix: (Uh-oh, he's on to me!) Tell him straight Phoenix: (Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!) Gumshoe: Something the matter? Phoenix: Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective! Gumshoe: Nope. I know nothing, pal! Phoenix: That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets! Gumshoe: Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory! Phoenix: Impressive! You're quite the detective. Gumshoe: Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all. Leads to: \"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\" Tell him not-so-straight Phoenix: (Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?) Gumshoe: Something the matter? Phoenix: Oh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone... Gumshoe: This? Hmm... it says \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo\"... \"The Steel Samurai\"... that action hero on TV? Phoenix: Yeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct. Gumshoe: That what she said? Phoenix: Um. Yes. Gumshoe: ... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway. Here you go. Leads to: \"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\" Phoenix: (Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...) Maya's Cell Phone received from Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Received: Maya's Cell Phone.] in the original release) Check the Court Record to hear the recorded conversation. Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Thanks for this! Gumshoe: Don't mention it, pal. When it comes to dealing with lawyers, \"fight fair and square,\" is our motto! Phoenix: (I don't know how I feel, seeing everything written up like this... It makes Mia's death seem so... routine.) Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: (Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...) Anything else Gumshoe: Hmm? What's that? Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you! After clearing \"Mia\" and \"Maya\" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo: Phoenix: (I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.) Gumshoe: You all done, pal? Phoenix: Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now. Gumshoe: Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal! Phoenix: ... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness? Gumshoe: Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her! Phoenix: (Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then? Gumshoe: Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial! Phoenix: (So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information. Gumshoe: You got that right, pal! Phoenix: (Time to pay a visit to Miss May!) September 6Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: (According to the receptionist, the big boss is \"out\". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read. Desk Phoenix: A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster. Painting Phoenix: That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter. Potted plant Phoenix: An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available. Table Phoenix: A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn. Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303) Maya: Hey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer? Phoenix: Sorry. I haven't seen him yet. Maya: I see... Phoenix: (Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.) Talk Your family Phoenix: What about your family? Maya: I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is. Phoenix: (Don't know...? So she could still be alive?) Your mother (appears after \"Your family\") Maya: The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life. Phoenix: (\"Ruined\"...?) Maya: After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would \"become a lawyer\" and she left the mountain. Phoenix: ... So, you live by yourself? Maya: Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release) Phoenix: (I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...) Your mother's enemy (appears after \"Your mother\") Phoenix: So, who was this man who, um, \"ruined\" your mother? Maya: About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate... Phoenix: Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they? Maya: The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim. Phoenix: Wow... So, what happened? Maya: The case was solved... we thought. Phoenix: You \"thought\"...? Maya: The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent. Phoenix: ...! Maya: The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation. Phoenix: I see. Maya: ... White... Phoenix: Excuse me? White? Maya: That was his name. My sister told me. Phoenix: White? Hmm... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Hey, I got your cell phone back. Maya: Oh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice? Phoenix: ... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ... Maya: Thank you. September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303 April: Well! Hello there, handsome. Phoenix: Umm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.) April: You're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, \"Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!\" Tee hee! Phoenix: (Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.) April: Gee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness! Phoenix: (I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.) Examine Bed Phoenix: A simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here. Flowers Phoenix: The flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge. Open drawer Leads to: \"There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.\" Painting Phoenix: Ah. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be \"still life\"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall. Table Phoenix: A bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her. Window Phoenix: The late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though. Phoenix: (There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...) April: Hey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you? Phoenix: (Upset!? I thought she was going to explode for a second there! I wonder what could be inside the drawer?) Examine Open drawer Phoenix: (Hmm... what's inside I wonder?) April: *cough* *cough* Phoenix: (Maybe later...) Talk What you witnessed Phoenix: Do you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident. April: Ooh. \"Observe,\" \"incident\"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary. Phoenix: (Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please? April: Let me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer! Phoenix: (Oh boy.) Miss May Phoenix: Um, could you... just who exactly are you? April: Oooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me? Phoenix: N-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here! April: Tee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush. Phoenix: (Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do? April: Well... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you! Phoenix: (Oh boy.) This room Phoenix: I see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you? April: Oooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television! Phoenix: Oh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer! April: Say, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph! Phoenix: (Oh boy.) Present Anything April: Excuse me, but I'm a witness? Police witness? You understand? How could I possibly give you any information in good conscience, hmm? Me... \"the witness\"! It's just like the movie! Grossberg Law Offices (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303) Phoenix: (Hmm... seems like Mr. Grossberg is out. Well, maybe I should just wait here for him to come back.) ???: *Ah-HHHHEM!* Phoenix: (If that wasn't the most over-the-top clearing of the throat I've ever heard!) Grossberg: Ah hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me? Phoenix: Uh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!) Grossberg: Hmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now? Phoenix: Y-yes, well... yes. Grossberg: And what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed! Phoenix: (Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?) Grossberg: Hmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it! Phoenix: Um... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey. Grossberg: ...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on. Phoenix: (Hmm? Why the strange reaction?) Grossberg: A-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible. Phoenix: W-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!? Grossberg: Urk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion. Phoenix: (What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him! What do I tell Maya...?) Talk Your refusal Phoenix: How can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case! Grossberg: Hmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see! Phoenix: But the client is Mia Fey's sister! Grossberg: Hmm... ahem. Phoenix: Mia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands. Grossberg: Yes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye. Phoenix: Creep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere. Grossberg: *grumble*... Think not. Phoenix: Huh? Did you say something? Grossberg: I think not, I said. Phoenix: Wh-what do you mean? Grossberg: I'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy. Phoenix: Why!? Grossberg: I... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you. Phoenix: (What's going on here!?) Mia Phoenix: How did you know Mia Fey...? Grossberg: ... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see. Phoenix: A \"mission\"? Grossberg: You could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one. That painting Phoenix: That's... quite a painting. Grossberg: Ahah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you! Phoenix: (I wasn't interested...) Grossberg: It's not for sale! Phoenix: I'm not buying! (Geez!) Present Anything Grossberg: Very sorry, but I've got nothing to say regarding this matter. Fey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: ... (Looks like Detective Gumshoe has gone home. The police are still keeping themselves busy in the chief's office. No one has time to talk to me. Guess I'll head out.) Examine Houseplant Phoenix: Mia's favorite potted plant. I guess I'll have to water it now... Detention Center (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303, then visitng Grossberg Law Offices) Phoenix: Hmm... Maya's not here. She must be in questioning. They probably won't let her out for a while. Maybe I'd better go talk to that lawyer again. After clearing all Talk options in Grossberg Law Offices: September 6, 3:42 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Hiya. Maya: Oh! You're back! Did you find the lawyer? Phoenix: Um... well... (What do I tell her?) Well, see... (Just be honest!) I... I really don't think you should use that guy. He... didn't seem healthy. He was all skin and bones! Maya: ... What really happened? Phoenix: ... Maya: You don't mean... He refused to help? Phoenix: Urp. Maya: ... I see. I've been abandoned, then. After clearing \"Your mother's enemy\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, if all Talk options have been cleared in Grossberg Law Offices Leads to: \"Just a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess...\" Maya: Just a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess... Phoenix: ... (4:00 PM. Time's up. What should I do? Do I just leave her and go home...?) Go home Phoenix: (There's nothing left here for me to do... She'll be better off with a state-appointed lawyer.) I think I'd better get home now. Maya: Good-bye. Phoenix: It was a few days later when I found out how the story ended. The result of the trial was in the newspaper. \"Guilty.\" I'll probably never meet her again. Did I make the right choice? Will I ever know? Mia... if you can hear me, please, tell me! ... Phoenix: Not! I can't let that happen! I'm not leaving here until she takes me as her lawyer! Leads to: \"I've made up my mind!\" Defend Maya Leads to: \"I've made up my mind!\" Phoenix: I've made up my mind! I'm going to defend you whether you want me to or not! Maya: ! Why? Phoenix: Why? Well... I can't abandon you Phoenix: ... (No one is as sad as a person without any friends. I know... I've been there. A long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) Maya... Leads to: \"I won't abandon you. You can count on me.\" Someone else is the culprit Phoenix: You aren't the culprit! Someone else is! Maya: H-how do you know? Phoenix: I, um, I have a hunch... (Given the evidence, it would be easy to assume that Maya was the killer. But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) Maya... Leads to: \"I won't abandon you. You can count on me.\" I don't know why Phoenix: To be honest, I don't know. Maya: You don't know? Phoenix: (Is this girl sitting in front of me the killer? All the evidence seems to say \"yes.\" But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) There's only one thing I know for certain. Leads to: \"I won't abandon you. You can count on me.\" Phoenix: I won't abandon you. You can count on me. Maya: ... That's so kind of you... *sniff*... ... Phoenix: Well! Let's fight this one and get you out of here! Maya: R-right! Thank you! Phoenix: (Whew, she smiled at last. She looks like an entirely different person!) One last question... You are innocent, right? Maya: Yes! And I trust you... So you trust me, too, okay? Phoenix: It's a deal. (So, what next... There's something that's been bugging me... Just what was inside that strange woman's drawer? It was when I tried to look into the drawer that she got all defensive. There has to be something in there!) Gatewater Hotel Bellboy: Good afternoon, sir! Phoenix: Excuse me, you are...? Bellboy: Ah, I beg your pardon, sir! I am the bellboy of this establishment, at your service, sir. Phoenix: Oh, right. Bellboy: I've just come up to deliver room service, sir. Phoenix: Um... do you know where Miss May might be? Bellboy: Ah. I believe our guest Miss May is currently using the, er, facilities...? If you've no need of anything, I'll be taking my leave. Please, stay as long as you like. Enjoy... Phoenix: Yeah... Wait... no! Hey! ... (Why does it seem like every time I come here, I end up embarrassing myself? Wait... now's my chance to snoop around a bit!) Bellboy: Ah, I almost forgot! Phoenix: Gah! Y-you came back quick! Bellboy: Might I ask you to inform Miss May that there is a message for her? Please tell her that Mr. White, of Bluecorp phoned. Phoenix: Oh, right. Sure. (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? Where have I heard that name?) Maya: White... That was his name. My sister told me. Phoenix: (\"White\" was the name of the guy who ruined Mia and Maya's mother! Could it be a coincidence?) Examine Open drawer Leads to: \"There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer.\" Phoenix: There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer. Now's my chance to see what's inside! ...! What do we have here! A... wiretap? Hmm! What would a woman like her be doing with a thing like this? Wiretap added to the Court Record. Phoenix: There is definitely something suspicious about this \"Miss May\"! Why would she have something like this in her hotel room? There's a story behind all this, I know it! Alright... I'll be using this bit of evidence in tomorrow's trial, that's for sure. For Maya's sake... I'll get to this woman's bottom! Wait... I mean ... you know what I mean. April: Oh, bellboy...? Still there? Phoenix: (Uh oh, time to scram! I look forward to tangoing with you tomorrow, Miss May! In court!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Turnabout Sisters Transcript Transcript (JP) Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 September 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1 Judge: The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey. Edgeworth: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement. Edgeworth: Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor. Judge: I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then. Edgeworth: If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe! Edgeworth: Witness, please state your name and profession to the court. Gumshoe: Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder. Gumshoe: Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here. Edgeworth: And the cause of death? Gumshoe: Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of \"The Thinker\" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir! Judge: The court accepts the statue as evidence. Phoenix: (They're still calling it a \"statue\"...) Floor Plans added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Now, Detective... Gumshoe: Y-yes sir! Edgeworth: You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why? Gumshoe: Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir! Judge: Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this \"hard evidence.\" Witness Testimony -- Maya Fey's Arrest -- Gumshoe: As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene! There were two people there already: The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright. I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey! Why? We had a witness account describing her! The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder! Judge: Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination. Phoenix: Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...) ...whoosh...SMACK! Phoenix: (Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!\" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!) Judge: Something the matter? Phoenix: No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Maya Fey's Arrest -- Gumshoe: As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who did you say you got a call from? Gumshoe: Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene! Phoenix: (Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue. Gumshoe: There were two people there already: Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime? Gumshoe: Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes! Phoenix: Th-that's pretty fast! Gumshoe: Our motto this month is \"quick response\"! That's how I got there before the killer got away! Edgeworth: Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were. Gumshoe: Yes sir! Gumshoe: The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely sure it was us? Gumshoe: Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene! Phoenix: (Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...) Gumshoe: I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why's that? What's your reason? Gumshoe: Why? We had a witness account describing her! Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold on just one second!\" Gumshoe: The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder! Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold on just one second!\" Phoenix: (I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!) Phoenix: Hold on just one second! Gumshoe: Y-yeah? Phoenix: If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had \"hard evidence\" she did it, correct? Gumshoe: Huh? Did... did I say that? Me? Phoenix: I heard you say it! Judge: You did say it. Edgeworth: You said it. Phoenix: Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was \"hard evidence\"!? Gumshoe: Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink... Judge: That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective? Gumshoe: Umm... Phoenix: (Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!) Gumshoe: ... Yes. Phoenix: (Gah!) Gumshoe: Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor! Judge: Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again. Witness Testimony -- Hard Evidence -- Gumshoe: After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes. I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body! On it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood! Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's! Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger! Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name! How you like that? That's my \"hard evidence\"! Judge: Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective. Gumshoe: Y-Your Honor? Judge: Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!? Gumshoe: Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir. Judge: Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Hard Evidence -- Gumshoe: After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And did you find any evidence? Gumshoe: Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part! Phoenix: (I got a bad feeling about this...) Gumshoe: I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it! Gumshoe: Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants? Phoenix: Wh-who? Um... The killer Phoenix: Th-the killer! Anyone can see that! Gumshoe: Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please! Phoenix: She was framed! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence? Phoenix: Ah... (Urk!) Edgeworth: Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright. Gumshoe: Yeah, pal! Phoenix: (Argh...!) Leads to: \"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\" Miss May Phoenix: Well... it could have been the witness, Miss May! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright! Gumshoe: Yeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal! Phoenix: (Argh...!) Leads to: \"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\" I did Phoenix: It... it could have been me! Gumshoe: What! S-so it was you! Phoenix: No, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note? Phoenix: Uh... Edgeworth: Listen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur! Phoenix: (...!) Leads to: \"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\" Edgeworth: Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found. Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: On it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!? Gumshoe: Of course I do, pal! Phoenix: (Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident. This might not be good...) Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What kind of \"tests\" were these again? Gumshoe: Huh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests! Judge: Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony. Gumshoe: Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir. Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Y-yeah? Edgeworth: I think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check. Gumshoe: Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Phoenix: (That was a mess...) Gumshoe: Right! Where was I? Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: On which hand was the bloody finger, Detective? Gumshoe: The right hand! Phoenix: (Hmm... she WAS right handed...) Gumshoe: Hah hah hah! Nice try! Phoenix: (Uh oh... I guess it wasn't too hard to see what I was getting at there.) Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name? Gumshoe: Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies! Phoenix: This isn't a movie, Detective. Gumshoe: Oof! Phoenix: Let's talk about reality, shall we? Gumshoe: Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no. Phoenix: Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister? Gumshoe: Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer! Judge: Order! Order! Phoenix: (That didn't go so well...) Gumshoe: Th-that's right! What he said! Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Phoenix: (That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!) Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying? Gumshoe: Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!? Phoenix: You have it backwards, Detective. Gumshoe: B-backwards? Phoenix: The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. \"Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object.\" She died immediately! Gumshoe: But...! Phoenix: No \"but\"-ing your way out of this one, Detective! Judge: Order! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report? Phoenix: Wh-when...!? The day of the murder Phoenix: I... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder. Gumshoe: You're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after! Phoenix: Oh. Right. Leads to: \"The prosecution's point being...?\" The day after the murder Phoenix: It was the day after the murder... Leads to: \"The prosecution's point being...?\" I forget Phoenix: I'm... sorry, I forgot. Edgeworth: Hah! Forgot, you say? Gumshoe: It was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally! Phoenix: Oh. R-right. Leads to: \"The prosecution's point being...?\" Judge: The prosecution's point being...? Edgeworth: That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor. Phoenix: Wh-what!? Edgeworth: A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! \"Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow.\" I received these results this morning. Phoenix: N-no way! Edgeworth: Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write \"Maya\"! That is all. Judge: I see! Phoenix: (Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!) Edgeworth: Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say? You're a sham, Edgeworth! Phoenix: Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report? Judge: Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution! Edgeworth: No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable. Leads to: \"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\" The detective's a sham! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!? Gumshoe: Huh? I-I thought... Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Urp! Edgeworth: I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that. Gumshoe: Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir. Edgeworth: You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month. Gumshoe: W-what? B-but... *sigh* Leads to: \"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\" I'm a sham! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe. Are you calling me a fool because I believed your report? Gumshoe: Huh? Me? I-I'm not... huh? Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Urp! Edgeworth: I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that. Gumshoe: Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir. Edgeworth: You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month. Gumshoe: W-what? B-but... *sigh* Leads to: \"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\" Edgeworth: Your Honor, I submit this report to the court. Judge: U-understood. The court accepts the evidence. Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record. Edgeworth: Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer. Judge: I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes. Phoenix: (Darn! This isn't good!) Edgeworth: The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes! Judge: Let the witness Miss April May take the stand. Phoenix: (Exactly what part of her is \"innocent\"...?) Edgeworth: Witness, your name, please. April: April May! At your service! *wink* Judge: Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking! ([wanton] misspelled as [wonton] in the original release) April: Aww... Yes, Your Honor. Phoenix: (This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!) Edgeworth: Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred? April: Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch. Edgeworth: And this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices? April: Mmm... that's right, big boy. Judge: Please testify to the court about what you saw. Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- April: It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know! And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked! The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair! Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away! But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her! Then the woman with long hair... She kinda... slumped. The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink* Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: Well, Your Honor? Judge: I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any... Phoenix: W-wait, Your Honor! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: What about my cross-examination!? Judge: I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you? Edgeworth: Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies... Phoenix: H-hey! How dare you! Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness? Yes, I'm doing it Phoenix: I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!) Leads to: \"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!\" No thanks Phoenix: No... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point. Edgeworth: Heh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case! Phoenix: (Wh-what? That's it!?) Judge: Very well. Phoenix: W-wait! Hold on! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness? Phoenix: Yes yes yes! (I'd better, or I'll lose on the spot!) Leads to: \"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!\" Judge: Very well, you may begin your cross-examination! Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- April: It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why did you do that? April: Huh? \"Why\"? Like, why what? Phoenix: Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something? April: Oh, well, um... gee! Phoenix: (What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!) April: I sort of, y'know. I had a feeling! Phoenix: (Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question! Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?) Go for it Phoenix: (Let's see how far I can run with this...) Surely, you must have had a reason to look out your window at that time of night! April: I... oooh! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness! Phoenix: B-badgering? Edgeworth: You insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed. (Yeah! Yeah! Stop him!) (The poor girl!) Judge: Order! Mr. Wright, you have been warned. Phoenix: (Poor girl!? What about poor me!?) Leads to: \"You looked out the window. What did you see next?\" Back down Phoenix: (If I go too deep, I might not come back out alive... I'll back off for now.) Leads to: \"You looked out the window. What did you see next?\" Edgeworth: You looked out the window. What did you see next? April: And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The woman with long hair... that was Mia Fey? April: Um-hmm! Slender, sort of, well, some people might say pretty, if that's your thing. Phoenix: (Your... thing?) Edgeworth: And the person attacking her? April: The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How do you know she was the defendant? April: Huh? Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay? Edgeworth: There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor. Phoenix: (He's right...) Yep, he's right Phoenix: (Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.) Edgeworth: So then, tell us what happened to the victim. Leads back to cross-examination I question the testimony Leads to: \"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!\" April: Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She \"dodged\"? Dodged what!? April: Well... the attack! Edgeworth: Please, continue your testimony. April: But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How did you know it was my client!? April: Huh? Well, I... gee! First of all, she had a girl's physique! And, and secondly, she was... she was small! Who else could it be but her! Phoenix: (She has a point...) You're right Phoenix: (Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one. Maybe I should just listen to the testimony again.) Leads back to cross-examination I question your testimony Leads to: \"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!\" Phoenix: (Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!) Phoenix: Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks! April: W-what!? Phoenix: Miss May, I'm willing to bet that... You saw nothing Phoenix: Did you really see the defendant at all!? Leads to: \"Urp!\" You're lying Phoenix: Are you telling the truth? Did you really see the defendant!? Leads to: \"Urp!\" April: Urp! Judge: Mr. Wright! What's the meaning of this? April: Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean! Phoenix: Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique! April: ...! Phoenix: No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus! April: But... but! Judge: Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder... Phoenix: She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May? April: Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling. Judge: Miss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony. April: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink* Judge: Your testimony again, if you would. Phoenix: (Damn, I almost had her!) Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- April: I did see everything! I did! The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right. Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her... And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did! That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think? Well? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee! Judge: I... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- April: I did see everything! I did! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you saw me then, too? April: Of course! I'd remember that spiky hair anywhere! Phoenix: (Spiky...?) Judge: The witness will refrain from personal attacks on the defense attorney. April: Aww, was I a bad girl? I'm sowwy. Judge: Very well... continue. April: The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is that \"right\" as in your right, as you looked from the hotel? April: Um... which hand do I hold my knife in again...? Right! It was my right hand! Right? Edgeworth: Satisfied, Mr. Wright? Please continue. April: Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How convenient for you to remember her \"hippie\" clothes! April: That's what you--I mean, that's what she was wearing! Oh, and her hair was all done up like a bun! Phoenix: (*sigh*...) Judge: What happened then? April: And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where did this weapon come from? April: She picked it up from the desk! Judge: I see. What sort of weapon was it? April: That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A... clock? (Didn't this come up in another testimony recently...?) April: W-well? Don't look so sour, Mr. Lawyer. You can't win them all. Phoenix: (No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!) Present The Thinker Phoenix: Leads to: \"Miss May.\" Phoenix: (Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.) Phoenix: Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing. April: Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer... Phoenix: You just said that this statue of \"The Thinker\" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it! April: Urp! Phoenix: Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a \"clock,\" too... And he was found guilty... of murder! Judge: Order! Order! Phoenix: Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock? April: Oooh... urp! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns! Judge: Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...) Judge: ... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness. Phoenix: (Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!) April: Huh? What? So... what happens now? Phoenix: What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock? April: What...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time! Phoenix: So, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.! April: N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee! Edgeworth: The law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock! Judge: Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied? Phoenix: No, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because... She couldn't have heard it Phoenix: You were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You have proof that she could not? Phoenix: Uh... Edgeworth: Amateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing. Phoenix: Then I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard... Edgeworth: The prosecution denies your request! Phoenix: Wh-what!? On what grounds? Edgeworth: This is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand! Judge: Indeed. Objection sustained. Phoenix: (Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!) Judge: Ready to proceed, Mr. Wright? Leads back to: \"No, Your Honor!\" It couldn't have rung Leads to: \"Your Honor, members of the court...\" Phoenix: Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang! It's empty Phoenix: That clock is missing its clockwork! Judge: H-how could you possibly...? Phoenix: Just have a look... Right now! (Changed from [Just have a look... As soon as you can!] in the original release) Judge: ... Oh! Phoenix: See anything interesting, Your Honor? Judge: It is as the defense says! Leads to: \"This clock is missing its clockwork!\" It's broken Phoenix: I-I think it's broken! That clock's busted! Judge: You \"think\"? Phoenix: J-just look at it! Your Honor, please examine the clock! Judge: Hmm... Oh! Phoenix: See anything interesting, Your Honor? Judge: Well, I'm not sure I would call this \"broken,\" but I doubt it could ring...! Leads to: \"This clock is missing its clockwork!\" The batteries are dead Phoenix: The batteries on that clock must be dead! Judge: \"Must be,\" Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Your Honor, if you would inspect the clock...! Judge: Hmm... very well. ... Oh! Phoenix: Well, Your Honor? Are they...? Judge: This clock has graver problems than dead batteries! Leads to: \"This clock is missing its clockwork!\" Judge: This clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this? Phoenix: It is as you can see. The \"clock\" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar! April: F-fat!? Phoenix: Well, Miss May? Edgeworth: Tsk tsk. Phoenix: ? Edgeworth: Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!) Edgeworth: I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction! Judge: ! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it. Edgeworth: And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor! Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed? Edgeworth: Ho hoh! Impossible, of course... Phoenix: I have proof. Edgeworth: W-what!? Phoenix: Wasn't it you who told me \"proof is everything\"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the \"proof\" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Leads to: \"Take a look at this!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you say to that? April: W-what? I don't rightly understand what that's supposed to mean! Judge: I don't rightly understand either. Edgeworth: Ho hoh! Phoenix: (Uh oh... I think I blew it.) Judge: Mr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future. Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor! Leads back to: \"The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...\" Phoenix: Take a look at this! Judge: Hmm. That's a very cute cell phone. April: Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone! Phoenix: W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder! Judge: Order! Order! Edgeworth: The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention! Phoenix: Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it? Edgeworth: *grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...) Phoenix: (I gotta say, I'm starting to feel bad for the big fella.) (Changed from [My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.] in the original release) Let's hear the conversation. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [So you just want me to hold on to \"The Thinker\" for you, then?] Mia: [If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.] Maya: [Huh? It's not working? That's lame!] Mia: [I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.] ...[September 5, 9:27 AM] Cellular: *beep* Phoenix: Your Honor, I think this makes it clear the clockwork was already gone by the time this was recorded, (Changed from [I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone...] in the original release) which was well before the witness even arrived at her hotel! (Changed from [and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!] in the original release) April: Muh... muh... muh!? Phoenix: Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!? April: ... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink* Judge: So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright? Yes Leads to: \"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\" No Phoenix: Oh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!) Judge: Then, the court would like-- Phoenix: Hold on! P-please wait, Your Honor! Judge: Y-yes...? So you do have an objection? Phoenix: Um, yes, well... Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Sorry, Your Honor, it's just... Leads to: \"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\" Phoenix: The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\" But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court! Judge: Well then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before. Present The Thinker Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's simple.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here is undeniable proof! Edgeworth: Hah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece! Judge: Hmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind? Leads back to: \"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.\" Phoenix: It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever! April: W-whaaat!? Phoenix: A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody! April: I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores! Phoenix: Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...? April: Mmpf... Phoenix: Oh? Excuses not on sale today? April: Oooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die! Judge: W-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm! April: Hrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink* Phoenix: (S-scary...) Judge: Miss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock? April: ... Judge: Hmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior? Phoenix: (Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because... You held it Phoenix: (This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands! Judge: Mr. Wright! When was this!? Phoenix: When she used it to strike the victim! When else? Judge: Order! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!? Phoenix: April May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made \"The Thinker\" ring! That's when you heard it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: W-what's that supposed to mean!? Edgeworth: It was you who just proved that \"The Thinker\" was empty! Phoenix: Oh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!) Edgeworth: What's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder. Phoenix: (S-she can't prove it! She did it!) April: It would be MY pleasure! Phoenix: N-no way! April: Yes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy! Edgeworth: Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid! Judge: Mr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman! Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know \"The Thinker\" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof! Judge: Well... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock? Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Phoenix: The defendant's cell phone. Judge: Yes, we've seen that already. Phoenix: Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.] Mia: [Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.] Maya: [Again? What's it this time?] Mia: [It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!] ... Judge: They do mention \"The Thinker.\" But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation? Present Wiretap Phoenix: Leads to: \"Have a look at this.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!) Judge: Mr. Wright! Your evidence, please! Leads back to: \"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\" Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!? April: I... I... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is ridiculous! Phoenix: Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer. April: La... laaa... lrrrrgf! Judge: Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone? April: ... Judge: Miss May! April: Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER! ...... April: I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!) You did it, didn't you? Phoenix: Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you? April: Are you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Why the wiretap? Phoenix: Miss May... Why did you tap her phone? April: ... Phoenix: Answer the question! April: Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant? Phoenix: (Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that \"irrelevant\"! Judge: While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone? April: At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Present Wiretap Phoenix: Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not? April: Oooh. Oooooh! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is irrelevant! Judge: I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap. Edgeworth: This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone? Phoenix: Absolutely! Edgeworth: Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT! Phoenix: Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple! Edgeworth: WHAAAAT!? Phoenix: Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Leads to: \"I present the defendant's cell phone.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This! I think... Judge: That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think... Phoenix: W-wait! That was just a warm up! Judge: Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time! Leads back to: \"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\" Phoenix: I present the defendant's cell phone. Judge: Yes, we've seen that. Phoenix: Listen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.] Mia: [Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.] Maya: [Again? What's it this time?] Mia: [It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!] ... Phoenix: Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation!

Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!) You did it, didn't you?

I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Why the wiretap?

If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence reveals the truth of the matter! Judge: What does it reveal, exactly? Edgeworth: The mad delusions of the defense, perhaps? Phoenix: (Uh oh, bad reaction. Maybe that wasn't the thing...) Judge: I'm afraid it has revealed a certain over-eagerness... Let me ask again: Leads back to: \"How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock?\" You had heard about it Phoenix: The witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock! Judge: She \"heard\"...? Phoenix: That is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known \"The Thinker\" was a clock! And I can show you the proof! Judge: Well, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had \"heard\" the murder weapon was a clock. Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Phoenix: The defendant's cell phone. Judge: Yes, we've seen that already. Phoenix: Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.] Mia: [Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.] Maya: [Again? What's it this time?] Mia: [It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!] ... Judge: They do mention \"The Thinker.\" But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation? Present Wiretap Phoenix: Leads to: \"Have a look at this.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!) Judge: Mr. Wright! Your evidence, please! Leads back to: \"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\" Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!? April: I... I... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is ridiculous! Phoenix: Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer. April: La... laaa... lrrrrgf! Judge: Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone? April: ... Judge: Miss May!

Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!) You did it, didn't you? Phoenix: Miss May! April: What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!? Phoenix: You killed her, didn't you! Judge: Order! There will be order! April: What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops! Phoenix: So you admit you tapped her phone! April: Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl! Phoenix: Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!) April: You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will! Phoenix: You can't be serious! No way! April: Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy... Phoenix: R-room service!? April: Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee. Phoenix: I-ice coffee...!? April: Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink* Edgeworth: Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder! Phoenix: ! Judge: So, where does that leave us...? Edgeworth: It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder! Phoenix: (No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...) Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Why the wiretap? Phoenix: Why did you tap her phone? April: ... Phoenix: Answer the question! April: Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant? Phoenix: (Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.)

Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone? Phoenix: (Hah! I'd like to see her pull THAT off!) April: Mr. Lawyer, I saw that evil, evil grin! You were probably thinking \"I'd like to see her pull THAT off,\" weren't you! Phoenix: (Damn... she's good!) April: Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will! Phoenix: You can't be serious! No way! April: Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night?

That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder! Phoenix: (No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...) Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Present Wiretap Phoenix: Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not? April: Oooh. Oooooh! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is irrelevant! Judge: I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap. Edgeworth: This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone? Phoenix: Absolutely! Edgeworth: Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT! Phoenix: Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple! Edgeworth: WHAAAAT!? Phoenix: Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Leads to: \"I present the defendant's cell phone.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This! I think... Judge: That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think... Phoenix: W-wait! That was just a warm up! Judge: Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time! Leads back to: \"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\" Phoenix: I present the defendant's cell phone. Judge: Yes, we've seen that. Phoenix: Listen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.] Mia: [Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.] Maya: [Again? What's it this time?] Mia: [It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!] ... Phoenix: Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!? April: I... I... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is ridiculous! Phoenix: Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer. April: La... laaa... lrrrrgf! Judge: Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone? April: ... Judge: Miss May! April: Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER! ...... April: I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!) You did it, didn't you? Phoenix: Miss May! April: What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!? Phoenix: You killed her, didn't you! Judge: Order! There will be order! April: What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops! Phoenix: So you admit you tapped her phone! April: Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl! Phoenix: Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!) April: You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will! Phoenix: You can't be serious! No way! April: Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy... Phoenix: R-room service!? April: Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee. Phoenix: I-ice coffee...!? April: Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink* Edgeworth: Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder! Phoenix: ! Judge: So, where does that leave us...? Edgeworth: It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder! Phoenix: (No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...) Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Why the wiretap? Phoenix: Why did you tap her phone? April: ... Phoenix: Answer the question! April: Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant? Phoenix: (Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that \"irrelevant\"! Judge: While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone? Phoenix: (Hah! I'd like to see her pull THAT off!) April: Mr. Lawyer, I saw that evil, evil grin! You were probably thinking \"I'd like to see her pull THAT off,\" weren't you! Phoenix: (Damn... she's good!) April: Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will! Phoenix: You can't be serious! No way! April: Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy... Phoenix: R-room service!? April: Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD.

There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...) Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is my evidence! Judge: I'm afraid I'm not sure where you are going with all of this, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Um... \"where\"? Well, it's not so much a place as a... er... Edgeworth: Come to the end of your bluff, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: W-wait! Wait! That was, uh, practice! Here's the real evidence! Judge: Mr. Wright, this court does not condone the presentation of evidence for \"practice.\" Let's see your evidence, for real this time, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"Show me evidence proving that the witness had \"heard\" the murder weapon was a clock.\" Judge: Well, does the defense have anything to say? Phoenix: Um, well... (Come on, think of something!) Call the bellboy as a witness Phoenix: The defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it! April: I think you've sunken quite low enough already. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I object to calling the bellboy! Phoenix: W-why? What's your reason? Edgeworth: Because I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing! Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: However... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness. Phoenix: Condition...? Edgeworth: If Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of \"guilty\" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition. Phoenix: (What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared \"guilty\" on the spot! What should I do...?) Accept the condition Phoenix: (Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition. Edgeworth: Hmph. Fool... You fell right into my trap! Phoenix: (Uh oh!) Uh... um, wait... Leads to: \"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\" Give up Phoenix: (Grr! I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness. Judge: I see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Right. On with the cross-examination. Edgeworth: What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection! Phoenix: (Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!) Judge: Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call? Edgeworth: None, Your Honor. She's the last. Phoenix: (What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The defense would like to call the bellboy after all! Edgeworth: ... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought! Phoenix: ...? Edgeworth: May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced \"guilty\"! Are you prepared to accept my condition? Phoenix: (Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept! Leads to: \"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\" Continue examining Miss May Phoenix: Right. On with the cross-examination. Edgeworth: What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection! Phoenix: (Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!) Judge: Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call? Edgeworth: None, Your Honor. She's the last. Phoenix: (What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The defense would like to call the bellboy after all! Edgeworth: ... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought! Phoenix: ...? Edgeworth: May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced \"guilty\"! Are you prepared to accept my condition? Phoenix: (Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept! Leads to: \"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\" Judge: Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand! Edgeworth: I believe we're ready for the witness to testify. He certainly does look like a bellboy. Bellboy: Yes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service. Judge: That tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado, the witness may begin his testimony. Bellboy: Very good, sir! Witness Testimony -- Miss May's Room Service -- Bellboy: I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations! I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May. She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir. I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course. And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself. Judge: I see. The defense may begin its cross-examination. Phoenix: R-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!) Cross Examination -- Miss May's Room Service -- Bellboy: I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What exactly is it you do at the hotel? Bellboy: Why, anything required of me, sir. I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally. Phoenix: Are you always so... so prim? Judge: Mr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions... Bellboy: I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure it was Miss May on the phone? Bellboy: Absolutely, sir. Phoenix: H-how can you be so certain!? Bellboy: I checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir. Judge: Yes, what then? Bellboy: She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: 9:00 \"on the dot,\" you say? Bellboy: Yes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir. Phoenix: (9:00... the time of the murder!) Bellboy: I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Precisely\" 9:00, then? Bellboy: Precisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM. Phoenix: How can you be so sure!? Bellboy: Miss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. \"Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!\" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir. Phoenix: (Why would she be so particular about the time?) Bellboy: And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You are sure it was Miss April May herself? Bellboy: Ab-SO-lutely, sir. Phoenix: \"Ab-SO-lutely\"...? Bellboy: Yes, sir. As in, \"so very absolutely,\" sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine. Phoenix: How come you're so very certain!? Bellboy: Well, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an \"embrasser,\" sir. Phoenix: \"Embrasser\"!? Is that French for \"embrace\"? Bellboy: It's French for \"kiss,\" sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek. Phoenix: Wh-why would she have done that...? Bellboy: I believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir. Phoenix: (Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!) Phoenix: (This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!) After pressing fourth and fifth statements: Phoenix: ... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?) Edgeworth: Tsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here! Judge: Hmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand. Phoenix: (I can't let this happen... can I?) Protest Leads to: \"W-wait! Please wait!\" Give up Phoenix: (No...! If I give up now, I lose everything... If I just give up the case, I'd be giving up the very reason I became a lawyer!) Leads to: \"W-wait! Please wait!\" Phoenix: W-wait! Please wait! Judge: Yes? Does the defense have something to add? Phoenix: One last question... let me ask one last question! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough! Judge: Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all. Phoenix: (Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?) Check-in Phoenix: T-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May. Bellboy: Oh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really. Phoenix: I see...¬†? Excuse me... what exactly was a \"disappointment\"? Bellboy: Well, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there. Phoenix: (...! What did he say!?) What did you say!? Bellboy: Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite! Phoenix: Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person? Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I object! That was... objectionable!\" Room service Phoenix: T-tell me again about er... room service! Bellboy: A-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall. Phoenix: I see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive? Bellboy: Y-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir. Phoenix: (...! What did he say!?) What did you say!? Bellboy: Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite! Phoenix: Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room? Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I object! That was... objectionable!\" Bed making Phoenix: Bed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day. Edgeworth: I was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low! Judge: Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question. Bellboy: Yes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see. Phoenix: I see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say? Bellboy: Eh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir? Phoenix: Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room? Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I object! That was... objectionable!\" Edgeworth: I object! That was... objectionable! Judge: ... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question. Bellboy: Er... yes, I see. Phoenix: Why did you not mention this in your testimony!? Bellboy: W-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask! Phoenix: (Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention! Bellboy: Ah, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who... Phoenix: ! Bellboy: He asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir. Edgeworth: Oof! Y-you fool! Phoenix: I've done it... I've won! Phoenix: Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct? Bellboy: Yes, sir. Phoenix: Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...? Bellboy: That's right, sir. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: And who, Mr. Wright! Who is this \"other person\"! (Changed from [Who! Who is this 'other person'!] in the original release) Phoenix: Simple, it was... Miss April May Phoenix: None other than Miss April May! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Eh!? Have you heard nothing that has transpired so far!? She has an alibi! She was in the hotel at the time of the murder! Phoenix: Oh... right. Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance! Leads back to: \"Simple, it was...\" The man with Miss May Leads to: \"The man who checked in with Miss May!\" The Bellboy Phoenix: It was the bellboy and none other! Judge: Well, this comes as some surprise... Edgeworth: Your Honor, Mr. Wright... It was the bellboy who confirmed Miss May's alibi... And this in turn confirms the bellboy's alibi! He was in the hotel! Phoenix: Well, s-sure... if you put it that way... Edgeworth: I do put it that way, and I trust you will too! Phoenix: But what if they were in cahoots! Judge: You have evidence of this? Phoenix: Um... no, Your Honor. Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance! Leads back to: \"Simple, it was...\" Phoenix: The man who checked in with Miss May! Edgeworth: Oof! Phoenix: Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!! Edgeworth: M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late... Phoenix: \"Too late\"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court! Edgeworth: Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous! Judge: Enough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood? Edgeworth: Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor. Judge: That is all today for the trial of Maya Fey. Court is adjourned! September 7, 2:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Maya: Mr. Wright! You were amazing in there! Phoenix: R-really? Maya: I think I might be your newest fan! Phoenix: Oh, I was just \"doing my job\" you know... heh heh. Maya: Then again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too... Phoenix: Huh? Maya: That face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine! Phoenix: Hmm... if you say so. Maya: So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now? Phoenix: Um, well... (Changed from [Well, no.] in the original release) No, I don't think so. Not yet. (Changed from [I don't think so. Not yet.] in the original release) Maya: Oh... I see. Phoenix: But I got a great lead in today's trial! Maya: A \"lead\"? Phoenix: That man with Miss May! He's the key! Maya: Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway? Phoenix: I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed. Maya: Yes sir! Phoenix: I'm going to find out more about this man. Maya: Do you think he was the one who...? Phoenix: Maybe so. Maya: Sis... Phoenix: Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise. Maya: I'm counting on you! Phoenix: I asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that hasn't been stricken from the record. (Changed from [In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.] in the original release) May Testimony added to the Court Record. Phoenix: I don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to set her free! (Changed from [Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to get her free!] in the original release) To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory. Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow? Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Maya Fey... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!

I didn't expect anyone to visit me in such a dank place as this... It's really quite... moving. Not! You stinking lawyer! I hope you die! Have you come to laugh? Yes, laugh at the fallen Miss May! Phoenix: No, not really, there's something I wanted to ask. April: Unfortunately, there is nothing I want to BE asked. Haven't you done enough questioning, you...! Spiky-head! Phoenix: (Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the security guard. April: ... So? What is it you wish to ask of me, then? Hmm? Phoenix: (For starters, how did you get to be so totally whacked!?) Examine Security camera Phoenix: Smile for the camera... Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Or maybe he just doesn't get to see a lot of women like Miss May in here. Talk That \"man\" Phoenix: About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... April: ... Phoenix: Can you tell me about him? Where is he? C'mon... April: No way, Jose. Phoenix: (Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...) The wiretap Phoenix: Why did you place a wiretap on Mia's phone? April: Aww, when you say it like that it sounds so... cold. So criminal! Phoenix: Um... tapping people's phones is a crime, Miss May. April: Oh, and I suppose you learned that in Lawyer School, hmm? Creep! Phoenix: (This woman is impossible to talk to...) Your attitude Phoenix: Say... Why are you so... angry? I mean, you don't look like a bad person... April: Ooh, that does it! Bottom-feeding, scum-sucking lawyer! Phoenix: B-bottom...? (I can't tell, does she have a thing against lawyers... or just against me?) Present Anything April: Hey, guess what. Actually, I, um, really hate your guts. So get lost. Because, well, I'm not cooperating. Phoenix: (Thanks, I noticed.) September 7Fey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Looks like forensics is taking the day off today. Detective Gumshoe's nowhere in sight. The police really gave this place a working over. I doubt there are any valuable clues left. Suppose it can't hurt to take a look around, though. Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. All the cases that the chief worked on are filed here. Hmm. Are some of the files missing...? Nah, I'm imagining things. September 7Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: (Huh. Looks like Grossberg is out today... again. Maybe he's avoiding me for some reason?) Examine Photos on desk Phoenix: What's this? Old photos? There are two lying here. Something's been written in pencil on the backs. \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A,\" \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B\"... Let's take a look at these... \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A\" Phoenix: ... I'm sure I've seen this person somewhere... Perhaps I'll borrow this photo. I'm sure no one will miss just one little photo. And it might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. Photograph quietly added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B\" Phoenix: Why would Grossberg have a picture of this man...? This might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. I'm just borrowing it. I'll return it later. Photograph quietly added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination Leave them alone Phoenix: I don't need it now, whatever it is. If I ever run out of clues, I'll know where to find these. (Although I can't be sure the photos will still be here then...) Leads back to examination Photos on desk (after one has been added to the Court Record) Phoenix: A photo lies on the desk. Maybe I should switch it with the one I took? Swap photos Phoenix: I think I'll swap them... Photograph added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination Leave it alone Phoenix: No, on second thought, I'd better not. Leads back to examination Vacant wall Phoenix: Wait a second... Wasn't there a giant painting hanging on that wall...? Yeah... yeah, it was a painting of... Sunflowers Leads to: \"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.\" Marvin Grossberg Leads to: \"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.\" Fishermen Leads to: \"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.\" Phoenix: Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow. Detention Center (after visiting Grossberg Law Offices) April: YOU AGAIN!? Can't you take a hint and stay gone? Phoenix: Hey, the only reason I'm back here is because YOU won't talk to me! April: Oh, so it's MY fault now? You don't just have spiky hair, you also have a spiky heart. Phoenix: (That does it. When this case is done I'm shaving my head.) Talk That \"man\" Phoenix: About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... Can you tell me about him? Where is he? April: I'm not telling! Phoenix: Look, he's being accused of murder! I don't think you want to be protecting him. April: Hmm. Would you have sold out the late Ms. Fey to the cops? Phoenix: No. April: See? Phoenix: (Damn! Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...) Present Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A) Phoenix: Any thoughts about this photograph? April: ... Who's that? Your mother? Phoenix: (... *sigh* Looks like I've just been wasting my time.) Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Look, I've said several times, I'm not telling you...¬†! Where did you...? Phoenix: (Ah hah! A reaction!) This is him, isn't it? April: What? Who? When? Why...? Phoenix: It IS him. This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder! April: No! No, that's not right. Phoenix: (Nice try, Miss Cooperative.) April: D-do you have proof that was him? Hmm? Y-yeah! Proof! Show me proof! Phoenix: (I'm so close!) September 7Gatewater HotelRoom 303 Bellboy: Ah, welcome, sir! Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself. Phoenix: Oh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that. Bellboy: No, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's \"rep,\" as they say. Phoenix: Huh? \"Rep\"? Bellboy: Yes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir! Phoenix: Whoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder. Bellboy: I, too, will become famous! \"The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee\"...! Phoenix: (Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...) Bellboy: So! You are our honored guest. Please let me know if there is anything I can bring you! Examine Flowers Phoenix: A vase, as expected. I'm not good with flower names, except maybe tulips and sunflowers. Open drawer Phoenix: Huh? There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer! Bellboy: Ah, please leave that as it is, sir. That's the \"Drawer of Terror, Hiding Place of the Murderer's Wiretap.\" It's set to become one of the most popular attractions here. Phoenix: (This guy's serious! I don't believe it...) Table Phoenix: A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. Why hasn't he cleaned these up by now? Bellboy: Ah, I beg your pardon, sir, but if you could please refrain from touching those... It's part of the decor. I call it: \"The last drink... before murder!\" We'll be famous! The talk of the hotel industry! Window Phoenix: Nice weather again today. I can see the Fey & Co. Law Offices, of course. Bellboy: Ah, yes. We plan to install a telescope in that window, of course. Just $5.00 will earn you three minutes of a \"view to a kill\"! Phoenix: ... Bellboy: J-just kidding, sir. Oh hoh hoh hoh! Phoenix: (By that look in his eyes I'd say he was more than serious...) Talk Miss May Phoenix: About Miss May... Bellboy: Oh, her? Sir, not to boast but I knew the moment I saw her... \"She'd do it!\" I said! Phoenix: (Do WHAT!? I'm starting to think the most suspicious person here is this guy!) The man with May Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about the man who was with Miss May...? Bellboy: Ah, yes... He struck me as a real \"Lady Killer,\" if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger. Phoenix: (There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.) Bellboy: If you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him. Phoenix: (A photo. Hmm...) The hotel Phoenix: Could you tell me about this hotel? Bellboy: Absolutely! And on that subject, I have an excellent idea, sir! Currently, this hotel is known as the \"Gatewater.\" I propose that we add a subtitle! Phoenix: A subtitle!? Bellboy: The Gatewater Hotel -- Murder Manor -- Well? What do you think? Phoenix: Um... sounds great! (Whatever floats your tea set...) Present Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A) Phoenix: What about this photo? Bellboy: Well, it's a fine photo, sir. However, the person Miss May was accompanied by was, well, a man. Phoenix: (Oh... yeah. Right.) Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) Phoenix: Take a look at this photo. Bellboy: ... That's him, Detective. Phoenix: Um... I'm the lawyer. Bellboy: Oh, I know that! I just wanted to say \"Detective\" once. You know how it is. Phoenix: (No. No I don't.) Bellboy: Without a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him! Phoenix: An affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...) Have him write it Phoenix: Well, sure. Why not? Bellboy: Yes! I've always wanted to write an affidavit, sir. From hence forth I will be known as \"The Bellboy who swore the affidavit\"! (Changed from [From hence forth I will be known as the 'bellboy who swore the affidavit'!] in the original release) Phoenix: Just hurry up and write it. Bellboy's Affidavit added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (Not even Miss May can play dumb to this!) Leads back to Court Record Turn him down Phoenix: Well thanks, but I don't think that will be necessary. Bellboy: Oh? Oh, I see. Well later then, if you need it. Leads back to Court Record Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (after Bellboy's Affidavit is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Sorry to press the matter, but are you sure this is him? Bellboy: I, too, am sorry to press the matter, but that is him, Detective! Phoenix: Umm... thanks. Bellboy's Affidavit Phoenix: Thanks for this. Bellboy: No no no, not at all, sir! I hope you'll use it to take that Miss May down hard, sir! Hard! Phoenix: (Why do I sense an unhealthy level of excitement behind that unchanging smile? His tea set is rattling!) Anything else Bellboy: I'm sorry... All I could think about during the trial was the hotel... I wasn't paying much attention to the evidence. Grossberg Law Offices (after Bellboy's Affidavit is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: (*sigh* He's out again? Huh? No more photos on the desk...) Detention Center Present Bellboy's Affidavit Phoenix: Could you have a look at this? April: What's that? Phoenix: The bellboy's affidavit! He told us everything he saw. He told us about the man you checked in with. He told us who he was. April: ...! Phoenix: (Now I'm getting somewhere!) Ease her fears Phoenix: (Okay, okay... she's vulnerable now. I should be gentle.) Miss May... It would be easy for me to hand this affidavit to the police. April: ... Phoenix: If they get involved, wouldn't your boss be even more... er... inconvenienced? All I want to do is have a little chat with him. You won't tell me? April: ... Is that all you have to say? Phoenix: Yes. April: Id it's so easy for you to \"get the police involved,\" then why don't you? Somehow I think you're not up to it, hmm? Phoenix: (Show them a little kindness and they jump all over you! That had the opposite effect to what I hoped...) April: Aww. *smirk* Poor little lawyer... And you were so close! Phoenix: (This isn't working... I think I've worn out this piece of paper's usefulness.) Dammit! Bellboy's Affidavit discarded. (Changed from [Discarded the Bellboy's Affidavit.] in the original release) Phoenix: (The man in this photo is the one I want! Why did April May not want to talk about it... she must know him!) Leads back to Court Record Push her hard Phoenix: (This is it, all or nothing! Time to do a little bluff.) No use playing dumb! (If, indeed, that's an act.) If you don't talk, I'm taking this photo to the press! April: Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: Even though he should've been witness to murder, your little \"friend\" is missing. (Changed from [Even though he should be a witness to murder, this man is in hiding.] in the original release) I'm sure the press would have a field day with his reputation! April: ...! Ooooh! Fine! I'll talk! You... you win, Lawyer. Phoenix: (Yes! Man, that felt good! It's great to be alive!) April: Why are you pumping your fists in the air? Phoenix: *cough* Now, tell me about the man you were with. April: That man... He's my boss. Redd White, the president of the information gathering conglomerate, Bluecorp. Phoenix: (Redd... White?) \"Information gathering?\" April: Well... I suppose you could call it a detective agency. (Changed from [Well... I suppose you could call them a detective agency.] in the orignal release) Phoenix: Hmm... So this is the man that was with you the night of the murder? April: ... I'm... I'm scared to talk. I don't want to end up like her! Phoenix: (...!) It's okay, I'll just ask Mr. White himself. Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located? April: ... Phoenix: (Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! If April May couldn't have done it, that leaves him! Time to take action!) Bellboy's Affidavit discarded. (Changed from [Discarded the Bellboy's Affidavit.] in the original release) Leads back to Court Record Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (after presenting Bellboy's Affidavit) Phoenix: How about this photograph? April: You're wasting your time! Miss May's lips are sealed! Gatewater Hotel (after presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: Hmm. The bellboy seems to be out. Huh? The sound of water coming from the shower... Bellboy: \"La-dee-da! Money-Makin'... Money-Makin'... I got the Money-Makin' bluuuues...\" Phoenix: Someone seems to enjoy washing the showers. Examine Open drawer Phoenix: The screwdriver is still stuck in the drawer. I'd better not touch it. No telling what the bellboy would do to me. Table Phoenix: A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. I'd better not touch them. No telling what the bellboy would do to me. Grossberg Law Offices (after presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: (Alright, this is getting ridiculous. Where the heck is that loafer?) Grossberg: *Ah-HHHHEM!* Phoenix: (Ah, that old familiar clearing of the throat...) Grossberg: Ah hah! You again. Phoenix: Um, hello, Mr. Grossberg. Grossberg: ... Well, well. You were quite the thing, my boy. Phoenix: Excuse me...? Grossberg: The trial! The trial! Phoenix: (He was there...?) Grossberg: Reminded me of myself when I was a youth! Phoenix: (I guess something got passed down through Mia... maybe?) Grossberg: It brings back memories, it does! \"Ah... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon...\" you see. ... I apologize. Phoenix: ? Grossberg: I... It was all a bit too much for me, my boy. Seeing you today, I... well, I... ... Phoenix: (I appreciate the reminiscing, but I'd much rather you gave me some information!) Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So you came to see the trial? Grossberg: Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see. I couldn't get a wink of sleep. Phoenix: Really? What was that? Grossberg: Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl. Phoenix: (If you were that worried about it, why didn't you offer to defend her!?) Your refusal Phoenix: I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know. Grossberg: A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy. Phoenix: ... (He does seem troubled about something... Maybe I can find something that will inspire him to talk.) That painting Phoenix: The other day I'm sure there was a big, pretentious-looking painting on that wall... Grossberg: \"Pretentious-looking\"...? Phoenix: Well... you know the one I mean. Anyway, where did it go? Grossberg: Ah, yes, well... I... got rid of it. Got quite tired of the thing, really. I, er, sold it, you see. Yes, that's right. Phoenix: (Sold it!? I'm not sure I buy that...) Wasn't that painting rather important to you, sir? Did something happen? Grossberg: I don't see how it's any of your business! Please, speak no more of that accursed painting. I didn't... I... *mumble* *mumble* Any option (after presenting Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)) Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg...? Grossberg: ... Ah, my apologies. I need to think about things. Alone. Phoenix: (He barely even glanced in my direction...) Present Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (if \"Ease her fears\" was selected upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph... Grossberg: ...! Where did you get that!? Phoenix: I borrowed it. Grossberg: Well, give it back at once! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg. Tell me about the man in this photo. He may have been in that hotel room with April May on the night of the murder. Do you know something about him... anything? Grossberg: ...! Hmm. Ahem! Very well. I'll tell you what I know. However... You didn't hear it from me, if you follow. Phoenix: I follow. Grossberg: That man is Mr. Redd White. He's the President of Bluecorp. Phoenix: (Redd White... Hmm.) Bluecorp... they're something like a detective agency, right? Grossberg: They're information pros. They sell information, you see. Sensitive information. Despite his name, Mr. White has the blackest reputation of any man in this country. Should you run across him, watch what you say. You wouldn't want him digging up any dirt on you. Phoenix: (Hmm... selling information. Sounds like blackmail.) Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located? Grossberg: Hmm... I suppose. Phoenix: (Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! Even if April May couldn't have done it, he could have! Time to take action!) Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg. Grossberg: Now, I must ask you to leave. I need to think about things. Alone. Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (if \"Push her hard\" was selected upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph... Grossberg: Where did you get that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I'm sorry to have taken it without your knowledge. But... I have to know. Who is this man? He was most likely in April May's room the night of the murder. Grossberg: ! What's that you say!? A-are you QUITE sure? My boy? Phoenix: (What has him so flustered I wonder...?) Grossberg: I... I beg your pardon, but I must ask you to leave. I need to be alone. Phoenix: (...! He's fallen silent as a stone. A rather large stone. I guess I should return that photo.) Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg. Anything else Grossberg: I beg your pardon, but I am not at liberty to speak on the matter. After selecting \"Push her hard\" upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, or selecting \"Ease her fears\" upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, then presenting Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) in Grossberg Law Offices: September 7Bluecorp Inc.CEO's Office Phoenix: ... (What's with the surreal d√©cor...?) ???: Welcome! Please furnish me with the title of your personage! Phoenix: (What the...?) White: Your name! What's your name? I was just inquirably asking the title that you go by. Phoenix: Uh... Wright. Phoenix Wright. (\"Inquirably\"...?) White: Mr. Wright, is it? Right, I see... Splendiferous. Perhaps I have intimidated you with my giantesque vocabulary...? Phoenix: (What is this guy's problem!) White: I'm Redd White, CEO of Bluecorp. You know, Corporate Expansion Official? My business dealings bring me into contact with the elite of the elite. So I'm afraid I am not used to conversing with the wordily-challenged. Phoenix: (What a fruitcake!) White: Hmmm, let me guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this! Phoenix: (What does he mean by that?) White: No matter. So, what business does a \"mighty\" lawyer have with a man such as myself? Phoenix: (Yipes! This guy's arrogance meter is off the scale!) Examine Desk Phoenix: I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing. White: It is modeled on my body, see? Well? Does its sleek roundature not... inspire you? Painting Phoenix: ...? Haven't I seen this somewhere...? Is this a replica? White: Ridiculosity! I have no interest in anything but originals. That right there is a bona fide original! Worth five million, for sure. Phoenix: Hmmm... Statue Phoenix: A statue of a man holding up the world. The \"Bluecorp\" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White. White: Truly a work of art! But, probably to beautacious for you to appreciate, correct? Phoenix: (I think it's a little too \"beautacious\" for just about anyone to appreciate.) Trophy display Phoenix: An impressive line-up of trophies. \"Judges Special Runner-up\" \"Best Participation\" \"Judges Cooperation Award\" \"Special Good Try Prize\" Hmm. The words \"Judges\" and \"Special\" kind of stand out. Window Phoenix: This is the top floor of a 20-story building. The view is quite... presidential. Talk Miss May Phoenix: Miss May is an employee of Bluecorp, is she not? White: Correct. She was my secretariat. What a shock it was to hear what she has done! Phoenix: \"What she has done\"... You mean the wiretap? White: Indeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods! It is ineffable that she would do this. Phoenix: (It sounds like he's trying to turn Miss May into a scapegoat...) Night of the murder Phoenix: On the night of the murder were you in April May's hotel room? White: Who can say? I seldom pay attention to mundane details such as time and place. My motto is: \"Don't worry, be happy!\" Phoenix: Still, Mr. White... The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly. White: ... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that. Phoenix: (Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have \"seen\" the same thing as April May!) White: Oh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement! Bluecorp Phoenix: What kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway? White: Ah, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information. We are a company of the future! You might say, we ARE the future! Phoenix: (Sell... information?) White: In just 10 years, I've built this business up into the grand office you see now. Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color \"blue\"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course! Fantabulistic, is it not? That painting (appears after \"Miss May\" and \"Night of the murder\") Phoenix: Uh... there's something that's been bothering me. White: Yes? What might that be? Phoenix: That big painting on the wall over there... It's gorgeous Phoenix: It's a very striking piece of art. White: Magnificentatious, isn't it! Phoenix: Yeah. ... (Why am I making small talk...?) Leads back to Talk options I've seen it before Phoenix: You know, I've actually seen that painting before. White: Oh? Phoenix: Just yesterday, actually. White: Your point being...? Phoenix: My point is simple. Er, rather, my question is simple: Why is that painting hanging on your wall? Leads to: \"...\" When did you get it? Phoenix: Say, when did you get that painting? White: ... Hmm... no idea! I forgot! Phoenix: I've seen that painting before. Yesterday, in fact. Why do I find that painting here today? Leads to: \"...\" Present Wiretap Phoenix: About this wiretap... White: Ah, the one that Miss May used, right? Bad girl. Bad, bad girl. Phoenix: She testified that she placed the wiretap at your request. White: How pathetic. I guess she's trying to pass the buck. Bad, bad girl. Sorry I can't help you. I know nothing. Phoenix: (I'm going to need hard evidence to get anything out of this guy...) Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) Phoenix: About this picture... White: Gorgeous! That's a picture of me! Ah, I see it was taken in the prime of my youth. About 10 years ago, at a guess. Phoenix: The hotel bellboy says he saw this man on the night of the murder. White: ... On closer inspection, he does look a lot like me, but I'm afraid this is someone else. Nope. That's definitely not me. He's far too young. Anything else White: I am terribly sorry. But that really doesn't seem to concern me at all. White: ... Mr. Wrong, was it? Phoenix: Wright. White: It appears you do not fully grasp your position here. I ask again. Who are you? Phoenix: Umm... huh? A lawyer? White: No, my feeble friend. A \"mere\" lawyer. Worth nothing. Zilch. Zippo. Nada! Just like that sorry excuse for an attorney, Grodyburger! Phoenix: (Wh-what!?) Ungh! Oof...! Unh... uhhh... (He... he punched me!) White: Well, Mr. Lawyer. What will you do, eh? Charge me with assault? Charge away, I welcome it! For it is YOU who will be found guilty! Phoenix: What...? White: Heed my exposition! The police, the courts, they all do my bidding. Phoenix: (So you say... But I wonder... Is that kind of control really possible?) White: I don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume? Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg's... yes. White: Then you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you? Perhaps he will explain how a man can live life purely for personal profit! ... Go now! Skedaddle! There is nothing more to discuss! Examine Desk Phoenix: I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing. Painting Phoenix: This painting was, until yesterday, hanging in Mr. Grossberg's office. Why does White have it now? It's not hard to imagine a few possibilities. Statue Phoenix: A statue of a man holding up the world. The \"Bluecorp\" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White. Trophy display Phoenix: An impressive line-up of trophies. \"Judges Special Runner-up\" \"Best Participation\" \"Judges Cooperation Award\" \"Special Good Try Prize\" Hmm. The words \"Judges\" and \"Special\" kind of stand out. He probably strong-armed them into giving him something. Talk Any option White: Would you be kind enough to cease your inane chattering and vacate the premises? Let me put it in language you are sure to understand: Shut up and get out! I have nothing more to say. Present Anything White: Would you be kind enough to cease your inane chattering and vacate the premises? Let me put it in language you are sure to understand: Shut up and get out! I have nothing more to say. Detention Center (after visiting Bluecorp) Phoenix: Apparently, Miss May is in questioning. I doubt they'll let me talk to her today. Examine Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Grossberg Law Offices (after selecting \"\"I've seen it before\" or \"When did you get it?\" upon selecting \"That painting\" Talk option in Bluecorp) Grossberg: ... ... ... Phoenix: (Huh? I don't think he's noticed me standing here. Maybe I should... clear my throat?) Aaa-HHHEM! Grossberg: Jumping Jehosephats! Oh! You! Phoenix: What's wrong? You looked so pensive... like an old man at the end of his days. Grossberg: Hmm? I'm not senile yet! I was just thinking about this whole mess... Phoenix: (Something's really bothering him, that much is clear.) Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So you came to see the trial? Grossberg: Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see, couldn't get a wink of sleep. Phoenix: Really? What was that? Grossberg: Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl. Your refusal Phoenix: I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know. Grossberg: A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy. Phoenix: ... (He does seem troubled about something... I'm starting to have a feeling I know what it is.) Mr. White Phoenix: So, I paid Bluecorp a visit. Grossberg: Oh? Oh, I see. Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg... I have to admit, something has been bothering me. Grossberg: Oh? What is it? Well, out with it, my boy! Phoenix: You see, it's just... That big painting Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had \"no intention of parting with\"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office. Grossberg: ... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting... Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, I know you and Mr. White are connected somehow! Grossberg: C-connected, you say? Phoenix: Yes! And I know what it is... He's giving you information Phoenix: You're his client, aren't you? He's giving you information! Grossberg: What's that now? Phoenix: You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services! Grossberg: ... Phoenix: You gave him that painting in exchange for some valuable information, didn't you? Grossberg: Utterly ridiculous. Me, his client? I would never willingly deal with that man. Never! Phoenix: (Huh? Did I get it wrong?) Leads back to Talk options He's blackmailing you Phoenix: Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail? Grossberg: ...! Phoenix: I think that painting is fairly gaudy proof. Grossberg: ... Very well. This may be the chance I've been waiting for. Maybe it's time to get this off my chest, so I can finally rest easy again. After all, you were Mia's understudy. Perhaps it was fate? Phoenix: (What's he talking about...?) Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" You're lovers Phoenix: It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you! Grossberg: W-w-what! My boy! Phoenix: You sent that painting to him! As a sign! A sign of undying love! Grossberg: M-m-my boy, please! You're letting your fancies run away with you! Where do you get these bizarre ideas? Phoenix: I... I don't understand how you could... Grossberg: That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous! ... Enough. I'll swallow my pride and tell you all. Phoenix: (I knew it! They are lovers!) Grossberg: N-no! We are NOT lovers! Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" That photo of Mr. White Phoenix: That photo of Mr. White... Why would you have his photo, Mr. Grossberg? Grossberg: Umm... yes, well. It's been a long time since then... Phoenix: A long time ago? I'm sorry... but I think not. I think you still have ties to Mr. White even today. Grossberg: R-really! Whatever gave you that idea! W-what connection could I possibly have to an individual such as he? Phoenix: It's pretty straightforward, actually... You go drinking together Phoenix: You go drinking together! You're friends, aren't you? Grossberg: ... Now you're being foolish, my boy. Why in the world would I ever drink with the likes of him!? Phoenix: (Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.) Leads back to Talk options He's blackmailing you Phoenix: Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail? Grossberg: ...! I don't... I don't know what you're talking about! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had \"no intention of parting with\"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office. Grossberg: ... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting... Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg... tell me what happened. Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" He's giving you information Phoenix: Redd White is supplying you with information, obviously! Grossberg: What's that now? Phoenix: You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services! Grossberg: ... Now you're being foolish, my boy. What possible use could I have for the services of the likes of him!? Phoenix: (Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.) Leads back to Talk options Why wouldn't you defend Maya? Phoenix: I thought it was strange. Here was Maya, your own apprentice's little sister, in desperate need... Accused of killing her own sister no less, and you wouldn't take the case! I finally realized why. You and Redd White are connected. He's... Your boss Phoenix: I'll bet you and White go way back! He's your boss now, and was before, I bet! Grossberg: My what? Boss? Are you serious? Phoenix: Yeah! You both have that sort of \"we're in the same club together\" feel to you. Grossberg: Please, stop. You have a very peculiar sense of humor, Mr. Wright. Very well, I'll talk. Phoenix: (What does he mean... \"sense of humor\"? I was serious!) Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" Blackmailing you Phoenix: Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail? Grossberg: ...! I don't... I don't know what you're talking about! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had \"no intention of parting with\"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office. Grossberg: ... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting... Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg... tell me what happened.

Grossberg: W-w-what! My boy! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg. The other day, there was a giant painting hanging on that wall. I saw that painting again, today. It was in the CEO's office of Bluecorp. It was a present, wasn't it? Grossberg: Well, my boy, you have a splendid imagination! Phoenix: I... I don't understand how you could... Grossberg: That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous! Phoenix: (Hmm... I guess I was wrong. But it just seemed so right!) Leads back to Talk options Present Anything Grossberg: Sorry, my boy. I don't think I can help you with that. Grossberg: Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now... Phoenix: (15 years...!) Grossberg: All because of the \"DL-6 Incident,\" as you may have guessed. Phoenix: (The name on the back of those photographs!) Grossberg: As you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did. Phoenix: (So that's the connection!) Grossberg: It is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible. Phoenix: Impossible? Why!? Grossberg: He has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians. Phoenix: What!? Grossberg: They are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years. Talk The DL-6 Incident Phoenix: What is the \"DL-6 Incident\"? Grossberg: \"DL-6\" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium. Phoenix: (A medium...?) Grossberg: Her name was Misty Fey. Phoenix: (Fey!) Grossberg: Indeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud. Phoenix: (This is what Maya was talking about the other day!) Grossberg: I did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident. Reason for blackmail Phoenix: But why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg? Grossberg: The DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him. Phoenix: You told White? Grossberg: He offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail. Phoenix: ... I see. Grossberg: ... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office. Phoenix: Mia's office...? Grossberg: She followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found. Fey & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Reason for blackmail\" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices) Phoenix: It's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look. Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: All the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here. They're in alphabetical order. Let's take a look... Which file should I look at...? File \"A-I\" Phoenix: Let's see if there's \"A\" record in this file that catches my \"I.\" \"A\"... \"B\"... \"F\"! \"Misty Fey.\" That's Mia and Maya's mother. Hmmm... Should I take a look? Read it Mia: \"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press. This parasite, who makes his fortune on threats and coercion... His name is...\" Phoenix: Hmm. The record stops there. ... So Mia knew Grossberg... Leads back to examination Leave it be Phoenix: I don't think it has much to do with the current case. I'd be interested to know what it contains... but I'll leave it alone for now. Leads back to examination File \"J-S\" Phoenix: Let's see... \"J\" through \"S\"... Nothing much in here. Maybe I'll just skim some of this? Skim Phoenix: *sigh* Well, no harm in flipping through a bit, I guess... The biggest part's here at the end in \"S\"... \"Suicide\"? Eww... She has a collection of suicide reports. There's politicians... policemen... ... ...! There's writing on most of these in pencil. \"White\"...? This is Mia's handwriting. Wait, I get it! Mia thought he was involved in these \"suicides\"! White drove them all to... ... I can use these newspaper clippings. Hmm... let's find the most disturbing one... Newspaper Clipping added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination Leave it be Phoenix: Nah... this is taking too long. Later. *yawn* I've never been good at reading these things. Leads back to examination File \"T-Z\" Phoenix: \"T\"... \"U\"... I know, \"W\"! \"White\"! ...¬†! The entire \"W\" section is missing! Was it taken...? Leads back to examination Bookshelf (after Newspaper Clipping is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Shall I check Mia's files once more? Check 'em Phoenix: Which file to check? File \"J-S\" Phoenix: Hmm... not much in the \"J-S\" section. I'm not sure reading suicide accounts will be very good for my mood... I think that's enough reading for today. Leads back to examination Leave 'em Phoenix: I don't see much point in checking files that are missing all the key parts. *yawn* I give up. Leads back to examination Grossberg Law Offices Present Newspaper Clipping Phoenix: I found this in Mia's files... Grossberg: So she was investigating Redd White, as I expected. Well, if you wanted to challenge him, you could present this in court. Phoenix: (Not a bad idea...) Bluecorp (after Newspaper Clipping is added to the Court Record) White: Well, aren't you persistent. Phoenix: Sorry, but there's something I have to ask you. White: Mr. Lawyer, I really hate having to repeat myself... But it seems the message has not yet penetrated your thick skull... Stop bothering me! If you try my patience further, I fear a nasty accident may occur. Do I make myself clear? Phoenix: (Transparent...) Talk Miss May Phoenix: (I think we're past needing to talk about April May. I've got to put this guy on the spot, and quick!) White: Hmm? What's the matter? You seem... distressed! Night of the murder Phoenix: (This guy is a pro at pulling the wool over people's eyes. I've got to put him on the spot, and quick!) White: Stop that! Your hot gaze is giving me goosebumps! Blackmail Phoenix: (There's no point asking someone this crooked a straight question! I need some evidence I can use as ammo...) White: What's wrong? Is something stuck to my face? Why yes! There's my eyes, and my nose, and my mouth... But of course I jest. You need not restrain your mirth, my friend! It is okay to indulge in my cosmopolitan sense of humor. I will not think less of you. Present Newspaper Clipping Phoenix: (This is the only clue that Mia left me... I'd better make this one count!) Mr. White... see this? It's an article describing the suicide of a politician. White: ... Phoenix: He was embezzling secret government funds. Then, one day, word got leaked to the press. The very next day he took his own life. White: And this concerns me how...? Phoenix: I found this article in Mia's office. White: Miss Mia...? Phoenix: She had a file filled with articles like this. Every one of them was labeled with a single word... \"White.\" White: ...! Phoenix: Mr. White, I know what you did to this politician. You bribed him Phoenix: You bribed him! White: B-bribed!? ... What exactly has led you to say this? Phoenix: (Um... gee, that's a good question. I guess I got ahead of myself there...) White: Hmph. You certainly have an active imagination. Phoenix: (Dammit!) Leads back to Court Record You spied on him Phoenix: You were spying on him, weren't you? White: \"Spying\"...? Phoenix: You snooped on him, and found out about the embezzlement. Then, when you revealed it, he was driven to suicide! White: Mr. Lawyer. I know nothing of this. And, even in the highly unlikely event that I did do such a thing... All I would have done is provide \"information.\" That is not a crime in this country. Phoenix: (Gah! This guy's as cool as a cucumber...!) Leads back to Court Record You blackmailed him Leads to: \"You were blackmailing him!\" Anything else White: I have no intention of parleying with you about this matter. Phoenix: You were blackmailing him! White: Blackmail? Phoenix: Not just him, either. You were threatening and coercing hundreds of others! You were involved in all of the suicide cases that Mia investigated! This company is built on blackmail! I'm right, aren't I? White: What a bizarre accusation. Mr. Wrong... What is it that you should be doing now? Investigating me? No no no. I think not! You should be searching for the one who killed Miss Mia! Interphone: *beep* [Secretary's Office, hello?] White: Mr. Wrong will be leaving now. Interphone: [Yes, sir. I'll send someone right away.] Phoenix: Wait a second, Mr. White... You're right Phoenix: You are absolutely right. I should be looking for the killer now. And actually, I've done better. I've found him. He's sitting right in front of me. Leads to: \"Just what are you insinuating?\" You're wrong Phoenix: You're wrong, Mr. White. White: Excuse me? Phoenix: What I should be doing now is going after you! Leads to: \"Just what are you insinuating?\" White: Just what are you insinuating? Phoenix: Mia was on to you. She was keeping tabs. For this reason you had April May tapping her phone. Then, Mia was murdered, and all the documents about you mysteriously disappeared. So, the culprit would be...? White: ... Phoenix: Even a child could work it out, Mr. White. You did it! White: ... Interphone: *beep* [Secretary's office.] White: We won't be needing an escort for Mr. Wrong. Instead, please connect me to the public prosecutor's office. Interphone [Of course, sir. One moment please...] ... [White? That you? What are you doing calling me at a time like this!?] White: Hello. Chief Prosecutor? I've changed my mind. I want to testify tomorrow. Interphone: [What's this about?] White: The Mia Fey case. I witnessed the murder, you see. And, thus, as a very important witness, I would like to testify. Interphone: [What? Why now? I thought you said you didn't want to go to court?] White: Quietude...! I told you I changed my mind, didn't I? Oh, and one other thing. Send the police over here right away. The man is standing right in front of me. He looks dazed but could be violent! Interphone: [What? What man?] White: Are you even listening? The executioner! The hatchet-man! The liquidator... The killer, man! Phoenix: What!? Interphone: [Mr. White... this isn't another one of those...] White: Chief Prosecutor. I do not believe you are in a position to freely offer your opinions to me, correct? I'm telling you to send the police, now! Interphone: *beep* White: ... Did I not tell you, Mr. Wrong? You are a mere lawyer! As was Miss Mia. Phoenix: How dare you! White: I'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled. No lawyer of any worth will defend you. I have friends in the local lawyer's association, you see. You'll be given a lawyer so stupendously inept that they make even you look competent. Phoenix: (I... I feel faint.) Gumshoe: Detective Gumshoe, reporting, sir! Aaa! Butz! Hairy Butz! Phoenix: Wright, actually. Phoenix Wright. And my friend's name is \"Larry\"... Gumshoe: Oh, right! Sorry, pal. Butz was that murderer, right? White: Detective Gumshoe. I present to you, the man who killed Miss Mia Fey! Gumshoe: W-what!? White: Take this despicable human being into custody. ... Farewell, Mr. Wrong! September 8, 3:37 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: I can't believe it's only been a day since the first trial. My trial begins tomorrow. White's going to set a trap for me. And the prosecution will be in on it, of course. Edgeworth, included. An attorney was assigned to me by the state, yesterday. I refused. I had an idea. Maya: ... Wright! Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Oh, Maya! Great, they let you out of detention. Maya: Just now, yes. It's all thanks to you! Phoenix: Hah. Now I'm afraid we've switched places. Maya: What? You mean, you...? Phoenix: I explained what had happened to Maya. ... Maya: I don't believe it! How many people does that man need to destroy before he's satisfied!? My mother... My sister... And now you! This has gone too far! Mr. Wright, please tell me, is there anything I can do? Phoenix: Um... well... Defend me in court Phoenix: Alright, you can be my defense lawyer tomorrow! Maya: Alright! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Leave it to me! I am Mia's sister, after all! Lawyership runs in our blood! Phoenix: (Wasn't it ghost powers that ran in your blood...?) (Changed from [Wasn't it E.S.P. that ran in your blood...?] in the original release) Maya: I'd better run to the bookstore and pick up a copy of \"Law for Rookies.\" Leads to: \"...\" Cheer me on in court Phoenix: Well, you could cheer for me in court. Maya: Cheer for you? You mean... like a cheerleader? Phoenix: Huh? Um, yeah, like that. Maya: Alright! Leave it to me! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: I'd better go get a uniform and some pom-poms...! Leads to: \"...\" Help me break out of here Phoenix: Right. Okay, listen up. I want you to help me break out of here! Maya: You mean... a jail break? Phoenix: Yeah. Tonight's our only chance! Maya: Alright! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Oh, I'd better go get a hacksaw while the stores are still open. Oh, oh! And a rope ladder, and a getaway car! Can you drive? Leads to: \"...\" Phoenix: ... W-wait. Wait wait wait. Maya: What what what? Phoenix: I'm kidding! It was a joke! Maya: No way! Phoenix: No really, I was kidding. But thanks. It's good to know you're on my side. (And there really isn't anything you can do for me anyway...) Maya: But... but I can't just sit here and do nothing! I've got to give that man a piece of my mind! Phoenix: (Just a piece...?) Okay. Then, come to the court tomorrow. Maya: O-okay! I'll be there! I'll show them a thing or two! Phoenix: Times may change, yet with crime it's the same old story. (Changed from [It's the beginning of a new century, yet with crime it's the same old story.] in the original release) In fact, it's gotten worse. Lengthy court proceedings are no longer realistic. Beginning a few years ago, a limit of three days was put on initial court trials. Almost all finish in a day. Most with a guilty verdict. I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself for this case. (Changed from [I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself.] in the original release) With the true culprit appearing as the star witness. (Changed from [Tomorrow the true culprit will appear as a witness.] in the original release) This is it! Tomorrow, it's me or him! (Changed from [This is it! It's me or him!] in the original release) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here.\n-- She Ran to the \"Left\" --White: Miss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you mean by that! White: That is what I am about to explain! You Americans, always so impatient! It does not become you. Phoenix: (Hey buddy, you're an American, too!)White: When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you mean \"first\"? White: \"First\"? That is what comes before what happens \"next.\" You do speak English, right? Please, sit back, relax. I will try to use simple words for your benefit. First, she ran to the left, and then...White: And then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I didn't hit anyone! White: Now, now, Mr. Wright. There is no point hiding things from this court. Phoenix: I'm not hiding anything! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The prosecution requests that the defense refrain from interrupting the testimony! Judge: Mr. Wright, you have been warned. Phoenix: (Why's he mad at me!?)White: Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you mean \"next\"!? White: \"Next\" is what comes after \"first.\" Phoenix: I know that! White: Then that is all you need to know, Mr. Lawyer. As I said, she turned and made a desperate dash to the right.Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. White!\"White: You chased her, and delivered the final blow.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Stop saying it was me! White: But, it was you. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright! If you claim that it was NOT you, then show us proof! Phoenix: (Argh! Can I do nothing right? Nothing!?) White: May I continue?Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. White!\"White: That is what Miss May saw.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So each of you saw different parts...?

White: Anyway, moving along!Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. White!\"White: You see? You hit her twice!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So were you watching both times? White: I suppose I was. And please excuse me for not testifying to this sooner!Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. White!\"Maya: What do you think Phoenix?Phoenix: I think we've got him right where we want him! He slipped! Let him laugh for now. I'll soon wipe that smile off his face!Phoenix: Mr. White! The victim died from a single blow! ([single] was in quotation marks in the original release)White: ...!Phoenix: What do you have to say to that?White: Er... Erp!Phoenix: (Now's my chance to hit him where it counts!) Mr. White. Wasn't it you who told this court you were \"abso-posi-lutely perfect\"?White: Mmph. I will refrain from using this phrase from now on.Phoenix: Your Honor, if you could ask the witness for a new testimony...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: The witness is obviously confused, Your Honor! I would like to request a 10 minute break!Judge: Yes... yes, quite.Phoenix:Phoenix: The witness is confused because he's lying! I emphatically request that there be no break, Your Honor!(Yeah! We want justice...!) (Don't let him get away!)Judge: Very well. If the witness would care to revise his testimony...Phoenix: (The crowd's on my side! No slipping out of this now, White!)Judge: Mr. White?White: O... okay...Witness Testimony-- The Two Accounts --White: Umm, well, see--I looked at the other window when I heard that thing fall. Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left! The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged. Umm... and then... She turned, and ran for the door! Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!Judge: Hmm. \"Thwap\" indeed. Very well, you may begin the cross-examination.White: Mr. Your Honor... My stomach, you see, it is hurting...Phoenix: Deal with it. This is almost over.White: ...!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Two Accounts --White: Umm, well, see--I looked at the other window when I heard that thing fall.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You heard \"that thing fall\"? What exactly was \"that thing\"? White: Huh? Oh... oh, that? Umm... the glass light stand! Phoenix: (Right... the one that had fallen over at the scene.) Maya: Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as odd? Yeah, very odd Phoenix: (Yeah, that is odd. I'll press further.) Mr. White. White: Huh? W-what? Phoenix: You're saying you saw the glass light stand? White: Y-yes. Phoenix: Then change your testimony to reflect that! White: S-sorry. My bad... Judge: The witness will revise his testimony. White: Okay okay. Of course. Changes statement from \"Umm, well, see--I looked at the other window when I heard that thing fall.\" to \"A light stand was lying on the floor when I looked.\" Nope Phoenix: Huh? No, not really. Please continue your cross-examination. Leads back to cross-examinationWhite: A light stand was lying on the floor when I looked.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The \"glass stand was lying on the floor\"? That's the first I've heard of this. Why didn't you tell us about the stand before? White: W-why? Me? W-well... I was instructed not to... wait! One moment! Give me a minute to gather my thoughts. I am so... so confused. Phoenix: (White's falling apart.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! Please, I ask that you do not allow the witness to be badgered any further! Judge: M-Mr. Wright. Please refrain from badgering the witness... Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. (Edgeworth is on the ropes!) Judge: Very well. The witness may continue his account.Present Glass Shards Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. White. It was impossible for you to have seen the light stand! White: Whaaaat!? Phoenix: The stand broke into pieces when it fell! White: Ooof! Phoenix: Just by seeing the broken pieces you would have no idea it was a light stand! So tell me, exactly when was it that you saw the stand? Answer the question! White: ...! I-isn't it obvious? I saw the stand before it fell over! Phoenix: So... you saw the stand before the victim was attacked, then? White: C-correct! That would be no problemo, right? Phoenix: (Hmm...) No problemo Phoenix: Right. I guess there isn't a problem. Judge: Very well. Now... Maya: Ph-Phoenix! Wait! Phoenix: Huh? What? Maya: He saw the stand through the office window before it fell over... That's what he's saying, right? Phoenix: Yeah, I guess so. Maya: How could that be possible? Phoenix: Huh...? Why not? Maya: There's no way he could have seen it! And you have proof! Phoenix: ... Oh! Judge: Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Sorry, Your Honor! I guess there is a problemo, er, I mean, a problem. Judge: I see. Please try to think before you speak, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Sorry, Your Honor. But, I have proof! Leads to: \"A person in the hotel could not have seen the stand before it fell over!\" Big problemo Phoenix: There's a big problemo, er, I mean problem here. White: What problem is this? Phoenix: Mr. White, let me make sure I have this straight... You saw the glass light stand through the window, from the hotel... before the incident occurred? White: Correct! That is so! It's conclusive, definitive, undeniable... unimpeachable! Phoenix: No, it's impossible! You couldn't have seen the stand! Judge: What? Why couldn't he? You have proof? Phoenix: I sure do, Your Honor! Leads to: \"A person in the hotel could not have seen the stand before it fell over!\" Phoenix: A person in the hotel could not have seen the stand before it fell over!

I don't think that's what you meant. Phoenix: (I don't think so either.) Judge: Mr. Wright. The courtroom is no place to play practical jokes. Phoenix: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Let me try that again. Leads back to: \"A person in the hotel could not have seen the stand before it fell over!\"Present Floor Plans Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. White. It was impossible for you to have seen the glass stand! White: Whaaaat!? Leads to: \"Look at this!\"White: Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Miss Mia\"...? Mr. White, did you know the victim personally? White: No no no, triple no! How would I? How could I! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I see nothing odd about the witness knowing the name of the victim. Mr. Wright! I will not have you harrying the witness! Phoenix: (You're looking a little flustered, Edgeworth!)White: The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Now before, you said that she was hit before she ran. White: Y-yes, I must have been confused. But don't worry! We all know what happened now.White: She turned, and ran for the door!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What did you do then? White: I gave chase, of course! ...! No! No! Not me. Th-the killer, I mean! He gave chase! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. White, please try to remain calm. Mr. Wright here is only trying to fluster you with baseless accusations! White: Oh... oh right. Thank you, Miles.White: Then you did her in with a single blow!

Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask. ???: I know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you? Mia: Sharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here. ???: I gotcha. So, what is it this time? Mia: It's... a clock. ???: A clock? Mia: Yeah, it's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys. ???: Hey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis! Mia: Now, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now. ???: Huh? It's not working? That's lame! Mia: I had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead. ???: Papers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes. Mia: Can you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then. ???: Okay, Sis, but I expect dinner! Something good! Like... burgers! I could really go for a good burger. Mia: Okay, okay. We'll hit the usual joint. ???: Alright! It's a deal! Okay, Sis, see you soon! Mia: Yep. I'll be waiting, Maya. Cellular: *beep* [Conversation recorded. September 5, 9:27 AM] September 5, 8:57 PMFey & Co. Law Offices ???: Now, Miss Fey, I'll take what's mine... the papers. Mia: I'm sorry, but I can't give you what I don't have. ???: Miss Fey, you are a poor liar. Why, I see it right over there... That must be \"The Thinker\" that swallowed those papers. Mia: How could you know...? ???: Ho hoh. You are not cogniferous of my background? Gathering information is my business, you see. Mia: I... I should have been more careful. ???: Ho hoh. My dear Miss Fey... I am so very sorry. But I am afraid I must ask you for one more thing. Your eternal silence... Farewell, Miss Fey. Mia: !!! Red... White... Blue... Episode 2Turnabout Sisters September 5, 9:08 PMFey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Uh oh, I'm late. Huh, that's strange. The chief must have gone home already. She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!) Examine Anywhere Phoenix: I smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay! Phoenix: That smell... Blood! ???: ... *sob* Sis... Phoenix: (Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...? Chief!!! Phoenix: Who are you? ???: ... Phoenix: (The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.) Phoenix: Chief... Examine Broken glass Phoenix: Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand. Chair Phoenix: The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too. Mia Fey's body Phoenix: Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. \"The Thinker\" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon. The Thinker added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room. Glass Shards added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be? Mia Fey's body (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly. \"Maya\" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices) Phoenix: ! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday. Receipt added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.) \"Maya\" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; after clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices) Phoenix: ! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday. (Wait a second! \"Maya\"...! Was Mia trying to tell us something about that girl? I think I'd better show her this receipt. I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom!) Receipt added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.) \"Maya\" scrap of paper (subsequent times; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices) Phoenix: ! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday. (I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.) \"Maya\" scrap of paper (subsequent times; after clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices) Phoenix: !

I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.) \"The Thinker\" statue Phoenix: It's encrusted with dried blood. How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again. Window Phoenix: There's a large building right across from the office. The \"Gatewater Hotel.\" A nice, luxurious place. Bookshelf Phoenix: All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings. Computer Phoenix: Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing. Desk Phoenix: A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office d√©cor: \"Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple.\" Ledger book Phoenix: The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money. Corded phone Phoenix: Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart. ???: Police!? Please, come quick! Phoenix: (Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand... Corded phone (subsequent times) Phoenix: The phone receiver is missing a few screws. I'd better not use it. Fey & Co. Law Offices If Fey & Co. Law Offices is being visited for the first time, before Receipt is added to the Court Record Phoenix: ...! (That girl just now... where'd she go!? I put her right there on that sofa...! Uh oh... I hope she didn't run on me.) Yipes! (Don't scare me like that...) Umm... Excuse me but, who are you? ???: ... Phoenix: It's okay. I work here. Maya: Maya... Maya Fey. Phoenix: Maya... Fey? If Fey & Co. Law Offices is being visited for the first time, after Receipt is added to the Court Record Phoenix: ...! (That girl just now... where'd she go!? I put her right there on that sofa...! Uh oh... I hope she didn't run on me.) Yipes! (Don't scare me like that...) Umm... Excuse me but, who are you? ???: ... Phoenix: It's okay. I work here. Maya: Maya... Maya Fey. Phoenix: Maya... Fey? (\"Maya\"...? So Mia was writing this girl's name! Maybe I should show her the receipt? I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom!) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant. Door Phoenix: The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob. Painting Phoenix: A large painting. I guess you'd call this \"modern art.\" I, on the other hand, call it a mistake. Reception desk Phoenix: The reception desk. I usually sit here. Sofa Phoenix: This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model. Writing desk Phoenix: A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies. Talk What happened Phoenix: (She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened? Maya: ... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...! Phoenix: (So she was already dead.) You and the Chief Phoenix: So, you're the chief's...? Maya: Sister. I'm her younger sister. Phoenix: And you were here... visiting? This late at night? Maya: Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her. Phoenix: Evidence...? Maya: Yes... I-it was that clock... It was \"The Thinker.\" Present The Thinker Phoenix: Um, about \"The Thinker\"... Maya: ! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob* Phoenix: (Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...) Glass Shards Phoenix: This was lying next to the chief. Maya: I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand. Phoenix: Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...) Receipt (before examining corded phone in Office) Phoenix: Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt. Maya: ! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name? Phoenix: Please, just calm down. Maya: W-why would Sis write my name? Phoenix: (Uh-oh. Now I've done it... I'd better hurry up and call the police!) Receipt (after examining corded phone in Office) Phoenix: Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt. Maya: ! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name? Phoenix: Please, just calm down. Maya: W-why would Sis write my name? Phoenix: (Uh-oh. Now I've done it...) Anything else Maya: I'm sorry, I've never seen that before. After examining corded phone in Office and presenting Receipt in Fey & Co. Law Offices: *whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*... *whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*... Phoenix: ! The police! (Sounds like they're coming this way!) Freeze! Police! Gumshoe: Alright, I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, see? Phoenix: (Gumshoe...? What an odd name.) Gumshoe: We received a report from the building across the way, see. Got a person saying they saw a murder. Phoenix: (It must have been that woman I saw.) Gumshoe: Anyway, I don't want either of you moving one inch, 'kay? Phoenix: (Great. Just great. Maya... Wait, she wouldn't have... nah.) Gumshoe: Whoaaaaaaaaaaaah! Scuze me! Maya: Eek! Gumshoe: This word \"Maya\" here mean anything to you? Maya: ...! Um... that... That's my name... Gumshoe: WHAAAAT!? The victim drew this here note in her own blood, see? With her dying breath, she wrote down the killer's name! Maya: K-killer...? I'm not-- Gumshoe: Case closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am. Maya: W-what? Phoenix: Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible. September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.) Maya: Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning. Phoenix: Good morning! (She looks so tired...) Maya: Um... Are you going to be my attorney? Phoenix: Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about... It's up to you Phoenix: (I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you. Maya: Up... to me? Phoenix: Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here. Maya: ... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it! Leads to: \"Did I look at her like that?\" Of course I will Phoenix: (First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up! Maya: R-really...? Phoenix: (Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it? Maya: ... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it! Leads to: \"Did I look at her like that?\" Sorry, not a chance Phoenix: (Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding... Maya: ... ... ... Phoenix: (Eh heh. Whoops. That didn't go so well.) Maya: ...Heh... Phoenix: Huh? M-Maya...? Was that a... chuckle? Maya: What? N-no! ... It wasn't very believable, was it? Phoenix: (Not really...) Maya: I-I'm sorry! I just thought, since you'd made a joke... Please, don't mind me! You're doing just fine! Phoenix: (Who's trying to cheer up who here!?) Maya: ... I knew it. No one will believe me. Phoenix: What? Maya: Even you-- when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it! Leads to: \"Did I look at her like that?\" Phoenix: (Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought... Maya: I-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you. Phoenix: Heard...? Heard what about me? Maya: I... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day... Mia: \"Today was my junior partner's first time in court.\" Maya: Wow! Really? How'd that go? Mia: \"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while...\" Maya: Hah! So, he crashed and burned? Mia: \"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience.\" Maya: Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now! Mia: \"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty.\" Maya: That's what she said! Phoenix: ... Maya: I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you... Phoenix: No, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia... Maya: ... I know... Examine Security camera Phoenix: Smile for the camera... Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Talk Maya Phoenix: There's something I've been wanting to ask you... Maya: Yes? Phoenix: What's with that outfit? Maya: Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say. Phoenix: A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do? Maya: Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training. Phoenix: A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.) The day of the crime Phoenix: Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Maya: Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial. Phoenix: Evidence? Maya: Yes. That clock shaped like \"The Thinker.\" Phoenix: (The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case? Maya: Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice? Phoenix: H-her own voice!? Maya: Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone. Phoenix: You recorded it! Maya: Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things. The day of the crime (after clearing \"Your cell phone\" Talk option) Phoenix: Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard. Maya: No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial. Phoenix: (That's \"The Thinker\" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office? Maya: It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister... Phoenix: Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now. Your cell phone (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it! Maya: Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry. Phoenix: Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it. Maya: I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay? Phoenix: Sure, thanks. Maya's Memo added to the Court Record. Your cell phone (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it! Maya: Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry. Phoenix: Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it. Maya: I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay? Phoenix: Sure, thanks. Spirit mediums (appears after \"Maya\") Phoenix: So you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training. Maya: That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world. Phoenix: Wait a second, you said the \"Fey Family\"? So, Mia was into this stuff too? Maya: Of course! She left the mountain to \"follow her career,\" she said. Her powers were first-class, too! Phoenix: (I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...! Maya: What? Phoenix: So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that? Maya: Yes. ...In training. Phoenix: Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her! Maya: ...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level... Phoenix: (Hmm... I thought that would be too easy.) Present The Thinker Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about the murder weapon... Maya: Poor Sis... *sniff* Phoenix: (Hmm. Better not ask her about this now.) Glass Shards Phoenix: This was lying next to the chief's body... Maya: I saw that too. They said they thought these were pieces of a broken light stand. Phoenix: Yeah, that seems about right. (Though I'd never heard of a glass light stand before this...) Receipt Phoenix: Remember that receipt? Maya: Y-you mean the one with my name on it? Phoenix: Any idea why she... Maya: Absolutely none! Um... Do you trust me? I trust you Phoenix: I trust you. Maya: Why? Don't you think I did it, too? Phoenix: No, I don't. (It's just a hunch, but...) Maya: That detective thinks I did it. Phoenix: ... Leads back to Court Record I don't trust you Phoenix: ... Maya: I didn't think you'd believe me. You're just like the detective. Phoenix: I'm sorry... I don't like lying just to make people feel better. But it doesn't mean that I've decided you did it! (She seemed so lost at the crime scene.) Leads back to Court Record Maya's Memo Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about your cell phone... Maya: That detective took it when they brought me in. Phoenix: (So, Gumshoe took it... I'll have to try to get it back next time I see him...) Anything else Maya: Sorry... I've never seen that before. After clearing all Talk options: Maya: ... Um...! Phoenix: Huh? Something the matter? Maya: Um... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor? Phoenix: ...? Maya: This is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me? Phoenix: (Hmm...) Accept Phoenix: Sure, why not? I'll go ask. Maya: Thank you so much! I have no one else to turn to... Phoenix: ...? Say, what about your parents...? Maya: ... ... ... Phoenix: I... I see. Don't worry, leave it to me. Maya: Thank you! The trial's tomorrow... at 10:00. Phoenix: W-what!? Tomorrow!? Maya: Tomorrow. Phoenix: What if this guy refuses!? Leads to: \"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\" Refuse Phoenix: I'm sorry... I think this is the kind of thing you should really do yourself. Maya: ...You're right. ... Phoenix: Something wrong? Maya: Actually, I asked the police to contact him, and they tried calling a few times. Nobody could get a hold of him! Phoenix: They couldn't find him? Maya: I have no one left to ask! Phoenix: ...? Say, what about your parents...? Maya: ... ... ... Phoenix: O-okay! Don't worry, I'll go ask him for you. Maya: Y-you will? Thank you so much! Phoenix: I'm just worried what will happen if I can't find him. Leads to: \"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\" Maya: They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me. Phoenix: When will that happen? Maya: They're giving me until 4:00 this afternoon. Phoenix: (And visiting hours are almost up... I'd better hurry!) Right, I'll be back! September 6Fey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: (The office is filled with police officers. They're all busily searching for clues...) ???: Hey! You there! This is a crime scene, pal! No trespassing! Umm... Sorry, don't I know you from somewhere? Wait, you're that Butz guy, aren't you! Phoenix: No, no, Phoenix Wright. (How could anyone mistake me for Larry!?) ???: Ah, guess I got the wrong name, Mr. Wright. Sorry 'bout that. That Butz guy, he was a killer! And you're no killer! Right? Phoenix: (He WAS proven innocent...) Umm... right. And you were... Detective Gumshoe Phoenix: Um... Gumshoe, wasn't it? Dick Gumshoe? ???: Right! At your service. Hang on! That's Detective Gumshoe to you, pal! Leads to: \"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\" Detective Suedeshoes Phoenix: Um... Suedeshoes, wasn't it? ???: That's me! Don't step on my blue suede shoes... Wait! That's a song, pal! My name's Dick Gumshoe... W-wait! That's Detective Gumshoe to you, pal! Leads to: \"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\" Detective Gumtree Phoenix: Um... Gumtree, was it? Detective Gumtree? ???: G-Gumtree...? Gum doesn't grow on trees, pal! And I'm the one in charge here so don't push your luck! Phoenix: (Whatever you say, Detective...) Leads to: \"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\" Gumshoe: Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"... Police: Hey, Dick! Get over here! Gumshoe: Y-yes, sir! B-be right there! Umm... ahem! You're her lawyer, right, pal? If you got business here, you'd better do it quick! Phoenix: (Whew! He thinks I'm Maya's lawyer...!) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is that Mia probably read all of these. Houseplant Phoenix: Mia's favorite potted plant. I remember it had this bizarre name no one could ever remember. ???: \"Cordyline stricta,\" pal! Phoenix: (Who was that!?) Mia's desk Phoenix: Mia's desk. Perfectly clean, as always. The only thing it's missing is... Mia. Movie poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it. I'll have to check it out one of these days. Window Phoenix: The sky is blue, and so am I... There's that hotel, right across the way. Talk Mia Phoenix: About Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy? Gumshoe: Hmm? You want to know the results, eh? Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: Now don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all! Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Mia (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, Mia's death was instantaneous. Gumshoe: That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person. Phoenix: You knew her, Detective? Gumshoe: Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all. Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win! Phoenix: W-why do you say that? Gumshoe: The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution! Phoenix: (Edgeworth...) Gumshoe: I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all. Edgeworth (appears after \"Maya\") Phoenix: Prosecutor Edgeworth... Gumshoe: That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!? Of course I do! Phoenix: I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his \"guilty\" verdict. Gumshoe: Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case. Phoenix: (So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...) Leads to: \"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\" Of course not! Phoenix: Never heard of him. Gumshoe: Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him! Phoenix: (Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a \"guilty\" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...) Leads to: \"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\" Phoenix: (All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...) Present The Thinker Phoenix: I was wondering, do you know anything about this? Gumshoe: That statue? That's the murder weapon. Phoenix: (Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.) Glass Shards Phoenix: There was broken glass at the crime scene, right? Gumshoe: Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand. Receipt Phoenix: There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there? Gumshoe: Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it! Phoenix: Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself? Gumshoe: Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not. Phoenix: (So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.) Maya's Memo Phoenix: I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone? Gumshoe: Oh that? I have that. Phoenix: Do you think you could give it back? Gumshoe: Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer! Phoenix: (Uh-oh, he's on to me!) Tell him straight Phoenix: (Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!) Gumshoe: Something the matter? Phoenix: Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective! Gumshoe: Nope. I know nothing, pal! Phoenix: That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets! Gumshoe: Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory! Phoenix: Impressive! You're quite the detective. Gumshoe: Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all. Leads to: \"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\" Tell him not-so-straight Phoenix: (Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?) Gumshoe: Something the matter? Phoenix: Oh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone... Gumshoe: This? Hmm... it says \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo\"... \"The Steel Samurai\"... that action hero on TV? Phoenix: Yeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct. Gumshoe: That what she said? Phoenix: Um. Yes. Gumshoe: ... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway. Here you go. Leads to: \"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\" Phoenix: (Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...) Maya's Cell Phone received from Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Received: Maya's Cell Phone.] in the original release) Check the Court Record to hear the recorded conversation. Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Thanks for this! Gumshoe: Don't mention it, pal. When it comes to dealing with lawyers, \"fight fair and square,\" is our motto! Phoenix: (I don't know how I feel, seeing everything written up like this... It makes Mia's death seem so... routine.) Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: (Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...) Anything else Gumshoe: Hmm? What's that? Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you! After clearing \"Mia\" and \"Maya\" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo: Phoenix: (I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.) Gumshoe: You all done, pal? Phoenix: Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now. Gumshoe: Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal! Phoenix: ... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness? Gumshoe: Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her! Phoenix: (Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then? Gumshoe: Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial! Phoenix: (So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information. Gumshoe: You got that right, pal! Phoenix: (Time to pay a visit to Miss May!) September 6Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: (According to the receptionist, the big boss is \"out\". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read. Desk Phoenix: A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster. Painting Phoenix: That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter. Potted plant Phoenix: An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available. Table Phoenix: A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn. Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303) Maya: Hey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer? Phoenix: Sorry. I haven't seen him yet. Maya: I see... Phoenix: (Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.) Talk Your family Phoenix: What about your family? Maya: I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is. Phoenix: (Don't know...? So she could still be alive?) Your mother (appears after \"Your family\") Maya: The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life. Phoenix: (\"Ruined\"...?) Maya: After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would \"become a lawyer\" and she left the mountain. Phoenix: ... So, you live by yourself? Maya: Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release) Phoenix: (I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...) Your mother's enemy (appears after \"Your mother\") Phoenix: So, who was this man who, um, \"ruined\" your mother? Maya: About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate... Phoenix: Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they? Maya: The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim. Phoenix: Wow... So, what happened? Maya: The case was solved... we thought. Phoenix: You \"thought\"...? Maya: The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent. Phoenix: ...! Maya: The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation. Phoenix: I see. Maya: ... White... Phoenix: Excuse me? White? Maya: That was his name. My sister told me. Phoenix: White? Hmm... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Hey, I got your cell phone back. Maya: Oh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice? Phoenix: ... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ... Maya: Thank you. September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303 April: Well! Hello there, handsome. Phoenix: Umm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.) April: You're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, \"Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!\" Tee hee! Phoenix: (Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.) April: Gee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness! Phoenix: (I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.) Examine Bed Phoenix: A simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here. Flowers Phoenix: The flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge. Open drawer Leads to: \"There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.\" Painting Phoenix: Ah. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be \"still life\"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall. Table Phoenix: A bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her. Window Phoenix: The late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though. Phoenix: (There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...) April: Hey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you? Phoenix: (Upset!? I thought she was going to explode for a second there! I wonder what could be inside the drawer?) Examine Open drawer Phoenix: (Hmm... what's inside I wonder?) April: *cough* *cough* Phoenix: (Maybe later...) Talk What you witnessed Phoenix: Do you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident. April: Ooh. \"Observe,\" \"incident\"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary. Phoenix: (Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please? April: Let me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer! Phoenix: (Oh boy.) Miss May Phoenix: Um, could you... just who exactly are you? April: Oooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me? Phoenix: N-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here! April: Tee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush. Phoenix: (Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do? April: Well... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you! Phoenix: (Oh boy.) This room Phoenix: I see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you? April: Oooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television! Phoenix: Oh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer! April: Say, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph! Phoenix: (Oh boy.) Present Anything April: Excuse me, but I'm a witness? Police witness? You understand? How could I possibly give you any information in good conscience, hmm? Me... \"the witness\"! It's just like the movie! Grossberg Law Offices (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303) Phoenix: (Hmm... seems like Mr. Grossberg is out. Well, maybe I should just wait here for him to come back.) ???: *Ah-HHHHEM!* Phoenix: (If that wasn't the most over-the-top clearing of the throat I've ever heard!) Grossberg: Ah hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me? Phoenix: Uh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!) Grossberg: Hmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now? Phoenix: Y-yes, well... yes. Grossberg: And what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed! Phoenix: (Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?) Grossberg: Hmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it! Phoenix: Um... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey. Grossberg: ...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on. Phoenix: (Hmm? Why the strange reaction?) Grossberg: A-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible. Phoenix: W-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!? Grossberg: Urk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion. Phoenix: (What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him! What do I tell Maya...?) Talk Your refusal Phoenix: How can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case! Grossberg: Hmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see! Phoenix: But the client is Mia Fey's sister! Grossberg: Hmm... ahem. Phoenix: Mia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands. Grossberg: Yes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye. Phoenix: Creep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere. Grossberg: *grumble*... Think not. Phoenix: Huh? Did you say something? Grossberg: I think not, I said. Phoenix: Wh-what do you mean? Grossberg: I'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy. Phoenix: Why!? Grossberg: I... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you. Phoenix: (What's going on here!?) Mia Phoenix: How did you know Mia Fey...? Grossberg: ... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see. Phoenix: A \"mission\"? Grossberg: You could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one. That painting Phoenix: That's... quite a painting. Grossberg: Ahah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you! Phoenix: (I wasn't interested...) Grossberg: It's not for sale! Phoenix: I'm not buying! (Geez!) Present Anything Grossberg: Very sorry, but I've got nothing to say regarding this matter. Fey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: ... (Looks like Detective Gumshoe has gone home. The police are still keeping themselves busy in the chief's office. No one has time to talk to me. Guess I'll head out.) Examine Houseplant Phoenix: Mia's favorite potted plant. I guess I'll have to water it now... Detention Center (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303, then visitng Grossberg Law Offices) Phoenix: Hmm... Maya's not here. She must be in questioning. They probably won't let her out for a while. Maybe I'd better go talk to that lawyer again. After clearing all Talk options in Grossberg Law Offices: September 6, 3:42 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Hiya. Maya: Oh! You're back! Did you find the lawyer? Phoenix: Um... well... (What do I tell her?) Well, see... (Just be honest!) I... I really don't think you should use that guy. He... didn't seem healthy. He was all skin and bones! Maya: ... What really happened? Phoenix: ... Maya: You don't mean... He refused to help? Phoenix: Urp. Maya: ... I see. I've been abandoned, then. After clearing \"Your mother's enemy\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, if all Talk options have been cleared in Grossberg Law Offices Leads to: \"Just a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess...\" Maya: Just a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess... Phoenix: ... (4:00 PM. Time's up. What should I do? Do I just leave her and go home...?) Go home Phoenix: (There's nothing left here for me to do... She'll be better off with a state-appointed lawyer.) I think I'd better get home now. Maya: Good-bye. Phoenix: It was a few days later when I found out how the story ended. The result of the trial was in the newspaper. \"Guilty.\" I'll probably never meet her again. Did I make the right choice? Will I ever know? Mia... if you can hear me, please, tell me! ... Phoenix: Not! I can't let that happen! I'm not leaving here until she takes me as her lawyer! Leads to: \"I've made up my mind!\" Defend Maya Leads to: \"I've made up my mind!\" Phoenix: I've made up my mind! I'm going to defend you whether you want me to or not! Maya: ! Why? Phoenix: Why? Well... I can't abandon you Phoenix: ... (No one is as sad as a person without any friends. I know... I've been there. A long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) Maya... Leads to: \"I won't abandon you. You can count on me.\" Someone else is the culprit Phoenix: You aren't the culprit! Someone else is! Maya: H-how do you know? Phoenix: I, um, I have a hunch... (Given the evidence, it would be easy to assume that Maya was the killer. But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) Maya... Leads to: \"I won't abandon you. You can count on me.\" I don't know why Phoenix: To be honest, I don't know. Maya: You don't know? Phoenix: (Is this girl sitting in front of me the killer? All the evidence seems to say \"yes.\" But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) There's only one thing I know for certain. Leads to: \"I won't abandon you. You can count on me.\" Phoenix: I won't abandon you. You can count on me. Maya: ... That's so kind of you... *sniff*... ... Phoenix: Well! Let's fight this one and get you out of here! Maya: R-right! Thank you! Phoenix: (Whew, she smiled at last. She looks like an entirely different person!) One last question... You are innocent, right? Maya: Yes! And I trust you... So you trust me, too, okay? Phoenix: It's a deal. (So, what next... There's something that's been bugging me... Just what was inside that strange woman's drawer? It was when I tried to look into the drawer that she got all defensive. There has to be something in there!) Gatewater Hotel Bellboy: Good afternoon, sir! Phoenix: Excuse me, you are...? Bellboy: Ah, I beg your pardon, sir! I am the bellboy of this establishment, at your service, sir. Phoenix: Oh, right. Bellboy: I've just come up to deliver room service, sir. Phoenix: Um... do you know where Miss May might be? Bellboy: Ah. I believe our guest Miss May is currently using the, er, facilities...? If you've no need of anything, I'll be taking my leave. Please, stay as long as you like. Enjoy... Phoenix: Yeah... Wait... no! Hey! ... (Why does it seem like every time I come here, I end up embarrassing myself? Wait... now's my chance to snoop around a bit!) Bellboy: Ah, I almost forgot! Phoenix: Gah! Y-you came back quick! Bellboy: Might I ask you to inform Miss May that there is a message for her? Please tell her that Mr. White, of Bluecorp phoned. Phoenix: Oh, right. Sure. (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? Where have I heard that name?) Maya: White... That was his name. My sister told me. Phoenix: (\"White\" was the name of the guy who ruined Mia and Maya's mother! Could it be a coincidence?) Examine Open drawer Leads to: \"There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer.\" Phoenix: There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer. Now's my chance to see what's inside! ...! What do we have here! A... wiretap? Hmm! What would a woman like her be doing with a thing like this? Wiretap added to the Court Record. Phoenix: There is definitely something suspicious about this \"Miss May\"! Why would she have something like this in her hotel room? There's a story behind all this, I know it! Alright... I'll be using this bit of evidence in tomorrow's trial, that's for sure. For Maya's sake... I'll get to this woman's bottom! Wait... I mean ... you know what I mean. April: Oh, bellboy...? Still there? Phoenix: (Uh oh, time to scram! I look forward to tangoing with you tomorrow, Miss May! In court!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Turnabout Sisters Transcript Transcript (JP) Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 September 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1 Judge: The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey. Edgeworth: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement. Edgeworth: Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor. Judge: I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then. Edgeworth: If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe! Edgeworth: Witness, please state your name and profession to the court. Gumshoe: Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder. Gumshoe: Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here. Edgeworth: And the cause of death? Gumshoe: Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of \"The Thinker\" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir! Judge: The court accepts the statue as evidence. Phoenix: (They're still calling it a \"statue\"...) Floor Plans added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Now, Detective... Gumshoe: Y-yes sir! Edgeworth: You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why? Gumshoe: Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir! Judge: Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this \"hard evidence.\" Witness Testimony -- Maya Fey's Arrest -- Gumshoe: As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene! There were two people there already: The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright. I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey! Why? We had a witness account describing her! The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder! Judge: Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination. Phoenix: Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...) ...whoosh...SMACK! Phoenix: (Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!\" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!) Judge: Something the matter? Phoenix: No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Maya Fey's Arrest -- Gumshoe: As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who did you say you got a call from? Gumshoe: Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene! Phoenix: (Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue. Gumshoe: There were two people there already: Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime? Gumshoe: Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes! Phoenix: Th-that's pretty fast! Gumshoe: Our motto this month is \"quick response\"! That's how I got there before the killer got away! Edgeworth: Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were. Gumshoe: Yes sir! Gumshoe: The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely sure it was us? Gumshoe: Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene! Phoenix: (Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...) Gumshoe: I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why's that? What's your reason? Gumshoe: Why? We had a witness account describing her! Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold on just one second!\" Gumshoe: The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder! Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold on just one second!\" Phoenix: (I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!) Phoenix: Hold on just one second! Gumshoe: Y-yeah? Phoenix: If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had \"hard evidence\" she did it, correct? Gumshoe: Huh? Did... did I say that? Me? Phoenix: I heard you say it! Judge: You did say it. Edgeworth: You said it. Phoenix: Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was \"hard evidence\"!? Gumshoe: Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink... Judge: That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective? Gumshoe: Umm... Phoenix: (Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!) Gumshoe: ... Yes. Phoenix: (Gah!) Gumshoe: Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor! Judge: Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again. Witness Testimony -- Hard Evidence -- Gumshoe: After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes. I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body! On it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood! Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's! Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger! Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name! How you like that? That's my \"hard evidence\"! Judge: Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective. Gumshoe: Y-Your Honor? Judge: Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!? Gumshoe: Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir. Judge: Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Hard Evidence -- Gumshoe: After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And did you find any evidence? Gumshoe: Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part! Phoenix: (I got a bad feeling about this...) Gumshoe: I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it! Gumshoe: Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants? Phoenix: Wh-who? Um... The killer Phoenix: Th-the killer! Anyone can see that! Gumshoe: Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please! Phoenix: She was framed! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence? Phoenix: Ah... (Urk!) Edgeworth: Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright. Gumshoe: Yeah, pal! Phoenix: (Argh...!) Leads to: \"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\" Miss May Phoenix: Well... it could have been the witness, Miss May! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright! Gumshoe: Yeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal! Phoenix: (Argh...!) Leads to: \"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\" I did Phoenix: It... it could have been me! Gumshoe: What! S-so it was you! Phoenix: No, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note? Phoenix: Uh... Edgeworth: Listen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur! Phoenix: (...!) Leads to: \"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\" Edgeworth: Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found. Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: On it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!? Gumshoe: Of course I do, pal! Phoenix: (Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident. This might not be good...) Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What kind of \"tests\" were these again? Gumshoe: Huh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests! Judge: Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony. Gumshoe: Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir. Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Y-yeah? Edgeworth: I think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check. Gumshoe: Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Phoenix: (That was a mess...) Gumshoe: Right! Where was I? Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: On which hand was the bloody finger, Detective? Gumshoe: The right hand! Phoenix: (Hmm... she WAS right handed...) Gumshoe: Hah hah hah! Nice try! Phoenix: (Uh oh... I guess it wasn't too hard to see what I was getting at there.) Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Gumshoe: Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name? Gumshoe: Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies! Phoenix: This isn't a movie, Detective. Gumshoe: Oof! Phoenix: Let's talk about reality, shall we? Gumshoe: Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no. Phoenix: Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister? Gumshoe: Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer! Judge: Order! Order! Phoenix: (That didn't go so well...) Gumshoe: Th-that's right! What he said! Present Mia's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe!\" Phoenix: (That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!) Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying? Gumshoe: Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!? Phoenix: You have it backwards, Detective. Gumshoe: B-backwards? Phoenix: The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. \"Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object.\" She died immediately! Gumshoe: But...! Phoenix: No \"but\"-ing your way out of this one, Detective! Judge: Order! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report? Phoenix: Wh-when...!? The day of the murder Phoenix: I... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder. Gumshoe: You're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after! Phoenix: Oh. Right. Leads to: \"The prosecution's point being...?\" The day after the murder Phoenix: It was the day after the murder... Leads to: \"The prosecution's point being...?\" I forget Phoenix: I'm... sorry, I forgot. Edgeworth: Hah! Forgot, you say? Gumshoe: It was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally! Phoenix: Oh. R-right. Leads to: \"The prosecution's point being...?\" Judge: The prosecution's point being...? Edgeworth: That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor. Phoenix: Wh-what!? Edgeworth: A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! \"Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow.\" I received these results this morning. Phoenix: N-no way! Edgeworth: Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write \"Maya\"! That is all. Judge: I see! Phoenix: (Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!) Edgeworth: Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say? You're a sham, Edgeworth! Phoenix: Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report? Judge: Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution! Edgeworth: No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable. Leads to: \"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\" The detective's a sham! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!? Gumshoe: Huh? I-I thought... Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Urp! Edgeworth: I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that. Gumshoe: Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir. Edgeworth: You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month. Gumshoe: W-what? B-but... *sigh* Leads to: \"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\" I'm a sham! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe. Are you calling me a fool because I believed your report? Gumshoe: Huh? Me? I-I'm not... huh? Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Urp! Edgeworth: I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that. Gumshoe: Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir. Edgeworth: You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month. Gumshoe: W-what? B-but... *sigh* Leads to: \"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\" Edgeworth: Your Honor, I submit this report to the court. Judge: U-understood. The court accepts the evidence. Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record. Edgeworth: Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer. Judge: I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes. Phoenix: (Darn! This isn't good!) Edgeworth: The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes! Judge: Let the witness Miss April May take the stand. Phoenix: (Exactly what part of her is \"innocent\"...?) Edgeworth: Witness, your name, please. April: April May! At your service! *wink* Judge: Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking! ([wanton] misspelled as [wonton] in the original release) April: Aww... Yes, Your Honor. Phoenix: (This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!) Edgeworth: Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred? April: Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch. Edgeworth: And this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices? April: Mmm... that's right, big boy. Judge: Please testify to the court about what you saw. Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- April: It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know! And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked! The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair! Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away! But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her! Then the woman with long hair... She kinda... slumped. The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink* Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: Well, Your Honor? Judge: I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any... Phoenix: W-wait, Your Honor! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: What about my cross-examination!? Judge: I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you? Edgeworth: Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies... Phoenix: H-hey! How dare you! Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness? Yes, I'm doing it Phoenix: I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!) Leads to: \"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!\" No thanks Phoenix: No... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point. Edgeworth: Heh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case! Phoenix: (Wh-what? That's it!?) Judge: Very well. Phoenix: W-wait! Hold on! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness? Phoenix: Yes yes yes! (I'd better, or I'll lose on the spot!) Leads to: \"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!\" Judge: Very well, you may begin your cross-examination! Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- April: It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why did you do that? April: Huh? \"Why\"? Like, why what? Phoenix: Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something? April: Oh, well, um... gee! Phoenix: (What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!) April: I sort of, y'know. I had a feeling! Phoenix: (Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question! Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?) Go for it Phoenix: (Let's see how far I can run with this...) Surely, you must have had a reason to look out your window at that time of night! April: I... oooh! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness! Phoenix: B-badgering? Edgeworth: You insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed. (Yeah! Yeah! Stop him!) (The poor girl!) Judge: Order! Mr. Wright, you have been warned. Phoenix: (Poor girl!? What about poor me!?) Leads to: \"You looked out the window. What did you see next?\" Back down Phoenix: (If I go too deep, I might not come back out alive... I'll back off for now.) Leads to: \"You looked out the window. What did you see next?\" Edgeworth: You looked out the window. What did you see next? April: And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The woman with long hair... that was Mia Fey? April: Um-hmm! Slender, sort of, well, some people might say pretty, if that's your thing. Phoenix: (Your... thing?) Edgeworth: And the person attacking her? April: The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How do you know she was the defendant? April: Huh? Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay? Edgeworth: There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor. Phoenix: (He's right...) Yep, he's right Phoenix: (Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.) Edgeworth: So then, tell us what happened to the victim. Leads back to cross-examination I question the testimony Leads to: \"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!\" April: Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She \"dodged\"? Dodged what!? April: Well... the attack! Edgeworth: Please, continue your testimony. April: But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How did you know it was my client!? April: Huh? Well, I... gee! First of all, she had a girl's physique! And, and secondly, she was... she was small! Who else could it be but her! Phoenix: (She has a point...) You're right Phoenix: (Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one. Maybe I should just listen to the testimony again.) Leads back to cross-examination I question your testimony Leads to: \"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!\" Phoenix: (Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!) Phoenix: Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks! April: W-what!? Phoenix: Miss May, I'm willing to bet that... You saw nothing Phoenix: Did you really see the defendant at all!? Leads to: \"Urp!\" You're lying Phoenix: Are you telling the truth? Did you really see the defendant!? Leads to: \"Urp!\" April: Urp! Judge: Mr. Wright! What's the meaning of this? April: Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean! Phoenix: Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique! April: ...! Phoenix: No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus! April: But... but! Judge: Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder... Phoenix: She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May? April: Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling. Judge: Miss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony. April: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink* Judge: Your testimony again, if you would. Phoenix: (Damn, I almost had her!) Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- April: I did see everything! I did! The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right. Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her... And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did! That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think? Well? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee! Judge: I... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- April: I did see everything! I did! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you saw me then, too? April: Of course! I'd remember that spiky hair anywhere! Phoenix: (Spiky...?) Judge: The witness will refrain from personal attacks on the defense attorney. April: Aww, was I a bad girl? I'm sowwy. Judge: Very well... continue. April: The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is that \"right\" as in your right, as you looked from the hotel? April: Um... which hand do I hold my knife in again...? Right! It was my right hand! Right? Edgeworth: Satisfied, Mr. Wright? Please continue. April: Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How convenient for you to remember her \"hippie\" clothes! April: That's what you--I mean, that's what she was wearing! Oh, and her hair was all done up like a bun! Phoenix: (*sigh*...) Judge: What happened then? April: And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where did this weapon come from? April: She picked it up from the desk! Judge: I see. What sort of weapon was it? April: That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A... clock? (Didn't this come up in another testimony recently...?) April: W-well? Don't look so sour, Mr. Lawyer. You can't win them all. Phoenix: (No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!) Present The Thinker Phoenix: Leads to: \"Miss May.\" Phoenix: (Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.) Phoenix: Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing. April: Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer... Phoenix: You just said that this statue of \"The Thinker\" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it! April: Urp! Phoenix: Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a \"clock,\" too... And he was found guilty... of murder! Judge: Order! Order! Phoenix: Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock? April: Oooh... urp! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns! Judge: Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Phoenix: But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...) Judge: ... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness. Phoenix: (Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!) April: Huh? What? So... what happens now? Phoenix: What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock? April: What...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time! Phoenix: So, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.! April: N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee! Edgeworth: The law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock! Judge: Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied? Phoenix: No, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because... She couldn't have heard it Phoenix: You were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You have proof that she could not? Phoenix: Uh... Edgeworth: Amateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing. Phoenix: Then I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard... Edgeworth: The prosecution denies your request! Phoenix: Wh-what!? On what grounds? Edgeworth: This is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand! Judge: Indeed. Objection sustained. Phoenix: (Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!) Judge: Ready to proceed, Mr. Wright? Leads back to: \"No, Your Honor!\" It couldn't have rung Leads to: \"Your Honor, members of the court...\" Phoenix: Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang! It's empty Phoenix: That clock is missing its clockwork! Judge: H-how could you possibly...? Phoenix: Just have a look... Right now! (Changed from [Just have a look... As soon as you can!] in the original release) Judge: ... Oh! Phoenix: See anything interesting, Your Honor? Judge: It is as the defense says! Leads to: \"This clock is missing its clockwork!\" It's broken Phoenix: I-I think it's broken! That clock's busted! Judge: You \"think\"? Phoenix: J-just look at it! Your Honor, please examine the clock! Judge: Hmm... Oh! Phoenix: See anything interesting, Your Honor? Judge: Well, I'm not sure I would call this \"broken,\" but I doubt it could ring...! Leads to: \"This clock is missing its clockwork!\" The batteries are dead Phoenix: The batteries on that clock must be dead! Judge: \"Must be,\" Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Your Honor, if you would inspect the clock...! Judge: Hmm... very well. ... Oh! Phoenix: Well, Your Honor? Are they...? Judge: This clock has graver problems than dead batteries! Leads to: \"This clock is missing its clockwork!\" Judge: This clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this? Phoenix: It is as you can see. The \"clock\" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar! April: F-fat!? Phoenix: Well, Miss May? Edgeworth: Tsk tsk. Phoenix: ? Edgeworth: Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!) Edgeworth: I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction! Judge: ! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it. Edgeworth: And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor! Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed? Edgeworth: Ho hoh! Impossible, of course... Phoenix: I have proof. Edgeworth: W-what!? Phoenix: Wasn't it you who told me \"proof is everything\"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the \"proof\" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Leads to: \"Take a look at this!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: What do you say to that? April: W-what? I don't rightly understand what that's supposed to mean! Judge: I don't rightly understand either. Edgeworth: Ho hoh! Phoenix: (Uh oh... I think I blew it.) Judge: Mr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future. Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor! Leads back to: \"The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...\" Phoenix: Take a look at this! Judge: Hmm. That's a very cute cell phone. April: Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone! Phoenix: W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder! Judge: Order! Order! Edgeworth: The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention! Phoenix: Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it? Edgeworth: *grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...) Phoenix: (I gotta say, I'm starting to feel bad for the big fella.) (Changed from [My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.] in the original release) Let's hear the conversation. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [So you just want me to hold on to \"The Thinker\" for you, then?] Mia: [If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.] Maya: [Huh? It's not working? That's lame!] Mia: [I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.] ...[September 5, 9:27 AM] Cellular: *beep* Phoenix: Your Honor, I think this makes it clear the clockwork was already gone by the time this was recorded, (Changed from [I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone...] in the original release) which was well before the witness even arrived at her hotel! (Changed from [and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!] in the original release) April: Muh... muh... muh!? Phoenix: Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!? April: ... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink* Judge: So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright? Yes Leads to: \"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\" No Phoenix: Oh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!) Judge: Then, the court would like-- Phoenix: Hold on! P-please wait, Your Honor! Judge: Y-yes...? So you do have an objection? Phoenix: Um, yes, well... Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Sorry, Your Honor, it's just... Leads to: \"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\" Phoenix: The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\" But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court! Judge: Well then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before. Present The Thinker Phoenix: Leads to: \"It's simple.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here is undeniable proof! Edgeworth: Hah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece! Judge: Hmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind? Leads back to: \"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.\" Phoenix: It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever! April: W-whaaat!? Phoenix: A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody! April: I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores! Phoenix: Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...? April: Mmpf... Phoenix: Oh? Excuses not on sale today? April: Oooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die! Judge: W-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm! April: Hrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink* Phoenix: (S-scary...) Judge: Miss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock? April: ... Judge: Hmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior? Phoenix: (Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because... You held it Phoenix: (This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands! Judge: Mr. Wright! When was this!? Phoenix: When she used it to strike the victim! When else? Judge: Order! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!? Phoenix: April May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made \"The Thinker\" ring! That's when you heard it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: W-what's that supposed to mean!? Edgeworth: It was you who just proved that \"The Thinker\" was empty! Phoenix: Oh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!) Edgeworth: What's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder. Phoenix: (S-she can't prove it! She did it!) April: It would be MY pleasure! Phoenix: N-no way! April: Yes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy! Edgeworth: Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid! Judge: Mr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman! Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know \"The Thinker\" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof! Judge: Well... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock? Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Phoenix: The defendant's cell phone. Judge: Yes, we've seen that already. Phoenix: Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.] Mia: [Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.] Maya: [Again? What's it this time?] Mia: [It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!] ... Judge: They do mention \"The Thinker.\" But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation? Present Wiretap Phoenix: Leads to: \"Have a look at this.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!) Judge: Mr. Wright! Your evidence, please! Leads back to: \"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\" Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!? April: I... I... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is ridiculous! Phoenix: Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer. April: La... laaa... lrrrrgf! Judge: Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone? April: ... Judge: Miss May! April: Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER! ...... April: I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!) You did it, didn't you? Phoenix: Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you? April: Are you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Why the wiretap? Phoenix: Miss May... Why did you tap her phone? April: ... Phoenix: Answer the question! April: Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant? Phoenix: (Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that \"irrelevant\"! Judge: While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone? April: At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Present Wiretap Phoenix: Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not? April: Oooh. Oooooh! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is irrelevant! Judge: I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap. Edgeworth: This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone? Phoenix: Absolutely! Edgeworth: Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT! Phoenix: Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple! Edgeworth: WHAAAAT!? Phoenix: Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Leads to: \"I present the defendant's cell phone.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This! I think... Judge: That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think... Phoenix: W-wait! That was just a warm up! Judge: Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time! Leads back to: \"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\" Phoenix: I present the defendant's cell phone. Judge: Yes, we've seen that. Phoenix: Listen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.] Mia: [Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.] Maya: [Again? What's it this time?] Mia: [It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!] ... Phoenix: Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!? April: I... I... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is ridiculous! Phoenix: Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer. April: La... laaa... lrrrrgf! Judge: Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone? April: ... Judge: Miss May! April: Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER! ...... April: I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!) You did it, didn't you? Phoenix: Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you? April: Are you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Why the wiretap? Phoenix: Miss May... Why did you tap her phone? April: ... Phoenix: Answer the question! April: Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant? Phoenix: (Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that \"irrelevant\"! Judge: While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone? April: At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy! Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence reveals the truth of the matter! Judge: What does it reveal, exactly? Edgeworth: The mad delusions of the defense, perhaps? Phoenix: (Uh oh, bad reaction. Maybe that wasn't the thing...) Judge: I'm afraid it has revealed a certain over-eagerness... Let me ask again: Leads back to: \"How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock?\" You had heard about it Phoenix: The witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock! Judge: She \"heard\"...? Phoenix: That is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known \"The Thinker\" was a clock! And I can show you the proof! Judge: Well, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had \"heard\" the murder weapon was a clock. Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Phoenix: The defendant's cell phone. Judge: Yes, we've seen that already. Phoenix: Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.] Mia: [Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.] Maya: [Again? What's it this time?] Mia: [It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!] ... Judge: They do mention \"The Thinker.\" But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation? Present Wiretap Phoenix: Leads to: \"Have a look at this.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!) Judge: Mr. Wright! Your evidence, please! Leads back to: \"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\" Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!? April: I... I... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is ridiculous! Phoenix: Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer. April: La... laaa... lrrrrgf! Judge: Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone? April: ... Judge: Miss May!

Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah! Phoenix: (That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!) You did it, didn't you? Phoenix: Miss May! April: What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!? Phoenix: You killed her, didn't you! Judge: Order! There will be order! April: What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops! Phoenix: So you admit you tapped her phone! April: Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl! Phoenix: Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!) April: You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will! Phoenix: You can't be serious! No way! April: Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy... Phoenix: R-room service!? April: Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee. Phoenix: I-ice coffee...!? April: Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink* Edgeworth: Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder! Phoenix: ! Judge: So, where does that leave us...? Edgeworth: It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder! Phoenix: (No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...) Leads to: \"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\" Why the wiretap? Phoenix: Why did you tap her phone? April: ... Phoenix: Answer the question! April: Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant? Phoenix: (Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.)

Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone? Phoenix: (Hah! I'd like to see her pull THAT off!) April: Mr. Lawyer, I saw that evil, evil grin! You were probably thinking \"I'd like to see her pull THAT off,\" weren't you! Phoenix: (Damn... she's good!) April: Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will! Phoenix: You can't be serious! No way! April: Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night?

April: Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh... Phoenix: I found this in Miss May's room. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is! Phoenix: Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not? April: Oooh. Oooooh! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, this is irrelevant! Judge: I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap. Edgeworth: This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone? Phoenix: Absolutely! Edgeworth: Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT! Phoenix: Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple! Edgeworth: WHAAAAT!? Phoenix: Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is... Present Maya's Cell Phone Phoenix: Leads to: \"I present the defendant's cell phone.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This! I think... Judge: That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think... Phoenix: W-wait! That was just a warm up! Judge: Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time! Leads back to: \"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\" Phoenix: I present the defendant's cell phone. Judge: Yes, we've seen that. Phoenix: Listen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim. Cellular: *beep* ... Maya: [Mia! What's up?

Judge: I'm afraid I'm not sure where you are going with all of this, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Um... \"where\"? Well, it's not so much a place as a... er... Edgeworth: Come to the end of your bluff, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: W-wait! Wait! That was, uh, practice! Here's the real evidence! Judge: Mr. Wright, this court does not condone the presentation of evidence for \"practice.\" Let's see your evidence, for real this time, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"Show me evidence proving that the witness had \"heard\" the murder weapon was a clock.\" Judge: Well, does the defense have anything to say? Phoenix: Um, well... (Come on, think of something!) Call the bellboy as a witness Phoenix: The defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it! April: I think you've sunken quite low enough already. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I object to calling the bellboy! Phoenix: W-why? What's your reason? Edgeworth: Because I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing! Phoenix: ...! Edgeworth: However... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness. Phoenix: Condition...? Edgeworth: If Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of \"guilty\" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition. Phoenix: (What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared \"guilty\" on the spot! What should I do...?) Accept the condition Phoenix: (Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition. Edgeworth: Hmph. Fool... You fell right into my trap! Phoenix: (Uh oh!) Uh... um, wait... Leads to: \"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\" Give up Phoenix: (Grr! I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness. Judge: I see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Right. On with the cross-examination. Edgeworth: What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection! Phoenix: (Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!) Judge: Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call? Edgeworth: None, Your Honor. She's the last. Phoenix: (What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The defense would like to call the bellboy after all! Edgeworth: ... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought! Phoenix: ...? Edgeworth: May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced \"guilty\"! Are you prepared to accept my condition? Phoenix: (Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept! Leads to: \"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\" Continue examining Miss May Phoenix: Right. On with the cross-examination. Edgeworth: What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection! Phoenix: (Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!) Judge: Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call? Edgeworth: None, Your Honor. She's the last. Phoenix: (What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor! Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The defense would like to call the bellboy after all! Edgeworth: ... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought! Phoenix: ...? Edgeworth: May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced \"guilty\"! Are you prepared to accept my condition? Phoenix: (Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept! Leads to: \"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\" Judge: Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand! Edgeworth: I believe we're ready for the witness to testify. He certainly does look like a bellboy. Bellboy: Yes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service. Judge: That tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado, the witness may begin his testimony. Bellboy: Very good, sir! Witness Testimony -- Miss May's Room Service -- Bellboy: I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations! I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May. She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir. I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course. And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself. Judge: I see. The defense may begin its cross-examination. Phoenix: R-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!) Cross Examination -- Miss May's Room Service -- Bellboy: I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What exactly is it you do at the hotel? Bellboy: Why, anything required of me, sir. I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally. Phoenix: Are you always so... so prim? Judge: Mr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions... Bellboy: I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure it was Miss May on the phone? Bellboy: Absolutely, sir. Phoenix: H-how can you be so certain!? Bellboy: I checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir. Judge: Yes, what then? Bellboy: She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: 9:00 \"on the dot,\" you say? Bellboy: Yes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir. Phoenix: (9:00... the time of the murder!) Bellboy: I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Precisely\" 9:00, then? Bellboy: Precisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM. Phoenix: How can you be so sure!? Bellboy: Miss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. \"Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!\" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir. Phoenix: (Why would she be so particular about the time?) Bellboy: And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You are sure it was Miss April May herself? Bellboy: Ab-SO-lutely, sir. Phoenix: \"Ab-SO-lutely\"...? Bellboy: Yes, sir. As in, \"so very absolutely,\" sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine. Phoenix: How come you're so very certain!? Bellboy: Well, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an \"embrasser,\" sir. Phoenix: \"Embrasser\"!? Is that French for \"embrace\"? Bellboy: It's French for \"kiss,\" sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek. Phoenix: Wh-why would she have done that...? Bellboy: I believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir. Phoenix: (Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!) Phoenix: (This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!) After pressing fourth and fifth statements: Phoenix: ... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?) Edgeworth: Tsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here! Judge: Hmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand. Phoenix: (I can't let this happen... can I?) Protest Leads to: \"W-wait! Please wait!\" Give up Phoenix: (No...! If I give up now, I lose everything... If I just give up the case, I'd be giving up the very reason I became a lawyer!) Leads to: \"W-wait! Please wait!\" Phoenix: W-wait! Please wait! Judge: Yes? Does the defense have something to add? Phoenix: One last question... let me ask one last question! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough! Judge: Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all. Phoenix: (Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?) Check-in Phoenix: T-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May. Bellboy: Oh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really. Phoenix: I see...¬†? Excuse me... what exactly was a \"disappointment\"? Bellboy: Well, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there. Phoenix: (...! What did he say!?) What did you say!? Bellboy: Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite! Phoenix: Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person? Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I object! That was... objectionable!\" Room service Phoenix: T-tell me again about er... room service! Bellboy: A-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall. Phoenix: I see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive? Bellboy: Y-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir. Phoenix: (...! What did he say!?) What did you say!? Bellboy: Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite! Phoenix: Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room? Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I object! That was... objectionable!\" Bed making Phoenix: Bed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day. Edgeworth: I was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low! Judge: Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question. Bellboy: Yes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see. Phoenix: I see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say? Bellboy: Eh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir? Phoenix: Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room? Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I object! That was... objectionable!\" Edgeworth: I object! That was... objectionable! Judge: ... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question. Bellboy: Er... yes, I see. Phoenix: Why did you not mention this in your testimony!? Bellboy: W-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask! Phoenix: (Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention! Bellboy: Ah, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who... Phoenix: ! Bellboy: He asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir. Edgeworth: Oof! Y-you fool! Phoenix: I've done it... I've won! Phoenix: Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct? Bellboy: Yes, sir. Phoenix: Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...? Bellboy: That's right, sir. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: And who, Mr. Wright! Who is this \"other person\"! (Changed from [Who! Who is this 'other person'!] in the original release) Phoenix: Simple, it was... Miss April May Phoenix: None other than Miss April May! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Eh!? Have you heard nothing that has transpired so far!? She has an alibi! She was in the hotel at the time of the murder! Phoenix: Oh... right. Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance! Leads back to: \"Simple, it was...\" The man with Miss May Leads to: \"The man who checked in with Miss May!\" The Bellboy Phoenix: It was the bellboy and none other! Judge: Well, this comes as some surprise... Edgeworth: Your Honor, Mr. Wright... It was the bellboy who confirmed Miss May's alibi... And this in turn confirms the bellboy's alibi! He was in the hotel! Phoenix: Well, s-sure... if you put it that way... Edgeworth: I do put it that way, and I trust you will too! Phoenix: But what if they were in cahoots! Judge: You have evidence of this? Phoenix: Um... no, Your Honor. Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance! Leads back to: \"Simple, it was...\" Phoenix: The man who checked in with Miss May! Edgeworth: Oof! Phoenix: Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!! Edgeworth: M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late... Phoenix: \"Too late\"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court! Edgeworth: Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous! Judge: Enough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood? Edgeworth: Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor. Judge: That is all today for the trial of Maya Fey. Court is adjourned! September 7, 2:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Maya: Mr. Wright! You were amazing in there! Phoenix: R-really? Maya: I think I might be your newest fan! Phoenix: Oh, I was just \"doing my job\" you know... heh heh. Maya: Then again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too... Phoenix: Huh? Maya: That face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine! Phoenix: Hmm... if you say so. Maya: So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now? Phoenix: Um, well... (Changed from [Well, no.] in the original release) No, I don't think so. Not yet. (Changed from [I don't think so. Not yet.] in the original release) Maya: Oh... I see. Phoenix: But I got a great lead in today's trial! Maya: A \"lead\"? Phoenix: That man with Miss May! He's the key! Maya: Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway? Phoenix: I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed. Maya: Yes sir! Phoenix: I'm going to find out more about this man. Maya: Do you think he was the one who...? Phoenix: Maybe so. Maya: Sis... Phoenix: Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise. Maya: I'm counting on you! Phoenix: I asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that hasn't been stricken from the record. (Changed from [In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.] in the original release) May Testimony added to the Court Record. Phoenix: I don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to set her free! (Changed from [Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to get her free!] in the original release) To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory. Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow? Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Maya Fey... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Turnabout Sisters Transcript Transcript (JP) Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 September 7, 3:11 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room April: Well hello! I didn't expect anyone to visit me in such a dank place as this... It's really quite... moving. Not! You stinking lawyer! I hope you die! Have you come to laugh? Yes, laugh at the fallen Miss May! Phoenix: No, not really, there's something I wanted to ask. April: Unfortunately, there is nothing I want to BE asked. Haven't you done enough questioning, you...! Spiky-head! Phoenix: (Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the security guard. April: ... So? What is it you wish to ask of me, then? Hmm? Phoenix: (For starters, how did you get to be so totally whacked!?) Examine Security camera Phoenix: Smile for the camera... Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Or maybe he just doesn't get to see a lot of women like Miss May in here. Talk That \"man\" Phoenix: About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... April: ... Phoenix: Can you tell me about him? Where is he? C'mon... April: No way, Jose. Phoenix: (Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...) The wiretap Phoenix: Why did you place a wiretap on Mia's phone? April: Aww, when you say it like that it sounds so... cold. So criminal! Phoenix: Um... tapping people's phones is a crime, Miss May. April: Oh, and I suppose you learned that in Lawyer School, hmm? Creep! Phoenix: (This woman is impossible to talk to...) Your attitude Phoenix: Say... Why are you so... angry? I mean, you don't look like a bad person... April: Ooh, that does it! Bottom-feeding, scum-sucking lawyer! Phoenix: B-bottom...? (I can't tell, does she have a thing against lawyers... or just against me?) Present Anything April: Hey, guess what. Actually, I, um, really hate your guts. So get lost. Because, well, I'm not cooperating. Phoenix: (Thanks, I noticed.) September 7Fey & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Looks like forensics is taking the day off today. Detective Gumshoe's nowhere in sight. The police really gave this place a working over. I doubt there are any valuable clues left. Suppose it can't hurt to take a look around, though. Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. All the cases that the chief worked on are filed here. Hmm. Are some of the files missing...? Nah, I'm imagining things. September 7Grossberg Law Offices Phoenix: (Huh. Looks like Grossberg is out today... again. Maybe he's avoiding me for some reason?) Examine Photos on desk Phoenix: What's this? Old photos? There are two lying here. Something's been written in pencil on the backs. \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A,\" \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B\"... Let's take a look at these... \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A\" Phoenix: ... I'm sure I've seen this person somewhere... Perhaps I'll borrow this photo. I'm sure no one will miss just one little photo. And it might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. Photograph quietly added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination \"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B\" Phoenix: Why would Grossberg have a picture of this man...? This might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. I'm just borrowing it. I'll return it later. Photograph quietly added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination Leave them alone Phoenix: I don't need it now, whatever it is. If I ever run out of clues, I'll know where to find these. (Although I can't be sure the photos will still be here then...) Leads back to examination Photos on desk (after one has been added to the Court Record) Phoenix: A photo lies on the desk. Maybe I should switch it with the one I took? Swap photos Phoenix: I think I'll swap them... Photograph added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination Leave it alone Phoenix: No, on second thought, I'd better not. Leads back to examination Vacant wall Phoenix: Wait a second... Wasn't there a giant painting hanging on that wall...? Yeah... yeah, it was a painting of... Sunflowers Leads to: \"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.\" Marvin Grossberg Leads to: \"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.\" Fishermen Leads to: \"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.\" Phoenix: Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow. Detention Center (after visiting Grossberg Law Offices) April: YOU AGAIN!? Can't you take a hint and stay gone? Phoenix: Hey, the only reason I'm back here is because YOU won't talk to me! April: Oh, so it's MY fault now? You don't just have spiky hair, you also have a spiky heart. Phoenix: (That does it. When this case is done I'm shaving my head.) Talk That \"man\" Phoenix: About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... Can you tell me about him? Where is he? April: I'm not telling! Phoenix: Look, he's being accused of murder! I don't think you want to be protecting him. April: Hmm. Would you have sold out the late Ms. Fey to the cops? Phoenix: No. April: See? Phoenix: (Damn! Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...) Present Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A) Phoenix: Any thoughts about this photograph? April: ... Who's that? Your mother? Phoenix: (... *sigh* Looks like I've just been wasting my time.) Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) Phoenix: Have a look at this. April: Look, I've said several times, I'm not telling you...¬†! Where did you...? Phoenix: (Ah hah! A reaction!) This is him, isn't it? April: What? Who? When? Why...? Phoenix: It IS him. This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder! April: No! No, that's not right. Phoenix: (Nice try, Miss Cooperative.) April: D-do you have proof that was him? Hmm? Y-yeah! Proof! Show me proof! Phoenix: (I'm so close!) September 7Gatewater HotelRoom 303 Bellboy: Ah, welcome, sir! Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself. Phoenix: Oh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that. Bellboy: No, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's \"rep,\" as they say. Phoenix: Huh? \"Rep\"? Bellboy: Yes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir! Phoenix: Whoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder. Bellboy: I, too, will become famous! \"The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee\"...! Phoenix: (Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...) Bellboy: So! You are our honored guest. Please let me know if there is anything I can bring you! Examine Flowers Phoenix: A vase, as expected. I'm not good with flower names, except maybe tulips and sunflowers. Open drawer Phoenix: Huh? There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer! Bellboy: Ah, please leave that as it is, sir. That's the \"Drawer of Terror, Hiding Place of the Murderer's Wiretap.\" It's set to become one of the most popular attractions here. Phoenix: (This guy's serious! I don't believe it...) Table Phoenix: A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. Why hasn't he cleaned these up by now? Bellboy: Ah, I beg your pardon, sir, but if you could please refrain from touching those... It's part of the decor. I call it: \"The last drink... before murder!\" We'll be famous! The talk of the hotel industry! Window Phoenix: Nice weather again today. I can see the Fey & Co. Law Offices, of course. Bellboy: Ah, yes. We plan to install a telescope in that window, of course. Just $5.00 will earn you three minutes of a \"view to a kill\"! Phoenix: ... Bellboy: J-just kidding, sir. Oh hoh hoh hoh! Phoenix: (By that look in his eyes I'd say he was more than serious...) Talk Miss May Phoenix: About Miss May... Bellboy: Oh, her? Sir, not to boast but I knew the moment I saw her... \"She'd do it!\" I said! Phoenix: (Do WHAT!? I'm starting to think the most suspicious person here is this guy!) The man with May Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about the man who was with Miss May...? Bellboy: Ah, yes... He struck me as a real \"Lady Killer,\" if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger. Phoenix: (There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.) Bellboy: If you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him. Phoenix: (A photo. Hmm...) The hotel Phoenix: Could you tell me about this hotel? Bellboy: Absolutely! And on that subject, I have an excellent idea, sir! Currently, this hotel is known as the \"Gatewater.\" I propose that we add a subtitle! Phoenix: A subtitle!? Bellboy: The Gatewater Hotel -- Murder Manor -- Well? What do you think? Phoenix: Um... sounds great! (Whatever floats your tea set...) Present Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A) Phoenix: What about this photo? Bellboy: Well, it's a fine photo, sir. However, the person Miss May was accompanied by was, well, a man. Phoenix: (Oh... yeah. Right.) Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) Phoenix: Take a look at this photo. Bellboy: ... That's him, Detective. Phoenix: Um... I'm the lawyer. Bellboy: Oh, I know that! I just wanted to say \"Detective\" once. You know how it is. Phoenix: (No. No I don't.) Bellboy: Without a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him! Phoenix: An affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...) Have him write it Phoenix: Well, sure. Why not? Bellboy: Yes! I've always wanted to write an affidavit, sir. From hence forth I will be known as \"The Bellboy who swore the affidavit\"! (Changed from [From hence forth I will be known as the 'bellboy who swore the affidavit'!] in the original release) Phoenix: Just hurry up and write it. Bellboy's Affidavit added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (Not even Miss May can play dumb to this!) Leads back to Court Record Turn him down Phoenix: Well thanks, but I don't think that will be necessary. Bellboy: Oh? Oh, I see. Well later then, if you need it. Leads back to Court Record Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (after Bellboy's Affidavit is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Sorry to press the matter, but are you sure this is him? Bellboy: I, too, am sorry to press the matter, but that is him, Detective! Phoenix: Umm... thanks. Bellboy's Affidavit Phoenix: Thanks for this. Bellboy: No no no, not at all, sir! I hope you'll use it to take that Miss May down hard, sir! Hard! Phoenix: (Why do I sense an unhealthy level of excitement behind that unchanging smile? His tea set is rattling!) Anything else Bellboy: I'm sorry... All I could think about during the trial was the hotel... I wasn't paying much attention to the evidence. Grossberg Law Offices (after Bellboy's Affidavit is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: (*sigh* He's out again? Huh? No more photos on the desk...) Detention Center Present Bellboy's Affidavit Phoenix: Could you have a look at this? April: What's that? Phoenix: The bellboy's affidavit! He told us everything he saw. He told us about the man you checked in with. He told us who he was. April: ...! Phoenix: (Now I'm getting somewhere!) Ease her fears Phoenix: (Okay, okay... she's vulnerable now. I should be gentle.) Miss May... It would be easy for me to hand this affidavit to the police. April: ... Phoenix: If they get involved, wouldn't your boss be even more... er... inconvenienced? All I want to do is have a little chat with him. You won't tell me? April: ... Is that all you have to say? Phoenix: Yes. April: Id it's so easy for you to \"get the police involved,\" then why don't you? Somehow I think you're not up to it, hmm? Phoenix: (Show them a little kindness and they jump all over you! That had the opposite effect to what I hoped...) April: Aww. *smirk* Poor little lawyer... And you were so close! Phoenix: (This isn't working... I think I've worn out this piece of paper's usefulness.) Dammit! Bellboy's Affidavit discarded. (Changed from [Discarded the Bellboy's Affidavit.] in the original release) Phoenix: (The man in this photo is the one I want! Why did April May not want to talk about it... she must know him!) Leads back to Court Record Push her hard Phoenix: (This is it, all or nothing! Time to do a little bluff.) No use playing dumb! (If, indeed, that's an act.) If you don't talk, I'm taking this photo to the press! April: Whaaaaat!? Phoenix: Even though he should've been witness to murder, your little \"friend\" is missing. (Changed from [Even though he should be a witness to murder, this man is in hiding.] in the original release) I'm sure the press would have a field day with his reputation! April: ...! Ooooh! Fine! I'll talk! You... you win, Lawyer. Phoenix: (Yes! Man, that felt good! It's great to be alive!) April: Why are you pumping your fists in the air? Phoenix: *cough* Now, tell me about the man you were with. April: That man... He's my boss. Redd White, the president of the information gathering conglomerate, Bluecorp. Phoenix: (Redd... White?) \"Information gathering?\" April: Well... I suppose you could call it a detective agency. (Changed from [Well... I suppose you could call them a detective agency.] in the orignal release) Phoenix: Hmm... So this is the man that was with you the night of the murder? April: ... I'm... I'm scared to talk. I don't want to end up like her! Phoenix: (...!) It's okay, I'll just ask Mr. White himself. Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located? April: ... Phoenix: (Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! If April May couldn't have done it, that leaves him! Time to take action!) Bellboy's Affidavit discarded. (Changed from [Discarded the Bellboy's Affidavit.] in the original release) Leads back to Court Record Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (after presenting Bellboy's Affidavit) Phoenix: How about this photograph? April: You're wasting your time! Miss May's lips are sealed! Gatewater Hotel (after presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: Hmm. The bellboy seems to be out. Huh? The sound of water coming from the shower... Bellboy: \"La-dee-da! Money-Makin'... Money-Makin'... I got the Money-Makin' bluuuues...\" Phoenix: Someone seems to enjoy washing the showers. Examine Open drawer Phoenix: The screwdriver is still stuck in the drawer. I'd better not touch it. No telling what the bellboy would do to me. Table Phoenix: A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. I'd better not touch them. No telling what the bellboy would do to me. Grossberg Law Offices (after presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: (Alright, this is getting ridiculous. Where the heck is that loafer?) Grossberg: *Ah-HHHHEM!* Phoenix: (Ah, that old familiar clearing of the throat...) Grossberg: Ah hah! You again. Phoenix: Um, hello, Mr. Grossberg. Grossberg: ... Well, well. You were quite the thing, my boy. Phoenix: Excuse me...? Grossberg: The trial! The trial! Phoenix: (He was there...?) Grossberg: Reminded me of myself when I was a youth! Phoenix: (I guess something got passed down through Mia... maybe?) Grossberg: It brings back memories, it does! \"Ah... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon...\" you see. ... I apologize. Phoenix: ? Grossberg: I... It was all a bit too much for me, my boy. Seeing you today, I... well, I... ... Phoenix: (I appreciate the reminiscing, but I'd much rather you gave me some information!) Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So you came to see the trial? Grossberg: Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see. I couldn't get a wink of sleep. Phoenix: Really? What was that? Grossberg: Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl. Phoenix: (If you were that worried about it, why didn't you offer to defend her!?) Your refusal Phoenix: I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know. Grossberg: A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy. Phoenix: ... (He does seem troubled about something... Maybe I can find something that will inspire him to talk.) That painting Phoenix: The other day I'm sure there was a big, pretentious-looking painting on that wall... Grossberg: \"Pretentious-looking\"...? Phoenix: Well... you know the one I mean. Anyway, where did it go? Grossberg: Ah, yes, well... I... got rid of it. Got quite tired of the thing, really. I, er, sold it, you see. Yes, that's right. Phoenix: (Sold it!? I'm not sure I buy that...) Wasn't that painting rather important to you, sir? Did something happen? Grossberg: I don't see how it's any of your business! Please, speak no more of that accursed painting. I didn't... I... *mumble* *mumble* Any option (after presenting Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)) Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg...? Grossberg: ... Ah, my apologies. I need to think about things. Alone. Phoenix: (He barely even glanced in my direction...) Present Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (if \"Ease her fears\" was selected upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph... Grossberg: ...! Where did you get that!? Phoenix: I borrowed it. Grossberg: Well, give it back at once! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg. Tell me about the man in this photo. He may have been in that hotel room with April May on the night of the murder. Do you know something about him... anything? Grossberg: ...! Hmm. Ahem! Very well. I'll tell you what I know. However... You didn't hear it from me, if you follow. Phoenix: I follow. Grossberg: That man is Mr. Redd White. He's the President of Bluecorp. Phoenix: (Redd White... Hmm.) Bluecorp... they're something like a detective agency, right? Grossberg: They're information pros. They sell information, you see. Sensitive information. Despite his name, Mr. White has the blackest reputation of any man in this country. Should you run across him, watch what you say. You wouldn't want him digging up any dirt on you. Phoenix: (Hmm... selling information. Sounds like blackmail.) Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located? Grossberg: Hmm... I suppose. Phoenix: (Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! Even if April May couldn't have done it, he could have! Time to take action!) Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg. Grossberg: Now, I must ask you to leave. I need to think about things. Alone. Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (if \"Push her hard\" was selected upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Phoenix: Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph... Grossberg: Where did you get that!? Give it back at once! Phoenix: I'm sorry to have taken it without your knowledge. But... I have to know. Who is this man? He was most likely in April May's room the night of the murder. Grossberg: ! What's that you say!? A-are you QUITE sure? My boy? Phoenix: (What has him so flustered I wonder...?) Grossberg: I... I beg your pardon, but I must ask you to leave. I need to be alone. Phoenix: (...! He's fallen silent as a stone. A rather large stone. I guess I should return that photo.) Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg. Anything else Grossberg: I beg your pardon, but I am not at liberty to speak on the matter. After selecting \"Push her hard\" upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, or selecting \"Ease her fears\" upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, then presenting Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) in Grossberg Law Offices: September 7Bluecorp Inc.CEO's Office Phoenix: ... (What's with the surreal d√©cor...?) ???: Welcome! Please furnish me with the title of your personage! Phoenix: (What the...?) White: Your name! What's your name? I was just inquirably asking the title that you go by. Phoenix: Uh... Wright. Phoenix Wright. (\"Inquirably\"...?) White: Mr. Wright, is it? Right, I see... Splendiferous. Perhaps I have intimidated you with my giantesque vocabulary...? Phoenix: (What is this guy's problem!) White: I'm Redd White, CEO of Bluecorp. You know, Corporate Expansion Official? My business dealings bring me into contact with the elite of the elite. So I'm afraid I am not used to conversing with the wordily-challenged. Phoenix: (What a fruitcake!) White: Hmmm, let me guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this! Phoenix: (What does he mean by that?) White: No matter. So, what business does a \"mighty\" lawyer have with a man such as myself? Phoenix: (Yipes! This guy's arrogance meter is off the scale!) Examine Desk Phoenix: I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing. White: It is modeled on my body, see? Well? Does its sleek roundature not... inspire you? Painting Phoenix: ...? Haven't I seen this somewhere...? Is this a replica? White: Ridiculosity! I have no interest in anything but originals. That right there is a bona fide original! Worth five million, for sure. Phoenix: Hmmm... Statue Phoenix: A statue of a man holding up the world. The \"Bluecorp\" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White. White: Truly a work of art! But, probably to beautacious for you to appreciate, correct? Phoenix: (I think it's a little too \"beautacious\" for just about anyone to appreciate.) Trophy display Phoenix: An impressive line-up of trophies. \"Judges Special Runner-up\" \"Best Participation\" \"Judges Cooperation Award\" \"Special Good Try Prize\" Hmm. The words \"Judges\" and \"Special\" kind of stand out. Window Phoenix: This is the top floor of a 20-story building. The view is quite... presidential. Talk Miss May Phoenix: Miss May is an employee of Bluecorp, is she not? White: Correct. She was my secretariat. What a shock it was to hear what she has done! Phoenix: \"What she has done\"... You mean the wiretap? White: Indeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods! It is ineffable that she would do this. Phoenix: (It sounds like he's trying to turn Miss May into a scapegoat...) Night of the murder Phoenix: On the night of the murder were you in April May's hotel room? White: Who can say? I seldom pay attention to mundane details such as time and place. My motto is: \"Don't worry, be happy!\" Phoenix: Still, Mr. White... The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly. White: ... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that. Phoenix: (Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have \"seen\" the same thing as April May!) White: Oh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement! Bluecorp Phoenix: What kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway? White: Ah, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information. We are a company of the future! You might say, we ARE the future! Phoenix: (Sell... information?) White: In just 10 years, I've built this business up into the grand office you see now. Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color \"blue\"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course! Fantabulistic, is it not? That painting (appears after \"Miss May\" and \"Night of the murder\") Phoenix: Uh... there's something that's been bothering me. White: Yes? What might that be? Phoenix: That big painting on the wall over there... It's gorgeous Phoenix: It's a very striking piece of art. White: Magnificentatious, isn't it! Phoenix: Yeah. ... (Why am I making small talk...?) Leads back to Talk options I've seen it before Phoenix: You know, I've actually seen that painting before. White: Oh? Phoenix: Just yesterday, actually. White: Your point being...? Phoenix: My point is simple. Er, rather, my question is simple: Why is that painting hanging on your wall? Leads to: \"...\" When did you get it? Phoenix: Say, when did you get that painting? White: ... Hmm... no idea! I forgot! Phoenix: I've seen that painting before. Yesterday, in fact. Why do I find that painting here today? Leads to: \"...\" Present Wiretap Phoenix: About this wiretap... White: Ah, the one that Miss May used, right? Bad girl. Bad, bad girl. Phoenix: She testified that she placed the wiretap at your request. White: How pathetic. I guess she's trying to pass the buck. Bad, bad girl. Sorry I can't help you. I know nothing. Phoenix: (I'm going to need hard evidence to get anything out of this guy...) Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) Phoenix: About this picture... White: Gorgeous! That's a picture of me! Ah, I see it was taken in the prime of my youth. About 10 years ago, at a guess. Phoenix: The hotel bellboy says he saw this man on the night of the murder. White: ... On closer inspection, he does look a lot like me, but I'm afraid this is someone else. Nope. That's definitely not me. He's far too young. Anything else White: I am terribly sorry. But that really doesn't seem to concern me at all. White: ... Mr. Wrong, was it? Phoenix: Wright. White: It appears you do not fully grasp your position here. I ask again. Who are you? Phoenix: Umm... huh? A lawyer? White: No, my feeble friend. A \"mere\" lawyer. Worth nothing. Zilch. Zippo. Nada! Just like that sorry excuse for an attorney, Grodyburger! Phoenix: (Wh-what!?) Ungh! Oof...! Unh... uhhh... (He... he punched me!) White: Well, Mr. Lawyer. What will you do, eh? Charge me with assault? Charge away, I welcome it! For it is YOU who will be found guilty! Phoenix: What...? White: Heed my exposition! The police, the courts, they all do my bidding. Phoenix: (So you say... But I wonder... Is that kind of control really possible?) White: I don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume? Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg's... yes. White: Then you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you? Perhaps he will explain how a man can live life purely for personal profit! ... Go now! Skedaddle! There is nothing more to discuss! Examine Desk Phoenix: I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing. Painting Phoenix: This painting was, until yesterday, hanging in Mr. Grossberg's office. Why does White have it now? It's not hard to imagine a few possibilities. Statue Phoenix: A statue of a man holding up the world. The \"Bluecorp\" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White. Trophy display Phoenix: An impressive line-up of trophies. \"Judges Special Runner-up\" \"Best Participation\" \"Judges Cooperation Award\" \"Special Good Try Prize\" Hmm. The words \"Judges\" and \"Special\" kind of stand out. He probably strong-armed them into giving him something. Talk Any option White: Would you be kind enough to cease your inane chattering and vacate the premises? Let me put it in language you are sure to understand: Shut up and get out! I have nothing more to say. Present Anything White: Would you be kind enough to cease your inane chattering and vacate the premises? Let me put it in language you are sure to understand: Shut up and get out! I have nothing more to say. Detention Center (after visiting Bluecorp) Phoenix: Apparently, Miss May is in questioning. I doubt they'll let me talk to her today. Examine Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Grossberg Law Offices (after selecting \"\"I've seen it before\" or \"When did you get it?\" upon selecting \"That painting\" Talk option in Bluecorp) Grossberg: ... ... ... Phoenix: (Huh? I don't think he's noticed me standing here. Maybe I should... clear my throat?) Aaa-HHHEM! Grossberg: Jumping Jehosephats! Oh! You! Phoenix: What's wrong? You looked so pensive... like an old man at the end of his days. Grossberg: Hmm? I'm not senile yet! I was just thinking about this whole mess... Phoenix: (Something's really bothering him, that much is clear.) Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So you came to see the trial? Grossberg: Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see, couldn't get a wink of sleep. Phoenix: Really? What was that? Grossberg: Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl. Your refusal Phoenix: I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know. Grossberg: A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy. Phoenix: ... (He does seem troubled about something... I'm starting to have a feeling I know what it is.) Mr. White Phoenix: So, I paid Bluecorp a visit. Grossberg: Oh? Oh, I see. Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg... I have to admit, something has been bothering me. Grossberg: Oh? What is it? Well, out with it, my boy! Phoenix: You see, it's just... That big painting Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had \"no intention of parting with\"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office. Grossberg: ... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting... Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, I know you and Mr. White are connected somehow! Grossberg: C-connected, you say? Phoenix: Yes! And I know what it is... He's giving you information Phoenix: You're his client, aren't you? He's giving you information! Grossberg: What's that now? Phoenix: You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services! Grossberg: ... Phoenix: You gave him that painting in exchange for some valuable information, didn't you? Grossberg: Utterly ridiculous. Me, his client? I would never willingly deal with that man. Never! Phoenix: (Huh? Did I get it wrong?) Leads back to Talk options He's blackmailing you Phoenix: Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail? Grossberg: ...! Phoenix: I think that painting is fairly gaudy proof. Grossberg: ... Very well. This may be the chance I've been waiting for. Maybe it's time to get this off my chest, so I can finally rest easy again. After all, you were Mia's understudy. Perhaps it was fate? Phoenix: (What's he talking about...?) Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" You're lovers Phoenix: It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you! Grossberg: W-w-what! My boy! Phoenix: You sent that painting to him! As a sign! A sign of undying love! Grossberg: M-m-my boy, please! You're letting your fancies run away with you! Where do you get these bizarre ideas? Phoenix: I... I don't understand how you could... Grossberg: That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous! ... Enough. I'll swallow my pride and tell you all. Phoenix: (I knew it! They are lovers!) Grossberg: N-no! We are NOT lovers! Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" That photo of Mr. White Phoenix: That photo of Mr. White... Why would you have his photo, Mr. Grossberg? Grossberg: Umm... yes, well. It's been a long time since then... Phoenix: A long time ago? I'm sorry... but I think not. I think you still have ties to Mr. White even today. Grossberg: R-really! Whatever gave you that idea! W-what connection could I possibly have to an individual such as he? Phoenix: It's pretty straightforward, actually... You go drinking together Phoenix: You go drinking together! You're friends, aren't you? Grossberg: ... Now you're being foolish, my boy. Why in the world would I ever drink with the likes of him!? Phoenix: (Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.) Leads back to Talk options He's blackmailing you Phoenix: Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail? Grossberg: ...! I don't... I don't know what you're talking about! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had \"no intention of parting with\"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office. Grossberg: ... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting... Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg... tell me what happened. Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" He's giving you information Phoenix: Redd White is supplying you with information, obviously! Grossberg: What's that now? Phoenix: You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services! Grossberg: ... Now you're being foolish, my boy. What possible use could I have for the services of the likes of him!? Phoenix: (Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.) Leads back to Talk options Why wouldn't you defend Maya? Phoenix: I thought it was strange. Here was Maya, your own apprentice's little sister, in desperate need... Accused of killing her own sister no less, and you wouldn't take the case! I finally realized why. You and Redd White are connected. He's... Your boss Phoenix: I'll bet you and White go way back! He's your boss now, and was before, I bet! Grossberg: My what? Boss? Are you serious? Phoenix: Yeah! You both have that sort of \"we're in the same club together\" feel to you. Grossberg: Please, stop. You have a very peculiar sense of humor, Mr. Wright. Very well, I'll talk. Phoenix: (What does he mean... \"sense of humor\"? I was serious!) Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" Blackmailing you Phoenix: Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail? Grossberg: ...! I don't... I don't know what you're talking about! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had \"no intention of parting with\"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office. Grossberg: ... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting... Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg... tell me what happened. Leads to: \"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\" Your lover Phoenix: It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you! Grossberg: W-w-what! My boy! Phoenix: Mr. Grossberg. The other day, there was a giant painting hanging on that wall. I saw that painting again, today. It was in the CEO's office of Bluecorp. It was a present, wasn't it? Grossberg: Well, my boy, you have a splendid imagination! Phoenix: I... I don't understand how you could... Grossberg: That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous! Phoenix: (Hmm... I guess I was wrong. But it just seemed so right!) Leads back to Talk options Present Anything Grossberg: Sorry, my boy. I don't think I can help you with that. Grossberg: Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now... Phoenix: (15 years...!) Grossberg: All because of the \"DL-6 Incident,\" as you may have guessed. Phoenix: (The name on the back of those photographs!) Grossberg: As you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did. Phoenix: (So that's the connection!) Grossberg: It is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible. Phoenix: Impossible? Why!? Grossberg: He has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians. Phoenix: What!? Grossberg: They are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years. Talk The DL-6 Incident Phoenix: What is the \"DL-6 Incident\"? Grossberg: \"DL-6\" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium. Phoenix: (A medium...?) Grossberg: Her name was Misty Fey. Phoenix: (Fey!) Grossberg: Indeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud. Phoenix: (This is what Maya was talking about the other day!) Grossberg: I did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident. Reason for blackmail Phoenix: But why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg? Grossberg: The DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him. Phoenix: You told White? Grossberg: He offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail. Phoenix: ... I see. Grossberg: ... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office. Phoenix: Mia's office...? Grossberg: She followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found. Fey & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Reason for blackmail\" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices) Phoenix: It's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look. Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: All the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here. They're in alphabetical order. Let's take a look... Which file should I look at...? File \"A-I\" Phoenix: Let's see if there's \"A\" record in this file that catches my \"I.\" \"A\"... \"B\"... \"F\"! \"Misty Fey.\" That's Mia and Maya's mother. Hmmm... Should I take a look? Read it Mia: \"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press. This parasite, who makes his fortune on threats and coercion... His name is...\" Phoenix: Hmm. The record stops there. ... So Mia knew Grossberg... Leads back to examination Leave it be Phoenix: I don't think it has much to do with the current case. I'd be interested to know what it contains... but I'll leave it alone for now. Leads back to examination File \"J-S\" Phoenix: Let's see... \"J\" through \"S\"... Nothing much in here. Maybe I'll just skim some of this? Skim Phoenix: *sigh* Well, no harm in flipping through a bit, I guess... The biggest part's here at the end in \"S\"... \"Suicide\"? Eww... She has a collection of suicide reports. There's politicians... policemen... ... ...! There's writing on most of these in pencil. \"White\"...? This is Mia's handwriting. Wait, I get it! Mia thought he was involved in these \"suicides\"! White drove them all to... ... I can use these newspaper clippings. Hmm... let's find the most disturbing one... Newspaper Clipping added to the Court Record. Leads back to examination Leave it be Phoenix: Nah... this is taking too long. Later. *yawn* I've never been good at reading these things. Leads back to examination File \"T-Z\" Phoenix: \"T\"... \"U\"... I know, \"W\"! \"White\"! ...¬†! The entire \"W\" section is missing! Was it taken...? Leads back to examination Bookshelf (after Newspaper Clipping is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Shall I check Mia's files once more? Check 'em Phoenix: Which file to check? File \"J-S\" Phoenix: Hmm... not much in the \"J-S\" section. I'm not sure reading suicide accounts will be very good for my mood... I think that's enough reading for today. Leads back to examination Leave 'em Phoenix: I don't see much point in checking files that are missing all the key parts. *yawn* I give up. Leads back to examination Grossberg Law Offices Present Newspaper Clipping Phoenix: I found this in Mia's files... Grossberg: So she was investigating Redd White, as I expected. Well, if you wanted to challenge him, you could present this in court. Phoenix: (Not a bad idea...) Bluecorp (after Newspaper Clipping is added to the Court Record) White: Well, aren't you persistent. Phoenix: Sorry, but there's something I have to ask you. White: Mr. Lawyer, I really hate having to repeat myself... But it seems the message has not yet penetrated your thick skull... Stop bothering me! If you try my patience further, I fear a nasty accident may occur. Do I make myself clear? Phoenix: (Transparent...) Talk Miss May Phoenix: (I think we're past needing to talk about April May. I've got to put this guy on the spot, and quick!) White: Hmm? What's the matter? You seem... distressed! Night of the murder Phoenix: (This guy is a pro at pulling the wool over people's eyes. I've got to put him on the spot, and quick!) White: Stop that! Your hot gaze is giving me goosebumps! Blackmail Phoenix: (There's no point asking someone this crooked a straight question! I need some evidence I can use as ammo...) White: What's wrong? Is something stuck to my face? Why yes! There's my eyes, and my nose, and my mouth... But of course I jest. You need not restrain your mirth, my friend! It is okay to indulge in my cosmopolitan sense of humor. I will not think less of you. Present Newspaper Clipping Phoenix: (This is the only clue that Mia left me... I'd better make this one count!) Mr. White... see this? It's an article describing the suicide of a politician. White: ... Phoenix: He was embezzling secret government funds. Then, one day, word got leaked to the press. The very next day he took his own life. White: And this concerns me how...? Phoenix: I found this article in Mia's office. White: Miss Mia...? Phoenix: She had a file filled with articles like this. Every one of them was labeled with a single word... \"White.\" White: ...! Phoenix: Mr. White, I know what you did to this politician. You bribed him Phoenix: You bribed him! White: B-bribed!? ... What exactly has led you to say this? Phoenix: (Um... gee, that's a good question. I guess I got ahead of myself there...) White: Hmph. You certainly have an active imagination. Phoenix: (Dammit!) Leads back to Court Record You spied on him Phoenix: You were spying on him, weren't you? White: \"Spying\"...? Phoenix: You snooped on him, and found out about the embezzlement. Then, when you revealed it, he was driven to suicide! White: Mr. Lawyer. I know nothing of this. And, even in the highly unlikely event that I did do such a thing... All I would have done is provide \"information.\" That is not a crime in this country. Phoenix: (Gah! This guy's as cool as a cucumber...!) Leads back to Court Record You blackmailed him Leads to: \"You were blackmailing him!\" Anything else White: I have no intention of parleying with you about this matter. Phoenix: You were blackmailing him! White: Blackmail? Phoenix: Not just him, either. You were threatening and coercing hundreds of others! You were involved in all of the suicide cases that Mia investigated! This company is built on blackmail! I'm right, aren't I? White: What a bizarre accusation. Mr. Wrong... What is it that you should be doing now? Investigating me? No no no. I think not! You should be searching for the one who killed Miss Mia! Interphone: *beep* [Secretary's Office, hello?] White: Mr. Wrong will be leaving now. Interphone: [Yes, sir. I'll send someone right away.] Phoenix: Wait a second, Mr. White... You're right Phoenix: You are absolutely right. I should be looking for the killer now. And actually, I've done better. I've found him. He's sitting right in front of me. Leads to: \"Just what are you insinuating?\" You're wrong Phoenix: You're wrong, Mr. White. White: Excuse me? Phoenix: What I should be doing now is going after you! Leads to: \"Just what are you insinuating?\" White: Just what are you insinuating? Phoenix: Mia was on to you. She was keeping tabs. For this reason you had April May tapping her phone. Then, Mia was murdered, and all the documents about you mysteriously disappeared. So, the culprit would be...? White: ... Phoenix: Even a child could work it out, Mr. White. You did it! White: ... Interphone: *beep* [Secretary's office.] White: We won't be needing an escort for Mr. Wrong. Instead, please connect me to the public prosecutor's office. Interphone [Of course, sir. One moment please...] ... [White? That you? What are you doing calling me at a time like this!?] White: Hello. Chief Prosecutor? I've changed my mind. I want to testify tomorrow. Interphone: [What's this about?] White: The Mia Fey case. I witnessed the murder, you see. And, thus, as a very important witness, I would like to testify. Interphone: [What? Why now? I thought you said you didn't want to go to court?] White: Quietude...! I told you I changed my mind, didn't I? Oh, and one other thing. Send the police over here right away. The man is standing right in front of me. He looks dazed but could be violent! Interphone: [What? What man?] White: Are you even listening? The executioner! The hatchet-man! The liquidator... The killer, man! Phoenix: What!? Interphone: [Mr. White... this isn't another one of those...] White: Chief Prosecutor. I do not believe you are in a position to freely offer your opinions to me, correct? I'm telling you to send the police, now! Interphone: *beep* White: ... Did I not tell you, Mr. Wrong? You are a mere lawyer! As was Miss Mia. Phoenix: How dare you! White: I'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled. No lawyer of any worth will defend you. I have friends in the local lawyer's association, you see. You'll be given a lawyer so stupendously inept that they make even you look competent. Phoenix: (I... I feel faint.) Gumshoe: Detective Gumshoe, reporting, sir! Aaa! Butz! Hairy Butz! Phoenix: Wright, actually. Phoenix Wright. And my friend's name is \"Larry\"... Gumshoe: Oh, right! Sorry, pal. Butz was that murderer, right? White: Detective Gumshoe. I present to you, the man who killed Miss Mia Fey! Gumshoe: W-what!? White: Take this despicable human being into custody. ... Farewell, Mr. Wrong! September 8, 3:37 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: I can't believe it's only been a day since the first trial. My trial begins tomorrow. White's going to set a trap for me. And the prosecution will be in on it, of course. Edgeworth, included. An attorney was assigned to me by the state, yesterday. I refused. I had an idea. Maya: ... Wright! Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Oh, Maya! Great, they let you out of detention. Maya: Just now, yes. It's all thanks to you! Phoenix: Hah. Now I'm afraid we've switched places. Maya: What? You mean, you...? Phoenix: I explained what had happened to Maya. ... Maya: I don't believe it! How many people does that man need to destroy before he's satisfied!? My mother... My sister... And now you! This has gone too far! Mr. Wright, please tell me, is there anything I can do? Phoenix: Um... well... Defend me in court Phoenix: Alright, you can be my defense lawyer tomorrow! Maya: Alright! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Leave it to me! I am Mia's sister, after all! Lawyership runs in our blood! Phoenix: (Wasn't it ghost powers that ran in your blood...?) (Changed from [Wasn't it E.S.P. that ran in your blood...?] in the original release) Maya: I'd better run to the bookstore and pick up a copy of \"Law for Rookies.\" Leads to: \"...\" Cheer me on in court Phoenix: Well, you could cheer for me in court. Maya: Cheer for you? You mean... like a cheerleader? Phoenix: Huh? Um, yeah, like that. Maya: Alright! Leave it to me! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: I'd better go get a uniform and some pom-poms...! Leads to: \"...\" Help me break out of here Phoenix: Right. Okay, listen up. I want you to help me break out of here! Maya: You mean... a jail break? Phoenix: Yeah. Tonight's our only chance! Maya: Alright! Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Oh, I'd better go get a hacksaw while the stores are still open. Oh, oh! And a rope ladder, and a getaway car! Can you drive? Leads to: \"...\" Phoenix: ... W-wait. Wait wait wait. Maya: What what what? Phoenix: I'm kidding! It was a joke! Maya: No way! Phoenix: No really, I was kidding. But thanks. It's good to know you're on my side. (And there really isn't anything you can do for me anyway...) Maya: But... but I can't just sit here and do nothing! I've got to give that man a piece of my mind! Phoenix: (Just a piece...?) Okay. Then, come to the court tomorrow. Maya: O-okay! I'll be there! I'll show them a thing or two! Phoenix: Times may change, yet with crime it's the same old story. (Changed from [It's the beginning of a new century, yet with crime it's the same old story.] in the original release) In fact, it's gotten worse. Lengthy court proceedings are no longer realistic. Beginning a few years ago, a limit of three days was put on initial court trials. Almost all finish in a day. Most with a guilty verdict. I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself for this case. (Changed from [I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself.] in the original release) With the true culprit appearing as the star witness. (Changed from [Tomorrow the true culprit will appear as a witness.] in the original release) This is it! Tomorrow, it's me or him! (Changed from [This is it!

We have a responsibility to protect client confidentiality!White: That is when I saw this glass light stand.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why did you notice something as innocuous as a light stand!?

    "cot": "The receipt (Evidence 3) shows a purchase of the glass light stand on September 4, the day before the murder. However, Redd White's testimony (Testimony 3) states that he saw the glass light stand already at Fey & Co. Law Offices when he entered to place the wiretap, which could have been earlier than the purchase date on the receipt.\n\nThis means White's testimony about seeing the glass light stand is contradicted by the receipt proving the stand was bought only the day before the murder.\n",

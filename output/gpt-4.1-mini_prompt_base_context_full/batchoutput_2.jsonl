However, if the Professor died at midnight, and Tusspells was working before dawn (about 4 a.m.), rigor mortis would have already set in, contradicting the timing and conditions of her testimony that the body was still limp.\n\nThus, the contradiction is between the precise time of death recorded in Evidence 16 and the implication of the state of the body described indirectly in Tusspells's testimony (though the exact testimony number is not listed). Since the testimonies related to the rigor mortis and Tusspells's time taking the impression are not specifically enumerated here, the closest matching testimony that contradicts this evidence is the one that involves Tusspells's testimony about the timing and condition of the body which conflicts with the autopsy report.\n\nGiven the listed testimonies, none talk about rigor mortis directly, but Testimony 6 by Sithe mentions \"The truth about the execution ten years ago is a state secret,\" indicating concealment about the timing. Also, Testimony 0 to 2 are about the arrangement of the body and note at the crime scene, less relevant here.\n\nConsidering this, the best choice matching the contradiction is:\n\n- Evidence 16: Killer's Autopsy Report (time of death midnight)\n- Testimony 0 (Sithe's testimony that she had to arrange the body, implying control over the timing and the condition)\n\nBut since the rigor mortis testimony isn't in the list, the contradiction is best represented as Evidence 16 (autopsy report) contradicting Testimony 6 (Sithe's testimony about protecting the truth of the execution).\n\nTherefore, the contradictory pair is Evidence 16 and Testimony 6.\n\n{\"evidence\": 16, \"testimony\": 6}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 81335, "completion_tokens": 451, "total_tokens": 81786, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_38647f5e19"}}, "error": null}

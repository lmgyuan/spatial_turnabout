One of the black raven... ...and one of the white raven. A country torn in two. One to the west... ...and one to the east. When those which were split are made whole again... ...the truth will reveal itself. I-It's the Yatagarasu! The Yatagarasu's here! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! -- 8 Hours Earlier -- March 14, 10:17 AM High Prosecutors' Offices - Room 1202 Edgeworth: (It's so nice, almost dreamlike, to finally have the chance to relax and sip some tea. Especially after what a whirlwind the past few days have been.) On my return flight, I was dragged into a case involving an Interpol agent's murder. The next day, I investigated a kidnapping and a murder at the Gatewater Land theme park. And later that night, a detective's dead body welcomed me back to my office... ...along with a thief who was out to pilfer files related to a case from 10 years ago. (How did I manage to find myself in the middle of so many cases back to back? Well, at least I have today. All I ask is that I be allowed to spend it quietly.) ???: Mr. Edgewooooorth! This is big! Big, I tell you! ...Hey, what's wrong with you? Where's your enthusiasm...? Edgeworth: And suddenly, the phrase \"the fragility of dreams\" comes to mind... Kay: What are you talking about, \"fragile dreams\"!? Come on, let's go! The fake Yatagarasu isn't going to just find herself, you know! Edgeworth: Well, if you must know... it's possible that I was paid a visit last night by your \"fake\". Kay: Say what? Edgeworth: ......... Edgeworth: Unfortunately for us, the thief managed to escape. But even now, we're still looking for this criminal. However, I must warn you that we've only had a few hours to search so far... ...so I must insist that you be patient on this one, Kay. Kay: Wh-What's with you today...? Are you sure you aren't sleep-talking to me right now? Anyway, I've got something much more important that I want you to see! Edgeworth: Oh, and that is? Kay: Take a look at this! Edgeworth: \"On March 14th, I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" That's quite a bold declaration to send to an embassy... (I suppose it was inevitable that a newspaper would catch wind of this.) Kay: The date the card mentions is today! Edgeworth: Today, huh... Kay: Come on, we've gotta hurry! The embassy awaits! Edgeworth: I suppose it IS quite an urgent matter... ...however, do you know which country's embassy we should be investigating? Kay: Well, it's some really special country, and I'm actually really fuzzy on the details... But never mind that! Where's all your energy!? Why are you so lackadaisical today!? Edgeworth: I'm not, Kay. You're just too wound up. Kay: Well, then you should get too wound up, too! Because this just might be our chance to catch that woman! Edgeworth: You mean Ms. Yew? (The woman who killed Kay's father, Byrne Faraday, seven years ago... Calisto Yew... She claimed to be the Great Thief Yatagarasu... ...and then disappeared from the courtroom.) Kay: Argh! She makes me so mad! The phony! Everyone knows that the real Yatagarasu would never send something like a calling card! Until a company's underhanded dealings are made public... ...the target is always totally unaware that the Yatagarasu has paid them a visit. That's what makes the real Yatagarasu so awesome! Edgeworth: Hmm... The Yatagarasu's card that's shown in this article... It looks to me as though it could be genuine. Kay: See, that's the thing. Whoever it is, that person isn't the real deal, but has knowledge of the Yatagarasu. If this isn't a clue that that woman's involved, then nothing is! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Out the door you go! Edgeworth: Wait, there are a few preparations I must make before we go... (There's something interesting about this card we found last night here in my office... It's of a different color than the one in the article, which makes me wonder why.) Kay: What's up? Any reason why you're boring a hole through the newspaper with your eyes? Edgeworth: No... No reason at all. Very well. Seeing as how Ms. Yew is also someone of a special nature to me... ...I agree there is some merit to be found in investigating this. Kay: I knew you'd come around! March 14, 5:00 PM Theatrum Neutralis ???: By the light of this night's glorious moon... We are ready! Pink Princess: Ready to embark on our nightly outing. Steel Samurai: And this is where... ...our tale begins! Edgeworth: Heh... What a coincidence. Who would've thought that a Steel Samurai stage show... ...would ever be held at such an elegant theater inside a foreign embassy? Examine evidence Prosecutor's Badge Front of badge Edgeworth: This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so. Back of badge Edgeworth: Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else! Kay: Yeah! The climax was really awesome! \"Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\" I got chills down my spine when he pulled that move out! Edgeworth: I suppose it really is more impactful to watch a show in person than on television. Kay: I have to say, though, this embassy is set up kinda funny. I mean, they have two countries sharing the same building! Edgeworth: Well, as you said yourself, this place and the countries it houses are very special. Even this theater is special in that it is a neutral zone shared by the two countries. Kay: Umm... So, let me get this straight... The Steel Samurai show just now is being sponsored by one of the two countries. The one that's called the Kingdom of Allebahst, right? Edgeworth: Yes, it would appear that the Steel Samurai is very popular in that country as well. Kay: Seems that way! But you know who I'M really into? The Jammin' Ninja! The Republic of Babahl is sponsoring a Jammin' Ninja stage show! That's something for fangirls like me! We've totally gotta see that too, Mr. Edgeworth! The Jammin' Ninja's show is gonna kick the Steel Samurai show's rear end! Edgeworth: (You know, ever since I first met this girl, I've always had this inkling... ...that what she really wants to be... ...is not a thief, but rather, a ninja...) Kay: So anyway, about today's event... umm... What's it called again? Edgeworth: \"The Kingdom of Allebahst versus The Republic of Babahl Goodwill Jubilee\". The small, European countries of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...and the Republic of Babahl. These two countries used to be a single entity that was abundant with nature. And it was called... the Principality of Cohdopia. .................. Kay: Hm? Is everything alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Yes, I'm alright. Moving on... After a period of civil unrest, the country split in two, though signs of their past remain. For example, their flags preserve the flower and butterfly motifs to this day. ......... (Cohdopia, huh... The KG-8 Incident... and what was referred to as the second KG-8 Incident... ...in which an Embassy staff member was murdered... Both of these cases were related to the Principality of Cohdopia. In the seven years that have passed, the country may have split into two... ...however, the Yatagarasu still sent a calling card here. What could it all mean?) ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I know you're thinking about something! Edgeworth: Oh, excuse me. What were we talking about again? Kay: Argh, if you could please stop spacing out on me! Anyway, we were talking about the Allebahst versus Babahl Goodwill Jubilee. The two countries have had a pretty bad relationship with each other... ...but supposedly, they've been trying really hard to make up recently. That's why they decided to hold this event. Edgeworth: (If that's the case, then why the \"versus\"...?) Kay: Also, both countries claim to own the real \"Primidux Statue\", a national treasure to both. They're planning to have them publicly evaluated today, to see which one's the real deal. Edgeworth: Kay, need I remind you to take care and not succumb to your thieving desires? Kay: Well, when it comes to treasure, I can't help myself. You know that! Edgeworth: (Nngh... She had better be saying that in jest...) Kay: Hey! I can read your body language, you know! And you've got it all wrong! Look! I'm here to do some investigating! INVESTIGATING, I tell you! Edgeworth: Heh, I know. And although we don't know if the Yatagarasu will really make an appearance... ...I suppose we should still spend some time examining this place. Talk Guard by left door Guard: Is there something I can help you with? Edgeworth: I was wondering what is beyond these doors. Guard: It's the Allebahstian Embassy. Now, unless you have some business with the Embassy... Edgeworth: (I suppose I can't really claim to have any business with the Embassy right now.) Kay: Well, you don't have to be so rude about it, Mr. Guard! Hrmph! Man in blue suit Man: Ten more minutes... No, in five more minutes... But isn't it really bad for me to spend time doing this? It's no use! Would someone please just tell me what I should do! Edgeworth: You appear to be troubled by something. May I be of any assistance? Man: Leave me alone! I'm trying to figure out just the right time to talk to that girl over there! And if I mess up, it'll be because I'm talking to you right now! Kay: Somehow, I get the feeling he's about to fall flat on his face. Edgeworth: Well, let's just do as he wishes and leave him alone. Girls by pamphlets Fan: You know, I've seen a lot of these shows in a bunch of other places... ...but today's show, it was like they went for a complete comedy, know what I mean? Friend: Yeah, And that last move, the Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Sushi Slice] in the original release)... I couldn't help but laugh! Fan: I know, right!? And that Pink Princess's movements were really stiff. In the middle of the show, I could swear that I heard her hip crack. Friend: Oh, I know! I totally thought that, too! The Pink Princess has a bad hip!? Seriously!? Just what were they thinking, you know!? Edgeworth: (I suppose there is no graceful way to enter this conversation...) Man in green suit Man: This is... the perfect angle! Edgeworth: ? Man: Go, my image! Travel across the wave world and into every TV set around the globe! Edgeworth: (A more honest approach to appearing on TV might serve your ambitions better...) Reporter Reporter: And we're here, reporting live from the Theatrum Neutralis. As you can see, tonight's audience is full of enthusiasm! Let's see what this member of the audience has to say. Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Cameraman: OK, that was good. Let's do one more run-through! Edgeworth: Excuse me, but when you are ready to film for real, would you mind giving me a call...? (I sense that she didn't hear a single world I just said.) Cameraman Cameraman: OK, OK, that's good. Alright, now give me a dramatic \"slam!\" right there! Stop! Stoooop! Hey, do you mind!? Get out of the way, buddy. OK, once more! In 3, 2, 1, action! Edgeworth: Kay, was that my fault just now? Kay: Well, he's obviously working... I guess we should leave him alone. Boy by TV Edgeworth: (It appears that the child is watching a video from the first season of the Steel Samurai.) Child: ♪Go! Go! Keep on fighting, until your last breath!♪ ♪Go, my hero, the Steel Samurai!♪ Edgeworth: (Completely absorbed in singing the theme song, I see... I'll let the child watch in peace.) Camerawoman (Lotta Hart) Cameraman: Where in tarnation are they!? Come on, big scoop! Hey, mister! Outta the way! Yeah, I'm talkin' to ya! Edgeworth: Nngh... (I seem to remember this woman from somewhere... ...yet my instincts are directing me not to engage in conversation with her. Perhaps it would be best if I left her alone.) Guard by right door Guard: Is there something I can help you with? Edgeworth: I was wondering what is beyond these doors. Guard: The Babahlese Embassy is just beyond these doors, sir. Do you have some business with the Embassy? Do you require immediate access? Edgeworth: Ah, no, that's quite alright. Guard: Are you sure, sir? Anyone and everyone is always welcome in the Republic of Babahl! Kay: Well, then! Since we're here! Edgeworth: An embassy isn't some sort of theme park, Kay. Kay: Tch! You're such a buzz kill! Examine Pamphlets Edgeworth: There are pamphlets about the two embassies here on this table. Kay: Hmm... It still looks weird to me. Edgeworth: The country split into two a few years back. And they've shared the building and its grounds 50-50 ever since. Kay: Oh? I guess it's because they don't have the money to build two separate ones, huh? Edgeworth: I-I should think that's not the reason why, Kay. Flag by left door Edgeworth: The national flag of the Kingdom of Allebahst is on display here. The crest on it features a flower. Kay: Flowers and butterflies are kind of rare motifs for flags, don't you think? Edgeworth: Well, when they used to be Cohdopia, the government used to take pride in its land. The citizens also loved the rich, bountiful nature all around them, thus the design. Kay: Hey, if the Steel Samurai got popular enough, do you think they'd put him on their flag? Edgeworth: Are you in your right mind, Kay? Kay: Hmm... Or maybe the Jammin' Ninja would make a better candidate...? Edgeworth: (Hah, don't make me laugh (changed from [Heh, don't make me laugh, Kay] in the original release). Only the Steel Samurai deserves such an honor.) Flowers on left side Kay: Those are some nice flowers! I wonder who they're from? \"Gatewater Imperial Hotel\"? Where's this, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Ah, it's an ultra-luxurious hotel that sponsors the Steel Samurai series. I've been there once to investigate a case. Kay: Oh? So what kind of case was it? Edgeworth: I believe it was related to the Nickel Samurai and the Jammin' Ninja... Kay: Oh, I remember reading about that! You must be the head of Steel Samurai affairs down at the Prosecutor's Office, huh? Edgeworth: (I should think that even you can figure that such an office does not exist, Kay.) TV Edgeworth: There is a flat-panel, a tape deck, and a row of Steel Samurai videos on this table. I suppose it's so visitors can watch an episode or two at their leisure. Kay: I guess it really is just that popular, huh? Edgeworth: Yes, although I never thought I would see it reach this level of popularity... Kay: I wonder why they decided to call on the Steel Samurai for an event like this? I mean, it's like they intended to cut the two countries apart with the Samurai Sword instead! Edgeworth: (Wouldn't that go against the whole point of this event...?) Flowers on right side Edgeworth: These flowers were sent by Global Studios. Kay: Global Studios? Edgeworth: That's where they film the Steel Samurai television show. They have been producing hit after hit recently, so the studio is being remodeled. Kay: Oh! I read about that in the papers the other day! That mascot of theirs is also getting a face-lift, too, right? Umm... what's its name? Edgeworth: You mean Mrs. Monkey? Kay: Yeah, I thought it was something like that! You really have a great memory! Edgeworth: Hah! Never underestimate my powers of recollection. Flag by right door Edgeworth: The national flag of the Republic of Babahl is on display here. The crest on it features a butterfly. Kay: It's really rare to see a national flag featuring an animal on it! Edgeworth: Not really. I can list at least a few off for you that do. Kay: OK, then are there any flags with really chic things on them? Edgeworth: \"Chic\" things? That's pretty vague, Kay... Although, by my definition, there aren't really any flags that feature a \"chic\" object. Kay: Aww, that's too bad. Because if there was, I was thinking about stealing it... Edgeworth: (And what exactly would you do with a stolen national flag, Kay...?) Partner Edgeworth: There's a very festive atmosphere in here. Kay: Yup, super festive! I'm really happy for the Kingdom of Allebahst and the Republic of Babahl. It's great that they have re-established diplomatic relations! The newspapers say that it's almost like they're Cohdopia once again. Edgeworth: Perhaps we are bearing witness to a historic moment in time. Kay: Hey! Look! They're selling some commemorative merchandise to celebrate this event! Founder's Cohdopia Biscuits. And over here, they're selling Royal Cohdopia Biscuits. Edgeworth: ...It would seem that they have yet to reconcile their competitive spirits. After examining pamphlets: Edgeworth: I suppose I'll just help myself to one of these... Embassy Guide stuck into the pages of my Organizer. Edgeworth: (Hm? What is all the hubbub?) Ack! Kay: Hey, look! It's the Steel Samurai! And he's got his son, the Iron Infant, with him!! Talk Steel Samurai Leads to: \"May I speak with you for a second?\" Edgeworth: May I speak with you for a second? (...It's... the Steel Samurai...) Steel Samurai: ......... Edgeworth: ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! What are you glaring at him for!? Edgeworth: Ahem, please excuse me. It's just that I've never seen a super-hero up close before. Steel Samurai: ......... Kay: It looks like he's written something down for you! Edgeworth: \"To Edgeworth, From Steel Samurai Daddy: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo\" Kay: Wow, an autograph! Pretty cool that you got one, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Heh... Steel Samurai's Autograph received. Guard: Mr. Steel Samurai! Ambassador Alba is waiting for you! Reporter: And now the Steel Samurai... ...will proceed to enter the Kingdom of Allebahst to shake the hand of the ambassador. The Steel Samurai isn't only here for the two countries tonight... ...but rather, can be thought of as a goodwill ambassador from our own country as well! Kay: There he goes. Off to spread goodwill to the world. Edgeworth: He really does seem like a goodwill ambassador, doesn't he? Cameraman: OK! We're shooting the next segment now! Cue camera! Reporter: In just a few seconds, the Jammin' Ninja stage show is set to begin. After the show, the Jammin' Ninja will enter the Republic of Babahl. He is set to meet with the Ambassador of Babahl at that time. Kay: AHH! The Jammin' Ninja's show is about to start! We've gotta get back to our seats! Edgeworth: Regrettably... I don't have much of an interest in ninjas... Kay: Well, this show will change your mind! Come on, we have to hurry! If we miss even a second of the Jammin' Ninja's awesome playing, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I suppose you're not about to give me much of a choice here, are you, Kay?) Kay: Ahhh! I could listen to that \"A Ninja Marked for Death's Lullaby\" song all day! His superb playing and that sad melody really brought a tear to my eye! And his heart-wrenching voice! Now THAT'S the Jammin' Ninja's greatest weapon! Edgeworth: .................. Kay: Ahh! Those pieces of Jammin' Ninja merchandise over there! I've got to have them! I especially want the hair sticks they're selling exclusively at these shows. They're exactly like the ones the heroine, Princess Misola, wears in her hair! Edgeworth: ...Anyway. Kay: Anyway!? ANYWAY!? Hold it right there, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: You're thinking of going home, aren't you!? Edgeworth: Well, it doesn't seem likely that the Yatagarasu will be making an appearance tonight. Most likely, it was simply a prank. Kay: No way! I just know the Yatagarasu will show! Edgeworth: But I thought you said that the Yatagarasu doesn't send calling cards. Kay: Yeah, I did, but... Edgeworth: I figured from the very beginning that this would wind up being a wild goose chase. Kay: But that card she sent was a genuine fake calling card! Edgeworth: A genuine fake...? Kay: Well, how can I word this...? The Yatagarasu's mark that's on the calling card is exactly the same as my mark. Get it now? Officer: W-We've got a problem! Th-The Yatagarasu has been spotted in Allebahst! Edgeworth: What!? Kay: You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Hah! So you finally decided to show yourself, you phony! Hey, what gives!? Guard: I'm sorry but I will need to search you before you may enter. Kay: What the!? Hey! The Steel Samurai just waltzed straight on through without one! Now if you don't hurry up and let me through, my phony is going to escape! Edgeworth: Kay, a country's embassy is considered to be a part of the country itself. If you don't go through the proper procedures to enter the country... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm going to enter through Babahl and climb over the wall into Allebahst! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You would tell a prosecutor straight out that you intend to illegally enter another... Kay, are you listening to me!? Kay: Kay Faraday, and I'm coming through! Guard: Yes, and welcome! Edgeworth: Someone stop her! Anyone! March 14, 6:12 PM Open-Air Stage Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay... Where are you? Don't tell me you really did find some way over this fence... Ack! Guard: Fire! This is too big for us to handle! Looks like the Yatagarasu came to Babahl, too! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! You had better be alright, wherever you are! March 14, 6:45 PM Babahlese Embassy - Secretariat's Office Kay: I told you! It wasn't me! Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay! Are you alright!? Kay: Do I look alright to you!? Now, can you do something about this woman!? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe! What is the meaning of this!? Gumshoe: *sigh* Well, sir... it's um, this. Edgeworth: He's...! Kay: It wasn't me! He was already dead when I ran in here, hot on the heels of the fake Yatagarasu! Look, I only came in here because I saw a suspicious person at the open-air stage! Edgeworth: A suspicious person? Kay: A long, black coat and a hood over their head -- I dare you to tell me that's not suspicious! When I saw that person, I immediately thought that they must be the fake Yatagarasu. So I chased after them into the Embassy, then into here, and then lost sight of them... But I just KNOW that person is the one who did it! Shih-na: What are you so worked up over? There is no reason for you to be this loud. Edgeworth: Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're Agent Lang's secretary... ...Shih-na, I believe your name is, correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: And if you are making an arrest... ...I assume you have evidence that it was Kay who committed the crime, is that also correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: You refuse to answer!? Shih-na: I don't need to answer. Edgeworth: ! Shih-na: You are merely a prosecutor in this country, meaning you have no investigative authority. Gumshoe: H-Hey, pal! Just what the heck does what you just said mean!? If it happened here, it's under Mr. Edgeworth's jurisdiction. The end. And seeing as how this building is sitting on our soil, we can investigate wherever we'd like! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, Detective, embassies are a different matter. Gumshoe: Huh? Edgeworth: This office is considered to be a part of the Republic of Babahl. Which means that anything that happens in here... ...defaults to the control of the Babahlese government and Babahlese law... ...giving them exclusive extraterritorial rights. Gumshoe: Extraterrestrial (changed from [Extraterristrial] in the original release, correcting the typo) rights? Sir, do you really believe that the truth is out there!? Edgeworth: *sigh* Basically, our country's laws do not apply inside the embassy of another country. That's what was agreed to by our respective governments. Our authority to investigate was effectively nullified the second we entered this place. Which means we can do little here in this situation... Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! Shih-na: Please leave this matter in Interpol's hands and go home. Edgeworth: N...Nnnnngh... Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Kay: H-Hey, you're not...!? Mr. Edgeworth! ???: ???: In that case... allow me to join your investigation. Gumshoe: M-Ms. von Karma! Eeek! Franziska: Ambassador Palaeno, I truly appreciate you allowing me to join the investigation. Palaeno: It's really nothing. Manny was my secretariat, so of course I want to help you as much as I can. In fact, it's a blessing that Interpol agents were able to make it so quickly. Edgeworth: Franziska... Franziska: Well, well. I never imagined that I'd meet you here of all places. This is an embassy, meaning that you have no authority to conduct... Edgeworth: Franziska: A-Already!? What is it!? Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Hm? And you are? Edgeworth: I'm Miles Edgeworth, public prosecutor. I ask that you please allow me to investigate this case as Ms. von Karma's assistant. Gumshoe: A...Assistant? Franziska: Miles!? What the heck do you think you're...!? Edgeworth: Please, I implore you, Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Very well. I'll be counting on the two of you, Ms. von Karma and Mr. Edgeworth. Gumshoe: Umm... What did you mean by you'll be Ms. von Karma's assistant...? Edgeworth: I don't exactly have a choice, do I, Detective? If I don't become Franziska's assistant, I can't participate in this investigation. Franziska: Hmph. There you go again, running at the mouth with that aloof expression on your face. Edgeworth: Franziska, please... Franziska: I don't know what you're planning quite yet... ...but at least I do know one thing -- that you are now my subordinate. Just remember that my whip is always ready to wake you, should you have a brain lapse. Edgeworth: Of course. I'll keep that in mind. Shih-na: ...If you are done playing games...! Edgeworth: Right. let's begin the investigation. Begin Investigation Babahlese Embassy - Secretariat's Office Edgeworth: By the way, Detective... I suppose it's a bit late to be asking, but why are you here? Gumshoe: Well, better late than never, I guess, sir. I was placed on guard duty for the Babahlese Embassy today! Edgeworth: And why are our police guarding an embassy? Gumshoe: Well, on account of the card they got from the Yatagarasu... ...they called us up and asked for our help, sir. Oh, and because we've been searching for the Yatagarasu these past seven years! It was a more or less mutually beneficial arrangement, if you ask me! Edgeworth: Except for how mutually unbeneficial this has all turned out to be, I suppose. It looks like you failed to competently perform your guard duty yet again. Gumshoe: Ack...! Edgeworth: Look forward to your next salary negotiation... although, it's out of my hands. Gumshoe: But sir! If it gets cut any more, I won't be able to buy even instant (changed from [packet] in the original release) noodles anymore... Talk Franziska von Karma Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What is it? Franziska: Let me tell you something. You are currently my subordinate. And if you wish to convince everyone else of that, you will speak to me with respect! Edgeworth: (What's with the giddy glint in her eyes?) I don't think that will really be necessary, Franziska. Franziska: Oh, really? Well, it doesn't matter. It doesn't change the fact that you are still under me. Edgeworth: (I thought Franziska was flying around the world in pursuit of the smuggling case. So then, why is she here at this embassy (Franziska's return - Why is she here when she is supposed to be overseas in pursuit of a smuggling ring?)...?) Talk The murder Franziska: I was investigating at the Allebahstian Embassy when I got wind of this mess. Edgeworth: Ah, that's right. The Yatagarasu was due to appear at that embassy as well. Franziska: Yes, but the difference is that we didn't have a fire over there. Although, there was an incident at the Allebahstian Embassy as well... But I left Agent Lang in charge of that case and came over to the Babahlese Embassy. Edgeworth: Ah... So Agent Lang is here as well, huh? Franziska: I see you've met. Well, he's in the Allebahstian Embassy acting as body guard for Ambassador Alba. ...However, he seems to have a different reason for being there. Yatagarasu (appears after \"The murder\") Franziska: So the suspect in the murder that occurred in this office is that little girl, I see. Is she, perhaps, trying to be the Yatagarasu? Gumshoe: K-Kay would never harm a soul, sir! Franziska: ...Kay? Edgeworth: You remember, do you not? About the case we investigated together seven years ago? That girl is the daughter of the victim in that case, Mr. Faraday. Franziska: ! So she's that feisty little girl... Edgeworth: Kay has been on the trail of the Yatagarasu, which is how she ended up here... ...looking for the one who took her father's life. Franziska: ...I see. Gumshoe: Kay's trying so hard, but you know what!? The Yatagarasu just keeps on tricking us all! Edgeworth: Hm...? How so? Gumshoe: The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret (Stealing of secret - The card warned that the Yatagarasu will steal the embassy's 'dirtiest secret'.)\"... ...but all we've had is an arson and a murder! The lab boys are going in circles! You know what this is, sirs!? It's a breach of contract, and it's going on the rap sheet! Franziska: If you ask me, I'm perfectly fine with the fact that nothing was stolen tonight. Edgeworth: (I do wonder, though, if Calisto Yew really is the Yatagarasu...) Smuggling (appears after connecting \"Stealing of secret\" and \"Franziska's return\" Logic) Edgeworth: Franziska, when we last talked, you said that you were on the trail of a smuggling ring. I suppose the reason you are here right now is related to that? Franziska: ...Yes. After analyzing the intel we've gathered from various countries... ...this embassy... rose to the top of our list of sites to investigate. And this is what tipped us off. Edgeworth: This accounting document...? Franziska: It's only one page of the whole thing, so we're not sure about all the details... ...however, it's enough for us to grab onto the tail of the beast. For you see... this type of paper was made only in the Principality (changed from [Kingdom] in the original release) of Cohdopia. Which means that somewhere in the countries of Allebahst and Babahl is the head! The one pulling the strings behind the entire smuggling ring! Edgeworth: (That's Franziska for you... She's amazing -- pursuing this case with all she has.) Cohdopian Paper Document data jotted down in my Organizer. Smuggling (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Franziska, when we last talked, you said that you were on the trail of a smuggling ring. I suppose the reason you are here right now is related to that? Franziska: ...Yes. After analyzing the intel we've gathered from various countries... ...this embassy... rose to the top of our list of sites to investigate. And this is what tipped us off. Edgeworth: This accounting document...? Franziska: It's only one page of the whole thing, so we're not sure about all the details... ...however, it's enough for us to grab onto the tail of the beast. For you see... this type of paper was made only in the Principality (changed from [Kingdom] in the original release) of Cohdopia. Which means that somewhere in the countries of Allebahst and Babahl is the head! The one pulling the strings behind the entire smuggling ring! Edgeworth: (That's Franziska for you... She's amazing -- pursuing this case with all she has.) Present Prosecutor's Badge Franziska: What about your Prosecutor's Badge? I have one, too, you know. Edgeworth: Ah, yes... So you do. But seeing as I'm not currently a proper prosecutor, I thought I'd give presenting it a try. Franziska: ............ Is that any way for you to act towards your superior!? Edgeworth: As if threatening a whipping is the proper way of lecturing someone! Notes on Coachen's Body Franziska: It appears that he died of a stab wound. Arngh!! Whoever did this had a lot of nerve! I just can't fathom what could've led the killer to turn a knife against a man! Edgeworth: And I just can't fathom what the prosecutor lashing out with her whip is thinking... Knife or Yatagarasu's Key Franziska: Would you mind not pointing that in my direction? It's dangerous. And anyway, why are you showing it to me? Edgeworth: I have no particular reason... Franziska: !! Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Franziska: If you have no reason! Don't you bring that dangerous object near me! Do you understand!? Edgeworth: ! (I-Is she really that oblivious to the irony in that statement? She lets loose that dangerous whip of hers for no reason all the time!) Cohdopian Paper Document Franziska: We were able to finally obtain this proof of the smuggling operation through Interpol. So remember to take extra care when handling it... my subordinate. Edgeworth: *sigh*... (She's enjoying the power trip of calling me her subordinate just a taaaad too much...) Anything else Edgeworth: Ms. von Karma, what do you think of this piece of evidence? Franziska: Hmph, well, since you asked so nicely as my subordinate, I'll answer you. However, as your superior, I also must make sure that my subordinates grow on the job. Therefore, please gather your own thoughts together first, and then try presenting again. Edgeworth: (A simple, \"I don't have any thoughts about that\" would've sufficed...) Colias Palaeno Palaeno: I can't believe that Manny fell among thieves tonight... Without him, I have no idea what my schedule for tonight is. Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, I believe your schedule tonight will consist of... ...listening to reports from the police. That and only that. I ask you to cooperate not only for your own sake, but for Mr. Coachen's as well. Palaeno: ...You're a rather strong man, aren't you? How fascinating! Here, I know it isn't much, but I'd like you to have these. Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but it would be against my principles to accept a bribe. Palaeno: Oh, no, no. These are simply coupons we distribute to promote Babahl. Remember, we offer a large number of discounts and offers when you visit lovely Babahl! Edgeworth: (Now I remember. The Republic of Babahl is known for its feverish tourism industry...) Talk Manny Coachen Edgeworth: I was wondering if you might tell me a bit about the deceased, Manny Coachen. Palaeno: He was my secretary, and the embassy secretariat, charged with running the whole place. He was an admirable man. His death is a great loss to our country. He was in charge of everything, accounting, printing, taking care of our national treasures... Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but did you say \"printing\"? Palaeno: Our country's primary source of revenue is our tourism industry. So, in order for us to print the necessary pamphlets, flyers, coupons, etcetera... ...we have a printing press here at our embassy. Edgeworth: I see. Please excuse my forwardness, however... ...I feel I should mention that I have the distinct impression that I've met him before. Palaeno: ! Oh, yes... Since you are of the legal profession, I suppose you just might have. After all, Manny was involved in the KG-8 Incident. Edgeworth: Th-The KG-8 Incident!? Palaeno: The defendant who was found innocent in that case was Manny. Edgeworth: So your Mr. Coachen is the same man as the one in that case... Palaeno: It's been 10 years. Manny recovered personally from that case, and dove enthusiastically into this job. He was the one who planned this event, and was to oversee this embassy's renovations. It really is a shame. He had such a bright future ahead of him. Renovations (appears after \"Manny Coachen\") Edgeworth: What exactly did you mean earlier by \"renovations\"? Palaeno: We can't have tourists and visitors to our embassy think we're a poor nation, can we? So renovating the embassy is something of an investment. We may have a rather paltry budget, but we're trying our best to make do (changed from [due] in the original release, correcting the typo). However... ...I guess the only person who could've helped us do our best is now no longer with us. Cohdopia (appears after examining key on body and clearing \"Manny Coachen\" Talk option) Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, I was wondering if I may ask you about Cohdopia. Palaeno: Cohdopia? Alright. What would you like to talk about? Edgeworth: First... I'd like to ask you about this key. Palaeno: Hm? What about this key? Edgeworth: I found it sticking out of Mr. Coachen's pocket. I believe it originally belonged to this embassy. Is that correct? Palaeno: Hmm... Upon closer inspection, it seems that this key is shaped like a butterfly. Edgeworth: That's not all about this key. It's also capable of changing into a knife. Palaeno: Oh! How fascinating! Edgeworth: (Is it possible that the ambassador didn't know about the existence of this key...?) Palaeno: ...Hm? In its knife form, there is a flower mark at the base of the blade. Hmm... I guess this knife might be from when we used to be a part of Cohdopia. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And how did you come to that conclusion? Palaeno: It has both of Cohdopia's national symbols, the butterfly and the flower. I suppose Manny used this key here at the embassy (Key used at Embassy - This key was stolen from the Cohdopian Embassy 7 years ago by the Yatagarasu.) back when we were still Cohdopia. Franziska: Ambassador Palaeno, this key was stolen from the Cohdopian Embassy seven years ago... ...by Calisto Yew, otherwise known as the Great Thief Yatagarasu. Palaeno: ! O-Oh, really? Edgeworth: You were not aware that Ms. Yew had broken into this embassy at that time? Palaeno: I'm sorry I can't be of much help. I'm not very familiar with the details, you see. I only became the ambassador after Babahl became its own independent nation. But if Manny were still alive, he would probably know about what happened back then... Edgeworth: (Mr. Coachen and Ms. Yew knew each other seven years ago... But that doesn't explain why I found the Yatagarasu's Key here in the present.) Present Prosecutor's Badge Palaeno: Oh, is that a Prosecutor's Badge? It has a very cool design! Aha! I know! We should start selling items like this as souvenirs in Babahl! The tourists will absolutely go nuts over them! Edgeworth: (Please don't compare a proud symbol of my profession to a cheap souvenir...) Embassy Guide Palaeno: Oh, isn't that about our great embassy? Ah... How do you like our pamphlets? Edgeworth: I feel indifferent about them, to be honest. I'm just using this as evidence. Palaeno: Oh, that's too bad... In that case, I guess we'll just have to try harder to make more charming ones! ! I-I just had a flash of inspiration! We should make all of our pamphlets into coupon books! Edgeworth: ............ (His expectations of what a coupon can do is just a tad hyper-inflated.) Notes on Coachen's Body or Knife Palaeno: Oh, dear... If people were to find out that a murder occurred at our embassy... ...the number of tourists would plummet, as would our revenues! It'd be a disaster! What are we going to do...? Edgeworth: (He really does seem worried. Perhaps I should refrain from bringing this up...) Babahl's Primidux Statue Palaeno: This statue resembles that hero, the Steel Samurai, don't you think? I was thinking, what would you say to changing its name to the \"Steel Samurai Statue\"? It just might attract a few more tourists to our country if I did, right? Edgeworth: I-I'm not sure what to think... (I thought that thing was a national treasure...) Anything else Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, I was wondering if you might have some thoughts on this. Palaeno: I think that you would know more about the case than I. So let me make it up to you for not knowing anything about that with these coupons! Edgeworth: ...Thank you, however, I feel I must decline. Officer Officer: Sorry, but Interpol is still conducting its investigation beyond this point. Edgeworth: I'm a subordinate of Ms. von Karma. Is there some reason why I'm being denied access? Officer: My superior clearly stated, \"Don't you dare let anyone near the site, you got it!?\" If I let you examine the site, my superior would get really angry at me! Gumshoe: You know, Mr. Edgeworth... I feel really bad for the guy, so why don't we do as he says? Edgeworth: Yes... I suppose we might as well. Shih-na or Kay Faraday Edgeworth: Kay, are you alright? Kay: You believe me, don't you, Mr. Edgeworth? You don't think I did it, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, of course I don't. And I promise to prove that it wasn't you. Shih-na: That's enough chit-chat. You can investigate all you like, but it's only a matter of time before we take her in. It would be wise of you to give up while you can. Edgeworth: No, I don't think so. Kay isn't lying, and my investigation will prove that to be true. Shih-na: Go ahead and try then, if you're that confident. Edgeworth: (I can't allow this to continue on this way. I must prove her innocence post haste!) Examine Fireplace Gumshoe: That's some fireplace! You know, it really gives this place a mansion-like quality, don't you think, sir!? Ooh! If these are a staple in every Babahlese house... ...then I bet Santa Claus pays them a visit, too. Edgeworth: (Just how old are you again, Detective...?) Safe Edgeworth: A small, personal safe... Franziska: This was Mr. Coachen's office. So perhaps he stored his most important documents in here. Edgeworth: Ah, of course it's locked. It appears we won't be able to open it without the key (Locked safe - The secretariat's office safe. It can't be opened without the key.). Body Edgeworth: So our victim... was the secretariat of this embassy, I take it. Franziska: Manny Coachen. I heard that he was an admirable person... very admirable. Edgeworth: The cause of death is a stab to the base of his neck... He was lax in watching his back. Franziska: We were fortunate that the fire missed our victim's body for the most part. If the fire had burned a bit longer, it would've made identifying him a hassle. Edgeworth: (So Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death in the middle of a raging fire...? What in the world happened inside this room?) Notes on Coachen's Body jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Body Edgeworth: (Hm? This man... Where do I know him from...?) Wound Edgeworth: It's a knife wound. Franziska: It's obvious what he was killed with, but I wonder if it's consistent with the wound? Shih-na: Indeed. Knife Edgeworth: Is this knife the murder weapon...!? Shih-na: Some preliminary testing has been conducted. According to the results, the blood on that matches the victim's blood. The blade's shape was also found to be consistent with the stab wound. Edgeworth: I suppose this means that we now know that the crime was committed with this knife. Gumshoe: This knife's got some really fancy ornamentation going on, huh, sir? This thing practically screams \"ARTSY!\" at me, too! Although, it's also covered in blood, just like the last thing that I said was artsy... Franziska: Hmm, but the handle is pristine, there's not a single drop of blood on it. Speaking of the handle... I believe it has a butterfly motif (Motif on knife handle - A butterfly-shaped guard adorns the handle of the murder weapon.). It's very beautiful. Knife data jotted down in my Organizer. Knife (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Is this knife the murder weapon...!? Shih-na: Some preliminary testing has been conducted. According to the results, the blood on that matches the victim's blood. The blade's shape was also found to be consistent with the stab wound. Edgeworth: I suppose this means that we now know that the crime was committed with this knife. Gumshoe: This knife's got some really fancy ornamentation going on, huh, sir? This thing practically screams \"ARTSY!\" at me, too! Although, it's also covered in blood, just like the last thing that I said was artsy... Franziska: Hmm, but the handle is pristine, there's not a single drop of blood on it. Speaking of the handle... I believe it has a butterfly motif. It's very beautiful. Key Edgeworth: Hmm... There appears to be something in his pocket. ! This key! It can't be...! Isn't this the Yatagarasu's Key that was stolen seven years ago!? Franziska: What!? But that's...! Gumshoe: Huh? Seven years ag...oooh! You mean that case where I was framed, sir!? Edgeworth: Yes, it's the piece of evidence that stole the life of Kay's father seven years ago... ...which was then stolen by Calisto Yew. Gumshoe: Wh-What!? Mr. Faraday was killed with this key, sir!? I thought he was killed with a knife... Eeeek! Franziska: Scruffy! At the very least, try to remember the details of crimes you were a suspect in! Edgeworth: Franziska, as you will recall... ...Detective Gumshoe was not present when Ms. Yew made her escape. Plus, even among law enforcement, only a few knew of this key's existence. I doubt that a new rookie at the time would've been made privy to such knowledge. Gumshoe: Ooonnngh... I feel like the victim right now, all trampled on, sir! Edgeworth: Hmph... I suppose I'll just have to fill you in now. The secret to this key is...! Leads to examination of Yatagarasu's Key Examine butterfly=shaped key Edgeworth: It's not that far-fetched to think that the end of this key was meant to be a butterfly. The key maker must've been a true patriot to have fashioned this after the national symbol. Examine button in handle Leads to: \"Ohoooo!\" Gumshoe: Ohoooo! Wow, that's amazing, sir! It's like some kind of magic trick! Yatagarasu's Key data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: I knew it. This is the same exact piece of evidence that Ms. Yew took with her... I remember this beautiful pattern in the blade. Franziska: I remember this as well. It's a vine motif, isn't it? Edgeworth: Yes, it looks like two interwoven vines, crisscrossing down the blade. Gumshoe: Vines, sirs? I think it looks like a bunch of stars, if you ask me. It's one of those six-sided stars, just like the police mark on our IDs! Edgeworth: I... really don't think you can call these stars. (...To say that the detective's art sense is underdeveloped would be an understatement.) Franziska: The real question is why was the Babahlese Embassy's secretariat holding this? Edgeworth: While we don't know how Mr. Coachen came to possess this key... ...we do know that this was stolen by the Yatagarasu from the Cohdopian Embassy. Franziska: That's right. Mr. Faraday had written that fact down in his organizer. Edgeworth: I believe this means that further research is required into the country of Cohdopia. Franziska: Why don't you ask Ambassador Palaeno about what he knows? Supposedly, he was a candidate to be the next Cohdopian ambassador once long ago. He should be able to answer any specific questions you may have. Key (subsequent times) Edgeworth: It's the Yatagarasu's Key... I wonder how it managed to return here? Gumshoe: So this key was stolen by Calisto Yew seven years ago, right? Edgeworth: Yes, although originally, it was stolen from this very building. Gumshoe: Well, then, maybe Ms. Yew just decided to bring it back. Edgeworth: I can't dismiss that possibility, however... (...it doesn't fit her modus operandi, given all of her other actions.) Body (after examining knife and key) Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Butterfly on wall Gumshoe: Heeeey! It's another butterfly! Edgeworth: I believe it is the symbol of the Republic of Babahl (Buttlerfly of Babahl - National symbol that adorns the national flag. Allebahst's flower is its counterpart.). A drawing this big on the wall of an embassy... It definitely conveys a sense of overwhelming patriotism. Gumshoe: Well, I've got a lot of patriotism, too, sir! The reason I became a cop in the first place was because I wanted to protect our country! Edgeworth: You may want to, Detective, however, I have yet to see the fruits of your desire. Gumshoe: Y-You don't have to be so blunt about it, sir! Broken ceiling fan Edgeworth: This ceiling fan must've fallen from the ceiling. Gumshoe: A ceiling fan? What does one of those do? Edgeworth: Exactly what it sounds like it does; it's a fan that is installed on one's ceiling. Gumshoe: Well, if I had one of those in my room, I bet I'd go dizzy from staring at it as I slept. Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. In the real world, we close our eyes when we sleep. Golden statue Palaeno: Because this is a national treasure, can I ask that you please not touch it? I'm afraid the only ones allowed to touch it are myself and the secretariat. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But there is a possibility that it is related to the murder, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Why don't we give up for now? We can force them to let us investigate it later when we find some solid proof! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I don't have a choice here. (This must be one of the Primidux Statues Kay was talking about earlier. ............ Is it just me or does this man look just like the Steel Samurai? They could be twins.) Babahl's Primidux Statue data jotted down in my Organizer. Golden statue (subsequent times) Palaeno: Because this is a national treasure, can I ask that you please not touch it? I'm afraid the only ones allowed to touch it are myself and the secretariat. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But there is a possibility that it is related to the murder, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Why don't we give up for now? We can force them to let us investigate it later when we find some solid proof! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I don't have a choice here. (This must be one of the Primidux Statues Kay was talking about earlier. ............ Is it just me or does this man look just like the Steel Samurai? They could be twins.) Knife rack Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! There's still something on this display rack, sir! Edgeworth: Knives, huh... Although, the blades are all that remain of them, unfortunately. Gumshoe: I guess the handles all got burnt off by the fire. Palaeno: Ah... So even the knives fell victim to the fire... Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, are these knives yours? Palaeno: Why yes, they are. They are a special set of ornamental knives featuring the national symbol of Babahl. These butterfly-themed knives, along with Allebahst's own set of knives... ...are comprised of three knives each. But... But I can't believe the Babahlese ones have been reduced to this state... Edgeworth: Hmm... (Ornamental knives, huh? ...Hm? There's a small release on the tang of this blade.) Ambassador Palaeno, what is this notch here for...? Palaeno: Oh, that! It's a feature of these knives wherein you can freely exchange the handles on them. So that we can change how they look to fit the situation, of course. Edgeworth: I see. So these knives were constructed so that the handles could be easily removed. Shelves Edgeworth: These shelves are lined with American souvenirs and memorabilia. Gumshoe: It's really strange isn't it? I mean, I thought this was the Babahlese Embassy! So, umm, why are there so many American souvenirs, sir? Edgeworth: Perhaps the Babahlese are studying American culture and our tourism industry...? If they have plans to make the Babahlese tourism industry truly flourish... ...then they would need to observe and study other countries' methods, I suppose. Gumshoe: Speaking of tourism, I got these from the blond guy earlier, sir. He said that if I bring these with me to Babahl, I can trade them in for a few buffets! Edgeworth: Oh? So, how do you expect to travel to Babahl? Gumshoe: Well, the whole world is connected by the oceans, sir! And for an all-you-can-eat buffet, I'd swim all the way to Babahl if I have to! Edgeworth: (Can a few simple coupons really motivate people to do such fantastic things?) Burnt objects by clock Edgeworth: There are still some burnt objects scattered on the floor. Gumshoe: Well, burnt things get burnt and then they become burnt things, you know? Edgeworth: No, because there is no way to prove that the burnt thing started out as a burnt thing. Gumshoe: Was it a burnt thing, or was it not? I have no idea what's what anymore, sir... Edgeworth: Yes, I suppose it's a bit hard for someone with a burnt-out light bulb to comprehend. Grandfather clock Edgeworth: It looks like this was once a magnificent grand father [sic] (changed from [grand grandfather] in the original release) clock, but it has fallen victim to the fire. Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! Is it OK for me to talk about the clocks in my house, sir? Edgeworth: If they're unrelated to the case, I hope that you will refrain from sharing, but... Gumshoe: Well, there's this one clock that I made by myself, but the timer on it manages to auto... Edgeworth: That's quite enough, Detective. Examine evidence Knife Blade Edgeworth: So this is what took Mr. Coachen's life. Some of his blood is still on the blade. Gumshoe: Wow, I've been a detective for 7 years already? I've seen a lot of weapons in my days... ...but knives that were used to kill are always the hardest for me to bear. Edgeworth: Yes, unlike guns, this is one weapon where you're likely to find the victim's blood on it. Gumshoe: Yeah, just like how this one is practically drenched in it, huh, sir? Edgeworth: (Despite that, it looks like the blood managed to miss the handle somehow.) Ornate butterfly on handle Edgeworth: There is a lot of skilled detailing on this handle. I believe this is a butterfly. Gumshoe: This is one amazing ornamental knife. And I'm really glad that this beautiful butterfly wasn't ruined by blood. Edgeworth: There is not even a drop of blood on it. It really is quite exquisite. So much so that even you can understand its beauty, Detective. Gumshoe: Hey, why do you always have to look down on my tastes, sir!? I know what I like, and this is really well-crafted! Edgeworth: (Why do I look down on his tastes...? Because, my dear Detective, I'm afraid your tastes are usually quite questionable...) ! This knife... It would appear that the handle is removable. Gumshoe: I guess so people can change them whenever they feel like it. Sounds like fun, sir! Edgeworth: (I don't think people would remove the handle just for fun, Detective...) Yatagarasu's Key Knife blade Edgeworth: There is a vine motif to the ornamentation on this blade. Even if Detective Gumshoe claims to see a star motif in it. Between the blade and handle, there is a flower, and the key itself is a butterfly. This key was stolen by the Yatagarasu seven years ago from the Cohdopian Embassy... ...which suggests that this was made while Cohdopia still existed as a country. Button in handle Edgeworth: We discovered this trick seven years ago, and with it, we were able to corner Ms. Yew. But who would've thought that I'd see this key again after all this time... Butterfly-shaped key Edgeworth: It's not that far-fetched to think that the end of this key was meant to be a butterfly. Logic Connect \"Locked safe\" and \"Key used at Embassy\" Leads to: \"We know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy.\" Connect \"Stealing of secret\" and \"Franziska's return\" Edgeworth: \"To steal your dirtiest secret\"... Is it possible that the \"dirty secret\" the Yatagarasu was out to steal is in this very room? Franziska: \"Dirty secret\"? Edgeworth: Franziska, you're in pursuit of some \"dirty\" underhanded dealings yourself, are you not? Something tells me that this is no coincidence. Franziska: In that case then, the person I'm looking for is here in the Babahlese Embassy, huh? The head of the smuggling operation! Edgeworth: (I think I just might need to ask Franziska about her smuggling case in more depth.) Connect \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\" Edgeworth: The design on the knife's handle... ...it greatly resembles the special Babahlese species of butterfly. Franziska: It does, doesn't it? Plus, it says right here. Edgeworth: \"This knife is property of the Republic of Babahl.\" Perhaps this means that the knife used in the crime was found right in this room...? Partner Gumshoe: Yes, sir? Talk The murder Edgeworth: While you were on guard duty, did you notice anything unusual? Gumshoe: Well, I was on watch inside the Embassy... ...but unfortunately, I didn't run into the Yatagarasu, sir. But I did talk to an officer who was on duty near the border between the two Embassies... ...who told me that not a single person crossed the boundary during the incident. Edgeworth: I see. Gumshoe: The investigations into the fire and the Yatagarasu are a mess thanks to both events! I'm so confused, sir! Should I be putting the fire out or investigating!? What do you think, sir!? Edgeworth: ...Aren't you old enough to solve your own problems yet, Detective? The investigation Edgeworth: I'd like an update on how the investigation is going. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah... Well... it's going, sir! Edgeworth: In other words... ...no one has any idea of what happened here, correct? Gumshoe: To put it simply... yeah, you got it, sir. But! We do know that something happened in this room, sir! Edgeworth: Any moron with a pair of eyes can see what happened, Detective. Gumshoe: Aww... W-Well, anyway! Let's investigate every single nook and cranny in this room, sir! We have to get serious, or Kay will end up getting arrested as the killer! Edgeworth: Yes, I am already well aware of that. Gumshoe: Oh... Edgeworth: (In order to find out what really happened here in this room... ...we will need to gather whatever information we can. It's time to take a good look.) The crime scene (appears after clearing \"Yatagarasu\" Talk option with Franziska von Karma and examining knife near body, key on body, safe, and butterfly on wall) Gumshoe: It looks like all that's left is a bunch of burnt stuff... But, well, I guess we've got all the info we need now, huh, sir? Edgeworth: Yes, it would appear so. Gumshoe: But you know, after all is said and done... ...I still have no idea of what's going on! Nope! Not a clue, sir! I just can't figure it out... Edgeworth: Hmph... Detective Gumshoe. It's nothing to get so worked up over. Gumshoe: Oh! You mean I should use that thing, right!? Umm... Defunction? No, that's not it. Projection? No, no, that's not it either. I think it sounded like... Oh, I've got it! \"Lock it\"! Edgeworth: ...It's \"logic\", Detective. Logic. (Now that I've collected some information, the next step... ...is to connect a few of them together to see if I can make sense of this mess!) Present Prosecutor's Badge Gumshoe: Hey, it's your Prosecutor's Badge! This thing's really important, right? So what would happen if you lost it, sir? Edgeworth: Why are you asking me such an ominous question? Gumshoe: Well, because I've lost my police badge before, sir! I just wanted to tell you to be careful, sir! Because writing the explanation section on those requisition forms is really annoying! Edgeworth: (I believe SOMEONE needs to listen to his own advice a bit more often...) Yatagarasu's Key Gumshoe: Hmm... So this is the Yatagarasu's Key, huh? That's a really nifty trick they built into it. I can't stop playing with it! This is great! It's like one of those transforming toys, sir! Edgeworth: E-Evidence is not meant to entertain, Detective! Anything else Edgeworth: What do you notice about this piece of evidence, Detective? Gumshoe: Umm... Well, uh... I don't really sense anything special about it... But the embassy is a different story! Edgeworth: .........I see. Gumshoe: ...I'm not really sensing anything special from you either, sir... Edgeworth: Well, I'm sensing a special look at your monthly salary, Detective! After connecting \"Locked safe\" and \"Key used at Embassy\" Logic: Edgeworth: We know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy. Furthermore, we found it in the victim, Mr. Coachen's pocket. Which leads me to think that perhaps it is the key to the personal safe in this office. Gumshoe: Good thinking, sir! Let's go try it out! Edgeworth: ...It appears I was correct. (The key that was left to us in the victim's pocket... It literally turned out to be the key to the next piece of the truth!) Hmm... What do we have here? Gumshoe: Hey! There's nothing inside! D-Do you think the Yatagarasu made off with everything, sir? Edgeworth: No, Detective, I believe all we need is a closer look. Leads to examination of safe Examine Safe Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Piece of paper Leads to: \"What is this here?\" Oddly shaped hole Gumshoe: Hey, there's a hole here, sir. Edgeworth: (It's a little too oddly shaped for a latch hole...) Gumshoe: Wow, that's a funny shape for a latch hole, huh? It's shaped kinda... like a star, don't you think, sir!? Edgeworth: Detective, I would hardly call that shape a star... (There must be some reason for this hole...) Gumshoe: Well, there's gotta be some reason why this hole's shaped so weirdly, you know!? Edgeworth: (Am I over thinking this? No, I don't think so...) Gumshoe: Hmm, maybe I'm over thinking things? Nah, there's no way I could ever do that, ho ho! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, could you please be quiet for a second? You're frightening me. Inside of safe Gumshoe: It looks like such a serious safe, but there's not a scrap of paper inside... Which reminds me, the safe in your office is just as empty, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: It's merely a coincidence that both safes are empty, Detective. Gumshoe: Well, make that a triple coincidence because my piggy bank at home is empty, too... Edgeworth: I don't think there's anything coincidental about that, Detective. Edgeworth: What is this here? Gumshoe: It looks like the ripped corner of a piece of paper, sir. Edgeworth: No, I don't think it's ripped; it seems more, to me, like it's stuck in the safe. Gumshoe: Hey, you're right! It won't budge an inch, not even when I tug on it! But I don't think I've ever seen paper stuck on the inside of a safe before... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective, I think you have it backwards. It's not the paper that's strange... It's the safe. Gumshoe: What do you mean? Edgeworth: What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that... it has two compartments. Leads to: \"Even just eye-balling it, you can see that the inside is a bit too shallow.\" it's completely empty. Edgeworth: There is nothing in the safe. Gumshoe: Well, yeah, there's nothing in the safe... but what's that got to do with anything? Edgeworth: Hmph... Why is the safe here in the first place? Gumshoe: Umm... To keep really important things safe, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, precisely. However, there is nothing inside this safe... ...which points us to a clear contradiction of facts! Gumshoe: .........But remember when we checked out your safe that time, and you answered... Edgeworth: Right now? Nothing. Gumshoe: ...when I asked you what was inside? Wouldn't that count as a contradiction, too, then? Edgeworth: Arngh! (I suppose there are times when there just isn't anything that needs to be safeguarded. Alright, time to recollect my thoughts...) Leads back to: \"What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that...\" it has a crack there. Edgeworth: Hmph... It is just as it appears to be. There is a crack in the safe, from where the lodged piece of paper is protruding! Gumshoe: Yeah, that's exactly what it looks like, alright. Edgeworth: Nngh... Franziska: We already know, so there's no reason for you to state the obvious so confidently, Miles. Edgeworth: N...Nngh... Gumshoe: Hey, I feel like I'm a step closer to understanding what it's like to be Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Drat... It appears the only thing I managed to do here is waste time.) Th-That wasn't what I had meant to say! The paper is sticking out, and that in itself is an important fact. So... Leads back to: \"What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that...\" Edgeworth: Even just eye-balling it, you can see that the inside is a bit too shallow. Furthermore, with the unnatural way the paper is stuck at the back of the safe... ...I'd say that there is an extra bit of space behind the back wall of this safe! In other words, this safe has a second compartment. Gumshoe: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? Franziska: I suppose that you are correct in asserting that the paper is stuck in an unnatural manner. However, if what you say is correct and there is a second compartment... ...how do we go about opening the door to it then? As you can see, there is no other lock or keyhole in sight. Edgeworth: Actually, there is one more spot of interest to me on this safe. Franziska: Oh? Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe that spot is the keyhole to our mystery second lock! Franziska: The safe and its locks... Alright then, since you are so sure of yourself, show me how you deduced your answer! Leads to examination of safe Examine Safe Examine Piece of paper Franziska: I suppose that you are correct in asserting that the paper is stuck in an unnatural manner. However, if what you say is correct and there is a second compartment... ...how do we go about opening the door to it then? As you can see, there is no other lock or keyhole in sight. Edgeworth: Actually, there is one more spot of interest to me on this safe. Franziska: Oh? Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe that spot is the keyhole to our mystery second lock! Franziska: Alright then, since you are so sure of yourself, show me how you deduced your answer! Deduce oddly shaped hole Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Yatagarasu's Key Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Doesn't the shape of this keyhole remind you of something, Franziska?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence is the key to the safe! Franziska: I'm not entirely convinced it is... ...but I'm willing to entertain any explanation you may have. Edgeworth: Ack! Gumshoe: Don't worry, sir! I'm sure you're right in what you said! Although... I'm not quite sure how that piece of evidence is related to the safe either... Edgeworth: Arrngh... (It's bad enough for Franziska to doubt me, but Detective Gumshoe as well!? I must remain calm, and examine this safe once more for a clue on how to open it!) Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: Doesn't the shape of this keyhole remind you of something, Franziska? Franziska: The shape? It does look very familiar... However, I believe it's simply a latch hole for the safe's lock mechanism. It's just for keeping the door shut, nothing more. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that so? The person who used this safe... ...Mr. Coachen, made sure this safe had two compartments, in order to hide something. Do you honestly think someone like that would allow the keyhole to the hidden half... ...to look so obviously like a keyhole that even the average person could figure it out? Franziska: ! ...You can't be serious...! Are you saying that this hole is the keyhole to the hidden compartment of this safe? Edgeworth: That's precisely what I'm saying. Franziska: ...! Edgeworth: And I will prove to you right now... ...that the Yatagarasu's Key is the key that will open it! Franziska: Franziska: The Yatagarasu's Key!? Miles Edgeworth! This had better be a very bad joke! Edgeworth: Sorry, but this is no joke. The Yatagarasu's Key... ...is the very key that will open the second compartment of this safe. Franziska: We know that this key opens the first compartment of the safe. But the keyhole you're talking about... ...is of an entirely different shape than that of the key! Leads to examination of Yatagarasu's Key Examine button in handle, then blade Leads to: \"Let's go over this again, shall we?\" Edgeworth: Let's go over this again, shall we? The Yatagarasu's Key... ...was originally made to open Mr. Coachen's safe in the Cohdopian Embassy. We confirmed that as fact by opening the door to his safe with it. Now, let's take a look at the back end of the key. Looking at the knife portion head on, what do you see? Franziska: What are you talking... Aaah! Edgeworth: It appears that you've come to understand what I'm talking about. When viewed head-on, the knife's blade is the exact same shape as the keyhole! The real function of the knife portion is to act as the key to the hidden portion of the safe. Franziska: B-But that's... preposterous! Edgeworth: Because it looks like a knife and was used like one to kill Mr. Faraday seven years ago... ...we fell under the misconception that it was always meant to be a knife. But for both the safe and its key to conceal such clever tricks... ...whatever is hidden inside the secret section must be of incredible importance. Franziska: .........Then, it's even possible that what I've been searching for is inside! Scruffy! Hurry up and open that safe! Gumshoe: Eeeek! Y-Yes, sir! Opening it now, sir! Edgeworth: These items... They're...! Gumshoe: It's a bunch of funny-shaped things. I guess they're pieces of art, huh, siiiiir!? Franziska: You're in the way! Now, move, Scruffy! Gumshoe: I didn't think I was in the way... *sniffle* Franziska: These pieces of art...! They're identical to ones that have been stolen from various countries around the world! Edgeworth: I figured as much... These are the treasures this section of the safe was to hide from view! Hmm... I believe a more thorough examination is required. Leads to examination of safe Examine Safe Examine Oddly shaped hole Edgeworth: It appears that we've found the key that the Yatagarasu... ...no, Ms. Yew stole seven years ago. Gumshoe: Since it was originally from this embassy, maybe she came back to return it...? Edgeworth: I don't think she's the type to be so kind as to do such a thing, Detective. Gumshoe: Umm... OK, then what do you think, sir? Edgeworth: (Calisto Yew... For what reason did she steal the key...?) Art pieces Edgeworth: These are pieces of stolen art from around the world... Gumshoe: I wonder how much they're worth? Especially this one... Eeeeeek! Franziska: Scruffy! Don't touch those valuable pieces of art with your filthy hands! Why, do you have any idea what would happen to you if one of them were to break? Edgeworth: (Is it just me, or did she hit one of the pieces of art just now...?) Papers Edgeworth: This is the document that we thought was stuck earlier. I wonder what it's about? Gumshoe: Beats me, sir! Edgeworth: Why don't we take a look at it first before we give up, Detective? Mr. Coachen's name is written here on the last page. (I wonder what the significance of this document is?) Door to second compartment Edgeworth: To build this sort of trick into one's safe is really something... Gumshoe: Yeah, it's neat how this safe has two compartments, but what's really impressive... ...is that at the other end of the key was another key! I totally hadn't noticed! Edgeworth: I wonder if Mr. Coachen was just paranoid or if he had secrets of that great a value. Gumshoe: Speaking of paranoid, I once sharpened both ends of my pencil. But then, when I went to erase something, I got all paranoid that I was gonna stab myself. Edgeworth: Please refrain from dispensing your special brand of unrelated stories while on duty. Gumshoe: Yes, sir... Deduce papers (after clearing \"Smuggling\" Talk option with Franziska von Karma) Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Cohdopian Paper Document Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Take a good look at these documents, Franziska.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I believe this piece of evidence is somehow related. Gumshoe: Oh, I see! That's just like you, sir, to figure these things out! ...But I have no idea what that connection is, so could you explain it to me, please!? Edgeworth: Very well. .............................. (...I'm not sure that I can explain it... I guess it's not related after all.) Gumshoe: Come on, sir! Hurry up and explain it to me! Edgeworth: I will. Eventually. Let's save it for another time when I have the proper time to explain it to you. (I suppose I should carefully examine everything one more time...) Leads to examination of safe Examine evidence Yatagarasu's Key Knife blade Edgeworth: This Yatagarasu's Key was originally made to open the safe... ....in Babahlese Embassy's secretariat's office. And whilst the blade looks like a simple knife at first glance... ...when viewed head-on, it's actually the same shape as the second keyhole in the safe. This key was stolen by the Yatagarasu seven years ago from the Cohdopian Embassy... ...which suggests that this was made while Cohdopia still existed as a country. Partner Notice anything? Gumshoe: I can't believe there's a secret door inside the safe... Guess the stuff inside must be really, really important! Edgeworth: Yes, they appear to be quite important. Gumshoe: The little figures and stuff... I wonder how much those are worth? Edgeworth: Knowing that they are stolen merchandise, I would say they are probably priceless. Their value is probably worth more than what you could ever hope to make in your lifetime. Gumshoe: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? You're kidding right, sir!? I-I mean, they're so small... Edgeworth: (Well, we're talking about purchasing it with YOUR salary, detective, so...) Gumshoe: Ok, then I guess those pieces of paper must be pretty valuable, too, right? Edgeworth: Yes, I assume so. I'm actually quite curious about them. (Even if they are not physically worth much, great care was taken to hide them. Which means they must be very important documents to someone. I wonder if the papers in the safe might be related to that other document...?) Edgeworth: Take a good look at these documents, Franziska. Franziska: It says that there are three pages in total, and yet, there are only two here. Edgeworth: Correct. Now take a look at the smuggling activity document in your possession. Tell me, is it not possible that your page was taken from this set of three? Franziska: Well, well... It certainly looks that way. Edgeworth: By putting our multi-part puzzle together, we seem to have arrived at an answer. And it seems that you have now found what you were looking for. Franziska: Yes, and with this, it has become crystal clear... ...that Mr. Coachen himself was responsible for the mass smuggling of Babahlese ink! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink? Franziska: Babahlese ink is a special product of the Republic of Babahl. However, due to a special reason, only a limited volume is ever exported. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And that reason is...? Franziska: That's classified. It's on a need to know basis, and you don't need to know. In any case, it seems that the head of the smuggling ring was our victim, Mr. Manny Coachen. Edgeworth: His base was in an embassy, thus, it was hard for both our country and his to interfere. Making it the ideal conditions under which to run a smuggling operation. Franziska: Argh... but it's so frustrating. I lost the person I was to rain judgment down upon with my Whip of Justice. Edgeworth: Well, even if he is dead, we still have a responsibility to look into his misdeeds. Franziska: You expect me to whip a dead man? ...Well, I'm not interested. Edgeworth: Franziska... You must know... ...that Manny Coachen was the suspect in the KG-8 Incident... Franziska: Of course I know! On top of being the head of the smuggling ring... ...there is the matter of what really happened in that case that needs to be resolved. Talk Colias Palaeno Present Cohdopian Paper Document Palaeno: I can't believe that Babahlese ink was being used in such an evil scheme... And if people were to find out, that would really tarnish the global image of Babahl. Ah, this is really bad. Really, really bad. Ooh, Babahl's in a bind now... *sigh* Edgeworth: ......... (Is it just me or do his words not match his facial expressions?) Examine Safe Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Papers Edgeworth: The existence of this document in itself is quite important, isn't it? Franziska: Yes, it proves that Manny Coachen was the ringleader of the smuggling operation. Edgeworth: I suppose it does. (It really does look that way, however... ...I don't believe this shows us all that he was up to. And in order to find the truth behind his dealings, we'll need to continue investigating.) After connecting \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\" Logic, and examining golden statue and knife rack: Investigation Complete Shih-na: ...Are you done investigating? Edgeworth: .................. Shih-na: You realize now, don't you? That this girl is the only one it could be. Now come along quietly, Yatagarasu... Kay Faraday. You are under arrest for the murder of Manny Coachen. Kay: M...Mr. Edgeworth! Please, you have to believe me! I didn't do it! I chased the fake Yatagarasu in here... and he... he was already... Shih-na: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'd like to help you reduce the number of mistaken arrests Interpol makes. Shih-na: ...What is that supposed to mean? Edgeworth: I believe I told you that Kay Faraday is not the culprit of this crime. Shih-na: ...Very well. I suppose I have no choice. I'll show you just how foolish your claims are! Testimony -- Why Arrest Kay? -- Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight. Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy. Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu. And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body. Edgeworth: Your reason for suspecting Kay is because you think she is the Yatagarasu? Shih-na: ...Exactly. But it isn't just me. She calls herself the Yatagarasu. Kay: Argh! Look, how many times do I have to tell you!? I was only out to capture the fake Yatagarasu! Shih-na: Imposter or not... it matters not. A Yatagarasu is a Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: Very well. Then I shall prove that Kay is not the Yatagarasu who killed Mr. Manny Coachen! Shih-na: ...Go ahead and try. Show me what the prosecutors of this country are made of. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: They may have confirmed it, but are you telling me that no one could catch the thief? If so, you're basically admitting that the Yatagarasu that committed murder eluded us! Shih-na: ......... Of course, I chased after the Yatagarasu that entered the Babahlese Embassy right away. And that is also why I'm making this arrest right now. Because at the end of my long chase... there was only this girl. Edgeworth: Nnnghoooh! Shih-na: In any case, this is what I believe happened tonight. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The confusion caused by the fire...? Are you saying... that the Yatagarasu was not the arsonist who started the fire? Shih-na: A suspicious person in a long coat was spotted in the area. Officers in the area claim to have seen that person start the fire. Edgeworth: Hmph... It sounds like we have a phantom in our midst. Gumshoe: Umm... Yeah... Edgeworth: (In a way... he could be considered a phantom, with the way he randomly appears.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because she calls herself that, it doesn't prove that she is a killer. Shih-na: No, but it does give her a motive. The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" Furthermore, there are documents pertaining to some smuggling activity in this room. She obviously wanted to steal them... ...so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Edgeworth: I see... (Her logic is very sound. I expected nothing less of Agent Lang's secretary. However, that statement just now didn't sound right. It might just be the opening I need.) Adds statement \"She wanted to steal documents regarding smuggling, so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because she calls herself that, it doesn't prove that she is a killer. Shih-na: No, but it does give her a motive. The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" Furthermore, there are documents pertaining to some smuggling activity in this room. She obviously wanted to steal them... ...so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Edgeworth: I see... (Her logic is very sound. I expected nothing less of Agent Lang's secretary.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you're claiming that Kay knew that a foreign country's embassy had such documents? Shih-na: As stated in the calling card, the Yatagarasu was out to steal a \"dirty secret\"... ...which means that the goal tonight was to steal those smuggling activity documents. Kay: You have it all wrong! It was the fake that sent that card! Shih-na: ...Your words are meaningless. If you are truly innocent, then let's see some proof. Kay: Umm... Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! I leave it to you to handle this! Edgeworth: Yes, I'd rather you did. (The Yatagarasu's goal, huh...) Shih-na: You can claim she's innocent, but you can't change the facts I've already outlined. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I really don't think that being the first to discover the body makes her the killer by default. Shih-na: No, but if you saw the self-purported Yatagarasu standing in front of a body... ...wouldn't you get a little suspicious yourself? Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Even so... I'd still listen to what that person had to say before I passed judgement! Franziska: Hah, are you talking about yourself and those times when you were under suspicion? Edgeworth: I think the pain of being falsely accused is something you really should experience. Gumshoe: I, personally, know that feeling really well, sir! Kay: And given my situation, I now know exactly what it's like, too! Franziska: I'm fine with never experiencing it, ever. Shih-na: ...Are you done with your little group conference? Edgeworth: (So Agent Shih-na suspects Kay of murder simply because Kay is the Yatagarasu. But if I can prove that the Yatagarasu's goal is not related to murder... ...then I may be able to begin to reason with her!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Kay Faraday\nDescription: Young girl purporting to be the 2nd Yatagarasu.

When those which were split are made whole again... ...the truth will reveal itself. I-It's the Yatagarasu! The Yatagarasu's here! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! -- 8 Hours Earlier -- March 14, 10:17 AM High Prosecutors' Offices - Room 1202 Edgeworth: (It's so nice, almost dreamlike, to finally have the chance to relax and sip some tea. Especially after what a whirlwind the past few days have been.) On my return flight, I was dragged into a case involving an Interpol agent's murder. The next day, I investigated a kidnapping and a murder at the Gatewater Land theme park. And later that night, a detective's dead body welcomed me back to my office... ...along with a thief who was out to pilfer files related to a case from 10 years ago. (How did I manage to find myself in the middle of so many cases back to back? Well, at least I have today. All I ask is that I be allowed to spend it quietly.) ???: Mr. Edgewooooorth! This is big! Big, I tell you! ...Hey, what's wrong with you? Where's your enthusiasm...? Edgeworth: And suddenly, the phrase \"the fragility of dreams\" comes to mind... Kay: What are you talking about, \"fragile dreams\"!? Come on, let's go! The fake Yatagarasu isn't going to just find herself, you know! Edgeworth: Well, if you must know... it's possible that I was paid a visit last night by your \"fake\". Kay: Say what? Edgeworth: ......... Edgeworth: Unfortunately for us, the thief managed to escape. But even now, we're still looking for this criminal. However, I must warn you that we've only had a few hours to search so far... ...so I must insist that you be patient on this one, Kay. Kay: Wh-What's with you today...? Are you sure you aren't sleep-talking to me right now? Anyway, I've got something much more important that I want you to see! Edgeworth: Oh, and that is? Kay: Take a look at this! Edgeworth: \"On March 14th, I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" That's quite a bold declaration to send to an embassy... (I suppose it was inevitable that a newspaper would catch wind of this.) Kay: The date the card mentions is today! Edgeworth: Today, huh... Kay: Come on, we've gotta hurry! The embassy awaits! Edgeworth: I suppose it IS quite an urgent matter... ...however, do you know which country's embassy we should be investigating? Kay: Well, it's some really special country, and I'm actually really fuzzy on the details... But never mind that! Where's all your energy!? Why are you so lackadaisical today!? Edgeworth: I'm not, Kay. You're just too wound up. Kay: Well, then you should get too wound up, too! Because this just might be our chance to catch that woman! Edgeworth: You mean Ms. Yew? (The woman who killed Kay's father, Byrne Faraday, seven years ago... Calisto Yew... She claimed to be the Great Thief Yatagarasu... ...and then disappeared from the courtroom.) Kay: Argh! She makes me so mad! The phony! Everyone knows that the real Yatagarasu would never send something like a calling card! Until a company's underhanded dealings are made public... ...the target is always totally unaware that the Yatagarasu has paid them a visit. That's what makes the real Yatagarasu so awesome! Edgeworth: Hmm... The Yatagarasu's card that's shown in this article... It looks to me as though it could be genuine. Kay: See, that's the thing. Whoever it is, that person isn't the real deal, but has knowledge of the Yatagarasu. If this isn't a clue that that woman's involved, then nothing is! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Out the door you go! Edgeworth: Wait, there are a few preparations I must make before we go... (There's something interesting about this card we found last night here in my office... It's of a different color than the one in the article, which makes me wonder why.) Kay: What's up? Any reason why you're boring a hole through the newspaper with your eyes? Edgeworth: No... No reason at all. Very well. Seeing as how Ms. Yew is also someone of a special nature to me... ...I agree there is some merit to be found in investigating this. Kay: I knew you'd come around! March 14, 5:00 PM Theatrum Neutralis ???: By the light of this night's glorious moon... We are ready! Pink Princess: Ready to embark on our nightly outing. Steel Samurai: And this is where... ...our tale begins! Edgeworth: Heh... What a coincidence. Who would've thought that a Steel Samurai stage show... ...would ever be held at such an elegant theater inside a foreign embassy? Examine evidence Prosecutor's Badge Front of badge Edgeworth: This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so. Back of badge Edgeworth: Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else! Kay: Yeah! The climax was really awesome! \"Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\" I got chills down my spine when he pulled that move out! Edgeworth: I suppose it really is more impactful to watch a show in person than on television. Kay: I have to say, though, this embassy is set up kinda funny. I mean, they have two countries sharing the same building! Edgeworth: Well, as you said yourself, this place and the countries it houses are very special. Even this theater is special in that it is a neutral zone shared by the two countries. Kay: Umm... So, let me get this straight... The Steel Samurai show just now is being sponsored by one of the two countries. The one that's called the Kingdom of Allebahst, right? Edgeworth: Yes, it would appear that the Steel Samurai is very popular in that country as well. Kay: Seems that way! But you know who I'M really into? The Jammin' Ninja! The Republic of Babahl is sponsoring a Jammin' Ninja stage show! That's something for fangirls like me! We've totally gotta see that too, Mr. Edgeworth! The Jammin' Ninja's show is gonna kick the Steel Samurai show's rear end! Edgeworth: (You know, ever since I first met this girl, I've always had this inkling... ...that what she really wants to be... ...is not a thief, but rather, a ninja...) Kay: So anyway, about today's event... umm... What's it called again? Edgeworth: \"The Kingdom of Allebahst versus The Republic of Babahl Goodwill Jubilee\". The small, European countries of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...and the Republic of Babahl. These two countries used to be a single entity that was abundant with nature. And it was called... the Principality of Cohdopia. .................. Kay: Hm? Is everything alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Yes, I'm alright. Moving on... After a period of civil unrest, the country split in two, though signs of their past remain. For example, their flags preserve the flower and butterfly motifs to this day. ......... (Cohdopia, huh... The KG-8 Incident... and what was referred to as the second KG-8 Incident... ...in which an Embassy staff member was murdered... Both of these cases were related to the Principality of Cohdopia. In the seven years that have passed, the country may have split into two... ...however, the Yatagarasu still sent a calling card here. What could it all mean?) ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I know you're thinking about something! Edgeworth: Oh, excuse me. What were we talking about again? Kay: Argh, if you could please stop spacing out on me! Anyway, we were talking about the Allebahst versus Babahl Goodwill Jubilee. The two countries have had a pretty bad relationship with each other... ...but supposedly, they've been trying really hard to make up recently. That's why they decided to hold this event. Edgeworth: (If that's the case, then why the \"versus\"...?) Kay: Also, both countries claim to own the real \"Primidux Statue\", a national treasure to both. They're planning to have them publicly evaluated today, to see which one's the real deal. Edgeworth: Kay, need I remind you to take care and not succumb to your thieving desires? Kay: Well, when it comes to treasure, I can't help myself. You know that! Edgeworth: (Nngh... She had better be saying that in jest...) Kay: Hey! I can read your body language, you know! And you've got it all wrong! Look! I'm here to do some investigating! INVESTIGATING, I tell you! Edgeworth: Heh, I know. And although we don't know if the Yatagarasu will really make an appearance... ...I suppose we should still spend some time examining this place. Talk Guard by left door Guard: Is there something I can help you with? Edgeworth: I was wondering what is beyond these doors. Guard: It's the Allebahstian Embassy. Now, unless you have some business with the Embassy... Edgeworth: (I suppose I can't really claim to have any business with the Embassy right now.) Kay: Well, you don't have to be so rude about it, Mr. Guard! Hrmph! Man in blue suit Man: Ten more minutes... No, in five more minutes... But isn't it really bad for me to spend time doing this? It's no use! Would someone please just tell me what I should do! Edgeworth: You appear to be troubled by something. May I be of any assistance? Man: Leave me alone! I'm trying to figure out just the right time to talk to that girl over there! And if I mess up, it'll be because I'm talking to you right now! Kay: Somehow, I get the feeling he's about to fall flat on his face. Edgeworth: Well, let's just do as he wishes and leave him alone. Girls by pamphlets Fan: You know, I've seen a lot of these shows in a bunch of other places... ...but today's show, it was like they went for a complete comedy, know what I mean? Friend: Yeah, And that last move, the Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Sushi Slice] in the original release)... I couldn't help but laugh! Fan: I know, right!? And that Pink Princess's movements were really stiff. In the middle of the show, I could swear that I heard her hip crack. Friend: Oh, I know! I totally thought that, too! The Pink Princess has a bad hip!? Seriously!? Just what were they thinking, you know!? Edgeworth: (I suppose there is no graceful way to enter this conversation...) Man in green suit Man: This is... the perfect angle! Edgeworth: ? Man: Go, my image! Travel across the wave world and into every TV set around the globe! Edgeworth: (A more honest approach to appearing on TV might serve your ambitions better...) Reporter Reporter: And we're here, reporting live from the Theatrum Neutralis. As you can see, tonight's audience is full of enthusiasm! Let's see what this member of the audience has to say. Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Cameraman: OK, that was good. Let's do one more run-through! Edgeworth: Excuse me, but when you are ready to film for real, would you mind giving me a call...? (I sense that she didn't hear a single world I just said.) Cameraman Cameraman: OK, OK, that's good. Alright, now give me a dramatic \"slam!\" right there! Stop! Stoooop! Hey, do you mind!? Get out of the way, buddy. OK, once more! In 3, 2, 1, action! Edgeworth: Kay, was that my fault just now? Kay: Well, he's obviously working... I guess we should leave him alone. Boy by TV Edgeworth: (It appears that the child is watching a video from the first season of the Steel Samurai.) Child: ♪Go! Go! Keep on fighting, until your last breath!♪ ♪Go, my hero, the Steel Samurai!♪ Edgeworth: (Completely absorbed in singing the theme song, I see... I'll let the child watch in peace.) Camerawoman (Lotta Hart) Cameraman: Where in tarnation are they!? Come on, big scoop! Hey, mister! Outta the way! Yeah, I'm talkin' to ya! Edgeworth: Nngh... (I seem to remember this woman from somewhere... ...yet my instincts are directing me not to engage in conversation with her. Perhaps it would be best if I left her alone.) Guard by right door Guard: Is there something I can help you with? Edgeworth: I was wondering what is beyond these doors. Guard: The Babahlese Embassy is just beyond these doors, sir. Do you have some business with the Embassy? Do you require immediate access? Edgeworth: Ah, no, that's quite alright. Guard: Are you sure, sir? Anyone and everyone is always welcome in the Republic of Babahl! Kay: Well, then! Since we're here! Edgeworth: An embassy isn't some sort of theme park, Kay. Kay: Tch! You're such a buzz kill! Examine Pamphlets Edgeworth: There are pamphlets about the two embassies here on this table. Kay: Hmm... It still looks weird to me. Edgeworth: The country split into two a few years back. And they've shared the building and its grounds 50-50 ever since. Kay: Oh? I guess it's because they don't have the money to build two separate ones, huh? Edgeworth: I-I should think that's not the reason why, Kay. Flag by left door Edgeworth: The national flag of the Kingdom of Allebahst is on display here. The crest on it features a flower. Kay: Flowers and butterflies are kind of rare motifs for flags, don't you think? Edgeworth: Well, when they used to be Cohdopia, the government used to take pride in its land. The citizens also loved the rich, bountiful nature all around them, thus the design. Kay: Hey, if the Steel Samurai got popular enough, do you think they'd put him on their flag? Edgeworth: Are you in your right mind, Kay? Kay: Hmm... Or maybe the Jammin' Ninja would make a better candidate...? Edgeworth: (Hah, don't make me laugh (changed from [Heh, don't make me laugh, Kay] in the original release). Only the Steel Samurai deserves such an honor.) Flowers on left side Kay: Those are some nice flowers! I wonder who they're from? \"Gatewater Imperial Hotel\"? Where's this, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Ah, it's an ultra-luxurious hotel that sponsors the Steel Samurai series. I've been there once to investigate a case. Kay: Oh? So what kind of case was it? Edgeworth: I believe it was related to the Nickel Samurai and the Jammin' Ninja... Kay: Oh, I remember reading about that! You must be the head of Steel Samurai affairs down at the Prosecutor's Office, huh? Edgeworth: (I should think that even you can figure that such an office does not exist, Kay.) TV Edgeworth: There is a flat-panel, a tape deck, and a row of Steel Samurai videos on this table. I suppose it's so visitors can watch an episode or two at their leisure. Kay: I guess it really is just that popular, huh? Edgeworth: Yes, although I never thought I would see it reach this level of popularity... Kay: I wonder why they decided to call on the Steel Samurai for an event like this? I mean, it's like they intended to cut the two countries apart with the Samurai Sword instead! Edgeworth: (Wouldn't that go against the whole point of this event...?) Flowers on right side Edgeworth: These flowers were sent by Global Studios. Kay: Global Studios? Edgeworth: That's where they film the Steel Samurai television show. They have been producing hit after hit recently, so the studio is being remodeled. Kay: Oh! I read about that in the papers the other day! That mascot of theirs is also getting a face-lift, too, right? Umm... what's its name? Edgeworth: You mean Mrs. Monkey? Kay: Yeah, I thought it was something like that! You really have a great memory! Edgeworth: Hah! Never underestimate my powers of recollection. Flag by right door Edgeworth: The national flag of the Republic of Babahl is on display here. The crest on it features a butterfly. Kay: It's really rare to see a national flag featuring an animal on it! Edgeworth: Not really. I can list at least a few off for you that do. Kay: OK, then are there any flags with really chic things on them? Edgeworth: \"Chic\" things? That's pretty vague, Kay... Although, by my definition, there aren't really any flags that feature a \"chic\" object. Kay: Aww, that's too bad. Because if there was, I was thinking about stealing it... Edgeworth: (And what exactly would you do with a stolen national flag, Kay...?) Partner Edgeworth: There's a very festive atmosphere in here. Kay: Yup, super festive! I'm really happy for the Kingdom of Allebahst and the Republic of Babahl. It's great that they have re-established diplomatic relations! The newspapers say that it's almost like they're Cohdopia once again. Edgeworth: Perhaps we are bearing witness to a historic moment in time. Kay: Hey! Look! They're selling some commemorative merchandise to celebrate this event! Founder's Cohdopia Biscuits. And over here, they're selling Royal Cohdopia Biscuits. Edgeworth: ...It would seem that they have yet to reconcile their competitive spirits. After examining pamphlets: Edgeworth: I suppose I'll just help myself to one of these... Embassy Guide stuck into the pages of my Organizer. Edgeworth: (Hm? What is all the hubbub?) Ack! Kay: Hey, look! It's the Steel Samurai! And he's got his son, the Iron Infant, with him!! Talk Steel Samurai Leads to: \"May I speak with you for a second?\" Edgeworth: May I speak with you for a second? (...It's... the Steel Samurai...) Steel Samurai: ......... Edgeworth: ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! What are you glaring at him for!? Edgeworth: Ahem, please excuse me. It's just that I've never seen a super-hero up close before. Steel Samurai: ......... Kay: It looks like he's written something down for you! Edgeworth: \"To Edgeworth, From Steel Samurai Daddy: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo\" Kay: Wow, an autograph! Pretty cool that you got one, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Heh... Steel Samurai's Autograph received. Guard: Mr. Steel Samurai! Ambassador Alba is waiting for you! Reporter: And now the Steel Samurai... ...will proceed to enter the Kingdom of Allebahst to shake the hand of the ambassador. The Steel Samurai isn't only here for the two countries tonight... ...but rather, can be thought of as a goodwill ambassador from our own country as well! Kay: There he goes. Off to spread goodwill to the world. Edgeworth: He really does seem like a goodwill ambassador, doesn't he? Cameraman: OK! We're shooting the next segment now! Cue camera! Reporter: In just a few seconds, the Jammin' Ninja stage show is set to begin. After the show, the Jammin' Ninja will enter the Republic of Babahl. He is set to meet with the Ambassador of Babahl at that time. Kay: AHH! The Jammin' Ninja's show is about to start! We've gotta get back to our seats! Edgeworth: Regrettably... I don't have much of an interest in ninjas... Kay: Well, this show will change your mind! Come on, we have to hurry! If we miss even a second of the Jammin' Ninja's awesome playing, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I suppose you're not about to give me much of a choice here, are you, Kay?) Kay: Ahhh! I could listen to that \"A Ninja Marked for Death's Lullaby\" song all day! His superb playing and that sad melody really brought a tear to my eye! And his heart-wrenching voice! Now THAT'S the Jammin' Ninja's greatest weapon! Edgeworth: .................. Kay: Ahh! Those pieces of Jammin' Ninja merchandise over there! I've got to have them! I especially want the hair sticks they're selling exclusively at these shows. They're exactly like the ones the heroine, Princess Misola, wears in her hair! Edgeworth: ...Anyway. Kay: Anyway!? ANYWAY!? Hold it right there, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: You're thinking of going home, aren't you!? Edgeworth: Well, it doesn't seem likely that the Yatagarasu will be making an appearance tonight. Most likely, it was simply a prank. Kay: No way! I just know the Yatagarasu will show! Edgeworth: But I thought you said that the Yatagarasu doesn't send calling cards. Kay: Yeah, I did, but... Edgeworth: I figured from the very beginning that this would wind up being a wild goose chase. Kay: But that card she sent was a genuine fake calling card! Edgeworth: A genuine fake...? Kay: Well, how can I word this...? The Yatagarasu's mark that's on the calling card is exactly the same as my mark. Get it now? Officer: W-We've got a problem! Th-The Yatagarasu has been spotted in Allebahst! Edgeworth: What!? Kay: You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Hah! So you finally decided to show yourself, you phony! Hey, what gives!? Guard: I'm sorry but I will need to search you before you may enter. Kay: What the!? Hey! The Steel Samurai just waltzed straight on through without one! Now if you don't hurry up and let me through, my phony is going to escape! Edgeworth: Kay, a country's embassy is considered to be a part of the country itself. If you don't go through the proper procedures to enter the country... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm going to enter through Babahl and climb over the wall into Allebahst! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You would tell a prosecutor straight out that you intend to illegally enter another... Kay, are you listening to me!? Kay: Kay Faraday, and I'm coming through! Guard: Yes, and welcome! Edgeworth: Someone stop her! Anyone! March 14, 6:12 PM Open-Air Stage Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay... Where are you? Don't tell me you really did find some way over this fence... Ack! Guard: Fire! This is too big for us to handle! Looks like the Yatagarasu came to Babahl, too! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! You had better be alright, wherever you are! March 14, 6:45 PM Babahlese Embassy - Secretariat's Office Kay: I told you! It wasn't me! Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay! Are you alright!? Kay: Do I look alright to you!? Now, can you do something about this woman!? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe! What is the meaning of this!? Gumshoe: *sigh* Well, sir... it's um, this. Edgeworth: He's...! Kay: It wasn't me! He was already dead when I ran in here, hot on the heels of the fake Yatagarasu! Look, I only came in here because I saw a suspicious person at the open-air stage! Edgeworth: A suspicious person? Kay: A long, black coat and a hood over their head -- I dare you to tell me that's not suspicious! When I saw that person, I immediately thought that they must be the fake Yatagarasu. So I chased after them into the Embassy, then into here, and then lost sight of them... But I just KNOW that person is the one who did it! Shih-na: What are you so worked up over? There is no reason for you to be this loud. Edgeworth: Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're Agent Lang's secretary... ...Shih-na, I believe your name is, correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: And if you are making an arrest... ...I assume you have evidence that it was Kay who committed the crime, is that also correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: You refuse to answer!? Shih-na: I don't need to answer. Edgeworth: ! Shih-na: You are merely a prosecutor in this country, meaning you have no investigative authority. Gumshoe: H-Hey, pal! Just what the heck does what you just said mean!? If it happened here, it's under Mr. Edgeworth's jurisdiction. The end. And seeing as how this building is sitting on our soil, we can investigate wherever we'd like! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, Detective, embassies are a different matter. Gumshoe: Huh? Edgeworth: This office is considered to be a part of the Republic of Babahl. Which means that anything that happens in here... ...defaults to the control of the Babahlese government and Babahlese law... ...giving them exclusive extraterritorial rights. Gumshoe: Extraterrestrial (changed from [Extraterristrial] in the original release, correcting the typo) rights? Sir, do you really believe that the truth is out there!? Edgeworth: *sigh* Basically, our country's laws do not apply inside the embassy of another country. That's what was agreed to by our respective governments. Our authority to investigate was effectively nullified the second we entered this place. Which means we can do little here in this situation... Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! Shih-na: Please leave this matter in Interpol's hands and go home. Edgeworth: N...Nnnnngh... Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Kay: H-Hey, you're not...!? Mr. Edgeworth! ???: ???: In that case... allow me to join your investigation. Gumshoe: M-Ms. von Karma! Eeek! Franziska: Ambassador Palaeno, I truly appreciate you allowing me to join the investigation. Palaeno: It's really nothing. Manny was my secretariat, so of course I want to help you as much as I can. In fact, it's a blessing that Interpol agents were able to make it so quickly. Edgeworth: Franziska... Franziska: Well, well. I never imagined that I'd meet you here of all places. This is an embassy, meaning that you have no authority to conduct... Edgeworth: Franziska: A-Already!? What is it!? Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Hm? And you are? Edgeworth: I'm Miles Edgeworth, public prosecutor. I ask that you please allow me to investigate this case as Ms. von Karma's assistant. Gumshoe: A...Assistant? Franziska: Miles!? What the heck do you think you're...!? Edgeworth: Please, I implore you, Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Very well. I'll be counting on the two of you, Ms. von Karma and Mr. Edgeworth. Gumshoe: Umm... What did you mean by you'll be Ms. von Karma's assistant...? Edgeworth: I don't exactly have a choice, do I, Detective? If I don't become Franziska's assistant, I can't participate in this investigation. Franziska: Hmph. There you go again, running at the mouth with that aloof expression on your face. Edgeworth: Franziska, please... Franziska: I don't know what you're planning quite yet... ...but at least I do know one thing -- that you are now my subordinate. Just remember that my whip is always ready to wake you, should you have a brain lapse. Edgeworth: Of course. I'll keep that in mind. Shih-na: ...If you are done playing games...! Edgeworth: Right. let's begin the investigation. Begin Investigation Babahlese Embassy - Secretariat's Office Edgeworth: By the way, Detective... I suppose it's a bit late to be asking, but why are you here? Gumshoe: Well, better late than never, I guess, sir. I was placed on guard duty for the Babahlese Embassy today! Edgeworth: And why are our police guarding an embassy? Gumshoe: Well, on account of the card they got from the Yatagarasu... ...they called us up and asked for our help, sir. Oh, and because we've been searching for the Yatagarasu these past seven years! It was a more or less mutually beneficial arrangement, if you ask me! Edgeworth: Except for how mutually unbeneficial this has all turned out to be, I suppose. It looks like you failed to competently perform your guard duty yet again. Gumshoe: Ack...! Edgeworth: Look forward to your next salary negotiation... although, it's out of my hands. Gumshoe: But sir! If it gets cut any more, I won't be able to buy even instant (changed from [packet] in the original release) noodles anymore... Talk Franziska von Karma Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What is it? Franziska: Let me tell you something. You are currently my subordinate. And if you wish to convince everyone else of that, you will speak to me with respect! Edgeworth: (What's with the giddy glint in her eyes?) I don't think that will really be necessary, Franziska. Franziska: Oh, really? Well, it doesn't matter. It doesn't change the fact that you are still under me. Edgeworth: (I thought Franziska was flying around the world in pursuit of the smuggling case. So then, why is she here at this embassy (Franziska's return - Why is she here when she is supposed to be overseas in pursuit of a smuggling ring?)...?) Talk The murder Franziska: I was investigating at the Allebahstian Embassy when I got wind of this mess. Edgeworth: Ah, that's right. The Yatagarasu was due to appear at that embassy as well. Franziska: Yes, but the difference is that we didn't have a fire over there. Although, there was an incident at the Allebahstian Embassy as well... But I left Agent Lang in charge of that case and came over to the Babahlese Embassy. Edgeworth: Ah... So Agent Lang is here as well, huh? Franziska: I see you've met. Well, he's in the Allebahstian Embassy acting as body guard for Ambassador Alba. ...However, he seems to have a different reason for being there. Yatagarasu (appears after \"The murder\") Franziska: So the suspect in the murder that occurred in this office is that little girl, I see. Is she, perhaps, trying to be the Yatagarasu? Gumshoe: K-Kay would never harm a soul, sir! Franziska: ...Kay? Edgeworth: You remember, do you not? About the case we investigated together seven years ago? That girl is the daughter of the victim in that case, Mr. Faraday. Franziska: ! So she's that feisty little girl... Edgeworth: Kay has been on the trail of the Yatagarasu, which is how she ended up here... ...looking for the one who took her father's life. Franziska: ...I see. Gumshoe: Kay's trying so hard, but you know what!? The Yatagarasu just keeps on tricking us all! Edgeworth: Hm...? How so? Gumshoe: The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret (Stealing of secret - The card warned that the Yatagarasu will steal the embassy's 'dirtiest secret'.)\"... ...but all we've had is an arson and a murder! The lab boys are going in circles! You know what this is, sirs!? It's a breach of contract, and it's going on the rap sheet! Franziska: If you ask me, I'm perfectly fine with the fact that nothing was stolen tonight. Edgeworth: (I do wonder, though, if Calisto Yew really is the Yatagarasu...) Smuggling (appears after connecting \"Stealing of secret\" and \"Franziska's return\" Logic) Edgeworth: Franziska, when we last talked, you said that you were on the trail of a smuggling ring. I suppose the reason you are here right now is related to that? Franziska: ...Yes. After analyzing the intel we've gathered from various countries... ...this embassy... rose to the top of our list of sites to investigate. And this is what tipped us off. Edgeworth: This accounting document...? Franziska: It's only one page of the whole thing, so we're not sure about all the details... ...however, it's enough for us to grab onto the tail of the beast. For you see... this type of paper was made only in the Principality (changed from [Kingdom] in the original release) of Cohdopia. Which means that somewhere in the countries of Allebahst and Babahl is the head! The one pulling the strings behind the entire smuggling ring! Edgeworth: (That's Franziska for you... She's amazing -- pursuing this case with all she has.) Cohdopian Paper Document data jotted down in my Organizer. Smuggling (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Franziska, when we last talked, you said that you were on the trail of a smuggling ring. I suppose the reason you are here right now is related to that? Franziska: ...Yes. After analyzing the intel we've gathered from various countries... ...this embassy... rose to the top of our list of sites to investigate. And this is what tipped us off. Edgeworth: This accounting document...? Franziska: It's only one page of the whole thing, so we're not sure about all the details... ...however, it's enough for us to grab onto the tail of the beast. For you see... this type of paper was made only in the Principality (changed from [Kingdom] in the original release) of Cohdopia. Which means that somewhere in the countries of Allebahst and Babahl is the head! The one pulling the strings behind the entire smuggling ring! Edgeworth: (That's Franziska for you... She's amazing -- pursuing this case with all she has.) Present Prosecutor's Badge Franziska: What about your Prosecutor's Badge? I have one, too, you know. Edgeworth: Ah, yes... So you do. But seeing as I'm not currently a proper prosecutor, I thought I'd give presenting it a try. Franziska: ............ Is that any way for you to act towards your superior!? Edgeworth: As if threatening a whipping is the proper way of lecturing someone! Notes on Coachen's Body Franziska: It appears that he died of a stab wound. Arngh!! Whoever did this had a lot of nerve! I just can't fathom what could've led the killer to turn a knife against a man! Edgeworth: And I just can't fathom what the prosecutor lashing out with her whip is thinking... Knife or Yatagarasu's Key Franziska: Would you mind not pointing that in my direction? It's dangerous. And anyway, why are you showing it to me? Edgeworth: I have no particular reason... Franziska: !! Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Franziska: If you have no reason! Don't you bring that dangerous object near me! Do you understand!? Edgeworth: ! (I-Is she really that oblivious to the irony in that statement? She lets loose that dangerous whip of hers for no reason all the time!) Cohdopian Paper Document Franziska: We were able to finally obtain this proof of the smuggling operation through Interpol. So remember to take extra care when handling it... my subordinate. Edgeworth: *sigh*... (She's enjoying the power trip of calling me her subordinate just a taaaad too much...) Anything else Edgeworth: Ms. von Karma, what do you think of this piece of evidence? Franziska: Hmph, well, since you asked so nicely as my subordinate, I'll answer you. However, as your superior, I also must make sure that my subordinates grow on the job. Therefore, please gather your own thoughts together first, and then try presenting again. Edgeworth: (A simple, \"I don't have any thoughts about that\" would've sufficed...) Colias Palaeno Palaeno: I can't believe that Manny fell among thieves tonight... Without him, I have no idea what my schedule for tonight is. Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, I believe your schedule tonight will consist of... ...listening to reports from the police. That and only that. I ask you to cooperate not only for your own sake, but for Mr. Coachen's as well. Palaeno: ...You're a rather strong man, aren't you? How fascinating! Here, I know it isn't much, but I'd like you to have these. Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but it would be against my principles to accept a bribe. Palaeno: Oh, no, no. These are simply coupons we distribute to promote Babahl. Remember, we offer a large number of discounts and offers when you visit lovely Babahl! Edgeworth: (Now I remember. The Republic of Babahl is known for its feverish tourism industry...) Talk Manny Coachen Edgeworth: I was wondering if you might tell me a bit about the deceased, Manny Coachen. Palaeno: He was my secretary, and the embassy secretariat, charged with running the whole place. He was an admirable man. His death is a great loss to our country. He was in charge of everything, accounting, printing, taking care of our national treasures... Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but did you say \"printing\"? Palaeno: Our country's primary source of revenue is our tourism industry. So, in order for us to print the necessary pamphlets, flyers, coupons, etcetera... ...we have a printing press here at our embassy. Edgeworth: I see. Please excuse my forwardness, however... ...I feel I should mention that I have the distinct impression that I've met him before. Palaeno: ! Oh, yes... Since you are of the legal profession, I suppose you just might have. After all, Manny was involved in the KG-8 Incident. Edgeworth: Th-The KG-8 Incident!? Palaeno: The defendant who was found innocent in that case was Manny. Edgeworth: So your Mr. Coachen is the same man as the one in that case... Palaeno: It's been 10 years. Manny recovered personally from that case, and dove enthusiastically into this job. He was the one who planned this event, and was to oversee this embassy's renovations. It really is a shame. He had such a bright future ahead of him. Renovations (appears after \"Manny Coachen\") Edgeworth: What exactly did you mean earlier by \"renovations\"? Palaeno: We can't have tourists and visitors to our embassy think we're a poor nation, can we? So renovating the embassy is something of an investment. We may have a rather paltry budget, but we're trying our best to make do (changed from [due] in the original release, correcting the typo). However... ...I guess the only person who could've helped us do our best is now no longer with us. Cohdopia (appears after examining key on body and clearing \"Manny Coachen\" Talk option) Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, I was wondering if I may ask you about Cohdopia. Palaeno: Cohdopia? Alright. What would you like to talk about? Edgeworth: First... I'd like to ask you about this key. Palaeno: Hm? What about this key? Edgeworth: I found it sticking out of Mr. Coachen's pocket. I believe it originally belonged to this embassy. Is that correct? Palaeno: Hmm... Upon closer inspection, it seems that this key is shaped like a butterfly. Edgeworth: That's not all about this key. It's also capable of changing into a knife. Palaeno: Oh! How fascinating! Edgeworth: (Is it possible that the ambassador didn't know about the existence of this key...?) Palaeno: ...Hm? In its knife form, there is a flower mark at the base of the blade. Hmm... I guess this knife might be from when we used to be a part of Cohdopia. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And how did you come to that conclusion? Palaeno: It has both of Cohdopia's national symbols, the butterfly and the flower. I suppose Manny used this key here at the embassy (Key used at Embassy - This key was stolen from the Cohdopian Embassy 7 years ago by the Yatagarasu.) back when we were still Cohdopia. Franziska: Ambassador Palaeno, this key was stolen from the Cohdopian Embassy seven years ago... ...by Calisto Yew, otherwise known as the Great Thief Yatagarasu. Palaeno: ! O-Oh, really? Edgeworth: You were not aware that Ms. Yew had broken into this embassy at that time? Palaeno: I'm sorry I can't be of much help. I'm not very familiar with the details, you see. I only became the ambassador after Babahl became its own independent nation. But if Manny were still alive, he would probably know about what happened back then... Edgeworth: (Mr. Coachen and Ms. Yew knew each other seven years ago... But that doesn't explain why I found the Yatagarasu's Key here in the present.) Present Prosecutor's Badge Palaeno: Oh, is that a Prosecutor's Badge? It has a very cool design! Aha! I know! We should start selling items like this as souvenirs in Babahl! The tourists will absolutely go nuts over them! Edgeworth: (Please don't compare a proud symbol of my profession to a cheap souvenir...) Embassy Guide Palaeno: Oh, isn't that about our great embassy? Ah... How do you like our pamphlets? Edgeworth: I feel indifferent about them, to be honest. I'm just using this as evidence. Palaeno: Oh, that's too bad... In that case, I guess we'll just have to try harder to make more charming ones! ! I-I just had a flash of inspiration! We should make all of our pamphlets into coupon books! Edgeworth: ............ (His expectations of what a coupon can do is just a tad hyper-inflated.) Notes on Coachen's Body or Knife Palaeno: Oh, dear... If people were to find out that a murder occurred at our embassy... ...the number of tourists would plummet, as would our revenues! It'd be a disaster! What are we going to do...? Edgeworth: (He really does seem worried. Perhaps I should refrain from bringing this up...) Babahl's Primidux Statue Palaeno: This statue resembles that hero, the Steel Samurai, don't you think? I was thinking, what would you say to changing its name to the \"Steel Samurai Statue\"? It just might attract a few more tourists to our country if I did, right? Edgeworth: I-I'm not sure what to think... (I thought that thing was a national treasure...) Anything else Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, I was wondering if you might have some thoughts on this. Palaeno: I think that you would know more about the case than I. So let me make it up to you for not knowing anything about that with these coupons! Edgeworth: ...Thank you, however, I feel I must decline. Officer Officer: Sorry, but Interpol is still conducting its investigation beyond this point. Edgeworth: I'm a subordinate of Ms. von Karma. Is there some reason why I'm being denied access? Officer: My superior clearly stated, \"Don't you dare let anyone near the site, you got it!?\" If I let you examine the site, my superior would get really angry at me! Gumshoe: You know, Mr. Edgeworth... I feel really bad for the guy, so why don't we do as he says? Edgeworth: Yes... I suppose we might as well. Shih-na or Kay Faraday Edgeworth: Kay, are you alright? Kay: You believe me, don't you, Mr. Edgeworth? You don't think I did it, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, of course I don't. And I promise to prove that it wasn't you. Shih-na: That's enough chit-chat. You can investigate all you like, but it's only a matter of time before we take her in. It would be wise of you to give up while you can. Edgeworth: No, I don't think so. Kay isn't lying, and my investigation will prove that to be true. Shih-na: Go ahead and try then, if you're that confident. Edgeworth: (I can't allow this to continue on this way. I must prove her innocence post haste!) Examine Fireplace Gumshoe: That's some fireplace! You know, it really gives this place a mansion-like quality, don't you think, sir!? Ooh! If these are a staple in every Babahlese house... ...then I bet Santa Claus pays them a visit, too. Edgeworth: (Just how old are you again, Detective...?) Safe Edgeworth: A small, personal safe... Franziska: This was Mr. Coachen's office. So perhaps he stored his most important documents in here. Edgeworth: Ah, of course it's locked. It appears we won't be able to open it without the key (Locked safe - The secretariat's office safe. It can't be opened without the key.). Body Edgeworth: So our victim... was the secretariat of this embassy, I take it. Franziska: Manny Coachen. I heard that he was an admirable person... very admirable. Edgeworth: The cause of death is a stab to the base of his neck... He was lax in watching his back. Franziska: We were fortunate that the fire missed our victim's body for the most part. If the fire had burned a bit longer, it would've made identifying him a hassle. Edgeworth: (So Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death in the middle of a raging fire...? What in the world happened inside this room?) Notes on Coachen's Body jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Body Edgeworth: (Hm? This man... Where do I know him from...?) Wound Edgeworth: It's a knife wound. Franziska: It's obvious what he was killed with, but I wonder if it's consistent with the wound? Shih-na: Indeed. Knife Edgeworth: Is this knife the murder weapon...!? Shih-na: Some preliminary testing has been conducted. According to the results, the blood on that matches the victim's blood. The blade's shape was also found to be consistent with the stab wound. Edgeworth: I suppose this means that we now know that the crime was committed with this knife. Gumshoe: This knife's got some really fancy ornamentation going on, huh, sir? This thing practically screams \"ARTSY!\" at me, too! Although, it's also covered in blood, just like the last thing that I said was artsy... Franziska: Hmm, but the handle is pristine, there's not a single drop of blood on it. Speaking of the handle... I believe it has a butterfly motif (Motif on knife handle - A butterfly-shaped guard adorns the handle of the murder weapon.). It's very beautiful. Knife data jotted down in my Organizer. Knife (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Is this knife the murder weapon...!? Shih-na: Some preliminary testing has been conducted. According to the results, the blood on that matches the victim's blood. The blade's shape was also found to be consistent with the stab wound. Edgeworth: I suppose this means that we now know that the crime was committed with this knife. Gumshoe: This knife's got some really fancy ornamentation going on, huh, sir? This thing practically screams \"ARTSY!\" at me, too! Although, it's also covered in blood, just like the last thing that I said was artsy... Franziska: Hmm, but the handle is pristine, there's not a single drop of blood on it. Speaking of the handle... I believe it has a butterfly motif. It's very beautiful. Key Edgeworth: Hmm... There appears to be something in his pocket. ! This key! It can't be...! Isn't this the Yatagarasu's Key that was stolen seven years ago!? Franziska: What!? But that's...! Gumshoe: Huh? Seven years ag...oooh! You mean that case where I was framed, sir!? Edgeworth: Yes, it's the piece of evidence that stole the life of Kay's father seven years ago... ...which was then stolen by Calisto Yew. Gumshoe: Wh-What!? Mr. Faraday was killed with this key, sir!? I thought he was killed with a knife... Eeeek! Franziska: Scruffy! At the very least, try to remember the details of crimes you were a suspect in! Edgeworth: Franziska, as you will recall... ...Detective Gumshoe was not present when Ms. Yew made her escape. Plus, even among law enforcement, only a few knew of this key's existence. I doubt that a new rookie at the time would've been made privy to such knowledge. Gumshoe: Ooonnngh... I feel like the victim right now, all trampled on, sir! Edgeworth: Hmph... I suppose I'll just have to fill you in now. The secret to this key is...! Leads to examination of Yatagarasu's Key Examine butterfly=shaped key Edgeworth: It's not that far-fetched to think that the end of this key was meant to be a butterfly. The key maker must've been a true patriot to have fashioned this after the national symbol. Examine button in handle Leads to: \"Ohoooo!\" Gumshoe: Ohoooo! Wow, that's amazing, sir! It's like some kind of magic trick! Yatagarasu's Key data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: I knew it. This is the same exact piece of evidence that Ms. Yew took with her... I remember this beautiful pattern in the blade. Franziska: I remember this as well. It's a vine motif, isn't it? Edgeworth: Yes, it looks like two interwoven vines, crisscrossing down the blade. Gumshoe: Vines, sirs? I think it looks like a bunch of stars, if you ask me. It's one of those six-sided stars, just like the police mark on our IDs! Edgeworth: I... really don't think you can call these stars. (...To say that the detective's art sense is underdeveloped would be an understatement.) Franziska: The real question is why was the Babahlese Embassy's secretariat holding this? Edgeworth: While we don't know how Mr. Coachen came to possess this key... ...we do know that this was stolen by the Yatagarasu from the Cohdopian Embassy. Franziska: That's right. Mr. Faraday had written that fact down in his organizer. Edgeworth: I believe this means that further research is required into the country of Cohdopia. Franziska: Why don't you ask Ambassador Palaeno about what he knows? Supposedly, he was a candidate to be the next Cohdopian ambassador once long ago. He should be able to answer any specific questions you may have. Key (subsequent times) Edgeworth: It's the Yatagarasu's Key... I wonder how it managed to return here? Gumshoe: So this key was stolen by Calisto Yew seven years ago, right? Edgeworth: Yes, although originally, it was stolen from this very building. Gumshoe: Well, then, maybe Ms. Yew just decided to bring it back. Edgeworth: I can't dismiss that possibility, however... (...it doesn't fit her modus operandi, given all of her other actions.) Body (after examining knife and key) Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Butterfly on wall Gumshoe: Heeeey! It's another butterfly! Edgeworth: I believe it is the symbol of the Republic of Babahl (Buttlerfly of Babahl - National symbol that adorns the national flag. Allebahst's flower is its counterpart.). A drawing this big on the wall of an embassy... It definitely conveys a sense of overwhelming patriotism. Gumshoe: Well, I've got a lot of patriotism, too, sir! The reason I became a cop in the first place was because I wanted to protect our country! Edgeworth: You may want to, Detective, however, I have yet to see the fruits of your desire. Gumshoe: Y-You don't have to be so blunt about it, sir! Broken ceiling fan Edgeworth: This ceiling fan must've fallen from the ceiling. Gumshoe: A ceiling fan? What does one of those do? Edgeworth: Exactly what it sounds like it does; it's a fan that is installed on one's ceiling. Gumshoe: Well, if I had one of those in my room, I bet I'd go dizzy from staring at it as I slept. Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. In the real world, we close our eyes when we sleep. Golden statue Palaeno: Because this is a national treasure, can I ask that you please not touch it? I'm afraid the only ones allowed to touch it are myself and the secretariat. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But there is a possibility that it is related to the murder, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Why don't we give up for now? We can force them to let us investigate it later when we find some solid proof! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I don't have a choice here. (This must be one of the Primidux Statues Kay was talking about earlier. ............ Is it just me or does this man look just like the Steel Samurai? They could be twins.) Babahl's Primidux Statue data jotted down in my Organizer. Golden statue (subsequent times) Palaeno: Because this is a national treasure, can I ask that you please not touch it? I'm afraid the only ones allowed to touch it are myself and the secretariat. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But there is a possibility that it is related to the murder, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Why don't we give up for now? We can force them to let us investigate it later when we find some solid proof! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I don't have a choice here. (This must be one of the Primidux Statues Kay was talking about earlier. ............ Is it just me or does this man look just like the Steel Samurai? They could be twins.) Knife rack Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! There's still something on this display rack, sir! Edgeworth: Knives, huh... Although, the blades are all that remain of them, unfortunately. Gumshoe: I guess the handles all got burnt off by the fire. Palaeno: Ah... So even the knives fell victim to the fire... Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, are these knives yours? Palaeno: Why yes, they are. They are a special set of ornamental knives featuring the national symbol of Babahl. These butterfly-themed knives, along with Allebahst's own set of knives... ...are comprised of three knives each. But... But I can't believe the Babahlese ones have been reduced to this state... Edgeworth: Hmm... (Ornamental knives, huh? ...Hm? There's a small release on the tang of this blade.) Ambassador Palaeno, what is this notch here for...? Palaeno: Oh, that! It's a feature of these knives wherein you can freely exchange the handles on them. So that we can change how they look to fit the situation, of course. Edgeworth: I see. So these knives were constructed so that the handles could be easily removed. Shelves Edgeworth: These shelves are lined with American souvenirs and memorabilia. Gumshoe: It's really strange isn't it? I mean, I thought this was the Babahlese Embassy! So, umm, why are there so many American souvenirs, sir? Edgeworth: Perhaps the Babahlese are studying American culture and our tourism industry...? If they have plans to make the Babahlese tourism industry truly flourish... ...then they would need to observe and study other countries' methods, I suppose. Gumshoe: Speaking of tourism, I got these from the blond guy earlier, sir. He said that if I bring these with me to Babahl, I can trade them in for a few buffets! Edgeworth: Oh? So, how do you expect to travel to Babahl? Gumshoe: Well, the whole world is connected by the oceans, sir! And for an all-you-can-eat buffet, I'd swim all the way to Babahl if I have to! Edgeworth: (Can a few simple coupons really motivate people to do such fantastic things?) Burnt objects by clock Edgeworth: There are still some burnt objects scattered on the floor. Gumshoe: Well, burnt things get burnt and then they become burnt things, you know? Edgeworth: No, because there is no way to prove that the burnt thing started out as a burnt thing. Gumshoe: Was it a burnt thing, or was it not? I have no idea what's what anymore, sir... Edgeworth: Yes, I suppose it's a bit hard for someone with a burnt-out light bulb to comprehend. Grandfather clock Edgeworth: It looks like this was once a magnificent grand father [sic] (changed from [grand grandfather] in the original release) clock, but it has fallen victim to the fire. Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! Is it OK for me to talk about the clocks in my house, sir? Edgeworth: If they're unrelated to the case, I hope that you will refrain from sharing, but... Gumshoe: Well, there's this one clock that I made by myself, but the timer on it manages to auto... Edgeworth: That's quite enough, Detective. Examine evidence Knife Blade Edgeworth: So this is what took Mr. Coachen's life. Some of his blood is still on the blade. Gumshoe: Wow, I've been a detective for 7 years already? I've seen a lot of weapons in my days... ...but knives that were used to kill are always the hardest for me to bear. Edgeworth: Yes, unlike guns, this is one weapon where you're likely to find the victim's blood on it. Gumshoe: Yeah, just like how this one is practically drenched in it, huh, sir? Edgeworth: (Despite that, it looks like the blood managed to miss the handle somehow.) Ornate butterfly on handle Edgeworth: There is a lot of skilled detailing on this handle. I believe this is a butterfly. Gumshoe: This is one amazing ornamental knife. And I'm really glad that this beautiful butterfly wasn't ruined by blood. Edgeworth: There is not even a drop of blood on it. It really is quite exquisite. So much so that even you can understand its beauty, Detective. Gumshoe: Hey, why do you always have to look down on my tastes, sir!? I know what I like, and this is really well-crafted! Edgeworth: (Why do I look down on his tastes...? Because, my dear Detective, I'm afraid your tastes are usually quite questionable...) ! This knife... It would appear that the handle is removable. Gumshoe: I guess so people can change them whenever they feel like it. Sounds like fun, sir! Edgeworth: (I don't think people would remove the handle just for fun, Detective...) Yatagarasu's Key Knife blade Edgeworth: There is a vine motif to the ornamentation on this blade. Even if Detective Gumshoe claims to see a star motif in it. Between the blade and handle, there is a flower, and the key itself is a butterfly. This key was stolen by the Yatagarasu seven years ago from the Cohdopian Embassy... ...which suggests that this was made while Cohdopia still existed as a country. Button in handle Edgeworth: We discovered this trick seven years ago, and with it, we were able to corner Ms. Yew. But who would've thought that I'd see this key again after all this time... Butterfly-shaped key Edgeworth: It's not that far-fetched to think that the end of this key was meant to be a butterfly. Logic Connect \"Locked safe\" and \"Key used at Embassy\" Leads to: \"We know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy.\" Connect \"Stealing of secret\" and \"Franziska's return\" Edgeworth: \"To steal your dirtiest secret\"... Is it possible that the \"dirty secret\" the Yatagarasu was out to steal is in this very room? Franziska: \"Dirty secret\"? Edgeworth: Franziska, you're in pursuit of some \"dirty\" underhanded dealings yourself, are you not? Something tells me that this is no coincidence. Franziska: In that case then, the person I'm looking for is here in the Babahlese Embassy, huh? The head of the smuggling operation! Edgeworth: (I think I just might need to ask Franziska about her smuggling case in more depth.) Connect \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\" Edgeworth: The design on the knife's handle... ...it greatly resembles the special Babahlese species of butterfly. Franziska: It does, doesn't it? Plus, it says right here. Edgeworth: \"This knife is property of the Republic of Babahl.\" Perhaps this means that the knife used in the crime was found right in this room...? Partner Gumshoe: Yes, sir? Talk The murder Edgeworth: While you were on guard duty, did you notice anything unusual? Gumshoe: Well, I was on watch inside the Embassy... ...but unfortunately, I didn't run into the Yatagarasu, sir. But I did talk to an officer who was on duty near the border between the two Embassies... ...who told me that not a single person crossed the boundary during the incident. Edgeworth: I see. Gumshoe: The investigations into the fire and the Yatagarasu are a mess thanks to both events! I'm so confused, sir! Should I be putting the fire out or investigating!? What do you think, sir!? Edgeworth: ...Aren't you old enough to solve your own problems yet, Detective? The investigation Edgeworth: I'd like an update on how the investigation is going. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah... Well... it's going, sir! Edgeworth: In other words... ...no one has any idea of what happened here, correct? Gumshoe: To put it simply... yeah, you got it, sir. But! We do know that something happened in this room, sir! Edgeworth: Any moron with a pair of eyes can see what happened, Detective. Gumshoe: Aww... W-Well, anyway! Let's investigate every single nook and cranny in this room, sir! We have to get serious, or Kay will end up getting arrested as the killer! Edgeworth: Yes, I am already well aware of that. Gumshoe: Oh... Edgeworth: (In order to find out what really happened here in this room... ...we will need to gather whatever information we can. It's time to take a good look.) The crime scene (appears after clearing \"Yatagarasu\" Talk option with Franziska von Karma and examining knife near body, key on body, safe, and butterfly on wall) Gumshoe: It looks like all that's left is a bunch of burnt stuff... But, well, I guess we've got all the info we need now, huh, sir? Edgeworth: Yes, it would appear so. Gumshoe: But you know, after all is said and done... ...I still have no idea of what's going on! Nope! Not a clue, sir! I just can't figure it out... Edgeworth: Hmph... Detective Gumshoe. It's nothing to get so worked up over. Gumshoe: Oh! You mean I should use that thing, right!? Umm... Defunction? No, that's not it. Projection? No, no, that's not it either. I think it sounded like... Oh, I've got it! \"Lock it\"! Edgeworth: ...It's \"logic\", Detective. Logic. (Now that I've collected some information, the next step... ...is to connect a few of them together to see if I can make sense of this mess!) Present Prosecutor's Badge Gumshoe: Hey, it's your Prosecutor's Badge! This thing's really important, right? So what would happen if you lost it, sir? Edgeworth: Why are you asking me such an ominous question? Gumshoe: Well, because I've lost my police badge before, sir! I just wanted to tell you to be careful, sir! Because writing the explanation section on those requisition forms is really annoying! Edgeworth: (I believe SOMEONE needs to listen to his own advice a bit more often...) Yatagarasu's Key Gumshoe: Hmm... So this is the Yatagarasu's Key, huh? That's a really nifty trick they built into it. I can't stop playing with it! This is great! It's like one of those transforming toys, sir! Edgeworth: E-Evidence is not meant to entertain, Detective! Anything else Edgeworth: What do you notice about this piece of evidence, Detective? Gumshoe: Umm... Well, uh... I don't really sense anything special about it... But the embassy is a different story! Edgeworth: .........I see. Gumshoe: ...I'm not really sensing anything special from you either, sir... Edgeworth: Well, I'm sensing a special look at your monthly salary, Detective! After connecting \"Locked safe\" and \"Key used at Embassy\" Logic: Edgeworth: We know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy. Furthermore, we found it in the victim, Mr. Coachen's pocket. Which leads me to think that perhaps it is the key to the personal safe in this office. Gumshoe: Good thinking, sir! Let's go try it out! Edgeworth: ...It appears I was correct. (The key that was left to us in the victim's pocket... It literally turned out to be the key to the next piece of the truth!) Hmm... What do we have here? Gumshoe: Hey! There's nothing inside! D-Do you think the Yatagarasu made off with everything, sir? Edgeworth: No, Detective, I believe all we need is a closer look. Leads to examination of safe Examine Safe Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Piece of paper Leads to: \"What is this here?\" Oddly shaped hole Gumshoe: Hey, there's a hole here, sir. Edgeworth: (It's a little too oddly shaped for a latch hole...) Gumshoe: Wow, that's a funny shape for a latch hole, huh? It's shaped kinda... like a star, don't you think, sir!? Edgeworth: Detective, I would hardly call that shape a star... (There must be some reason for this hole...) Gumshoe: Well, there's gotta be some reason why this hole's shaped so weirdly, you know!? Edgeworth: (Am I over thinking this? No, I don't think so...) Gumshoe: Hmm, maybe I'm over thinking things? Nah, there's no way I could ever do that, ho ho! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, could you please be quiet for a second? You're frightening me. Inside of safe Gumshoe: It looks like such a serious safe, but there's not a scrap of paper inside... Which reminds me, the safe in your office is just as empty, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: It's merely a coincidence that both safes are empty, Detective. Gumshoe: Well, make that a triple coincidence because my piggy bank at home is empty, too... Edgeworth: I don't think there's anything coincidental about that, Detective. Edgeworth: What is this here? Gumshoe: It looks like the ripped corner of a piece of paper, sir. Edgeworth: No, I don't think it's ripped; it seems more, to me, like it's stuck in the safe. Gumshoe: Hey, you're right! It won't budge an inch, not even when I tug on it! But I don't think I've ever seen paper stuck on the inside of a safe before... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective, I think you have it backwards. It's not the paper that's strange... It's the safe. Gumshoe: What do you mean? Edgeworth: What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that... it has two compartments. Leads to: \"Even just eye-balling it, you can see that the inside is a bit too shallow.\" it's completely empty. Edgeworth: There is nothing in the safe. Gumshoe: Well, yeah, there's nothing in the safe... but what's that got to do with anything? Edgeworth: Hmph... Why is the safe here in the first place? Gumshoe: Umm... To keep really important things safe, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, precisely. However, there is nothing inside this safe... ...which points us to a clear contradiction of facts! Gumshoe: .........But remember when we checked out your safe that time, and you answered... Edgeworth: Right now? Nothing. Gumshoe: ...when I asked you what was inside? Wouldn't that count as a contradiction, too, then? Edgeworth: Arngh! (I suppose there are times when there just isn't anything that needs to be safeguarded. Alright, time to recollect my thoughts...) Leads back to: \"What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that...\" it has a crack there. Edgeworth: Hmph... It is just as it appears to be. There is a crack in the safe, from where the lodged piece of paper is protruding! Gumshoe: Yeah, that's exactly what it looks like, alright. Edgeworth: Nngh... Franziska: We already know, so there's no reason for you to state the obvious so confidently, Miles. Edgeworth: N...Nngh... Gumshoe: Hey, I feel like I'm a step closer to understanding what it's like to be Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Drat... It appears the only thing I managed to do here is waste time.) Th-That wasn't what I had meant to say! The paper is sticking out, and that in itself is an important fact. So... Leads back to: \"What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that...\" Edgeworth: Even just eye-balling it, you can see that the inside is a bit too shallow. Furthermore, with the unnatural way the paper is stuck at the back of the safe... ...I'd say that there is an extra bit of space behind the back wall of this safe! In other words, this safe has a second compartment. Gumshoe: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? Franziska: I suppose that you are correct in asserting that the paper is stuck in an unnatural manner. However, if what you say is correct and there is a second compartment... ...how do we go about opening the door to it then? As you can see, there is no other lock or keyhole in sight. Edgeworth: Actually, there is one more spot of interest to me on this safe. Franziska: Oh? Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe that spot is the keyhole to our mystery second lock! Franziska: The safe and its locks... Alright then, since you are so sure of yourself, show me how you deduced your answer! Leads to examination of safe Examine Safe Examine Piece of paper Franziska: I suppose that you are correct in asserting that the paper is stuck in an unnatural manner. However, if what you say is correct and there is a second compartment... ...how do we go about opening the door to it then? As you can see, there is no other lock or keyhole in sight. Edgeworth: Actually, there is one more spot of interest to me on this safe. Franziska: Oh? Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe that spot is the keyhole to our mystery second lock! Franziska: Alright then, since you are so sure of yourself, show me how you deduced your answer! Deduce oddly shaped hole Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Yatagarasu's Key Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Doesn't the shape of this keyhole remind you of something, Franziska?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence is the key to the safe! Franziska: I'm not entirely convinced it is... ...but I'm willing to entertain any explanation you may have. Edgeworth: Ack! Gumshoe: Don't worry, sir! I'm sure you're right in what you said! Although... I'm not quite sure how that piece of evidence is related to the safe either... Edgeworth: Arrngh... (It's bad enough for Franziska to doubt me, but Detective Gumshoe as well!? I must remain calm, and examine this safe once more for a clue on how to open it!) Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: Doesn't the shape of this keyhole remind you of something, Franziska? Franziska: The shape? It does look very familiar... However, I believe it's simply a latch hole for the safe's lock mechanism. It's just for keeping the door shut, nothing more. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that so? The person who used this safe... ...Mr. Coachen, made sure this safe had two compartments, in order to hide something. Do you honestly think someone like that would allow the keyhole to the hidden half... ...to look so obviously like a keyhole that even the average person could figure it out? Franziska: ! ...You can't be serious...! Are you saying that this hole is the keyhole to the hidden compartment of this safe? Edgeworth: That's precisely what I'm saying. Franziska: ...! Edgeworth: And I will prove to you right now... ...that the Yatagarasu's Key is the key that will open it! Franziska: Franziska: The Yatagarasu's Key!? Miles Edgeworth! This had better be a very bad joke! Edgeworth: Sorry, but this is no joke. The Yatagarasu's Key... ...is the very key that will open the second compartment of this safe. Franziska: We know that this key opens the first compartment of the safe. But the keyhole you're talking about... ...is of an entirely different shape than that of the key! Leads to examination of Yatagarasu's Key Examine button in handle, then blade Leads to: \"Let's go over this again, shall we?\" Edgeworth: Let's go over this again, shall we? The Yatagarasu's Key... ...was originally made to open Mr. Coachen's safe in the Cohdopian Embassy. We confirmed that as fact by opening the door to his safe with it. Now, let's take a look at the back end of the key. Looking at the knife portion head on, what do you see? Franziska: What are you talking... Aaah! Edgeworth: It appears that you've come to understand what I'm talking about. When viewed head-on, the knife's blade is the exact same shape as the keyhole! The real function of the knife portion is to act as the key to the hidden portion of the safe. Franziska: B-But that's... preposterous! Edgeworth: Because it looks like a knife and was used like one to kill Mr. Faraday seven years ago... ...we fell under the misconception that it was always meant to be a knife. But for both the safe and its key to conceal such clever tricks... ...whatever is hidden inside the secret section must be of incredible importance. Franziska: .........Then, it's even possible that what I've been searching for is inside! Scruffy! Hurry up and open that safe! Gumshoe: Eeeek! Y-Yes, sir! Opening it now, sir! Edgeworth: These items... They're...! Gumshoe: It's a bunch of funny-shaped things. I guess they're pieces of art, huh, siiiiir!? Franziska: You're in the way! Now, move, Scruffy! Gumshoe: I didn't think I was in the way... *sniffle* Franziska: These pieces of art...! They're identical to ones that have been stolen from various countries around the world! Edgeworth: I figured as much... These are the treasures this section of the safe was to hide from view! Hmm... I believe a more thorough examination is required. Leads to examination of safe Examine Safe Examine Oddly shaped hole Edgeworth: It appears that we've found the key that the Yatagarasu... ...no, Ms. Yew stole seven years ago. Gumshoe: Since it was originally from this embassy, maybe she came back to return it...? Edgeworth: I don't think she's the type to be so kind as to do such a thing, Detective. Gumshoe: Umm... OK, then what do you think, sir? Edgeworth: (Calisto Yew... For what reason did she steal the key...?) Art pieces Edgeworth: These are pieces of stolen art from around the world... Gumshoe: I wonder how much they're worth? Especially this one... Eeeeeek! Franziska: Scruffy! Don't touch those valuable pieces of art with your filthy hands! Why, do you have any idea what would happen to you if one of them were to break? Edgeworth: (Is it just me, or did she hit one of the pieces of art just now...?) Papers Edgeworth: This is the document that we thought was stuck earlier. I wonder what it's about? Gumshoe: Beats me, sir! Edgeworth: Why don't we take a look at it first before we give up, Detective? Mr. Coachen's name is written here on the last page. (I wonder what the significance of this document is?) Door to second compartment Edgeworth: To build this sort of trick into one's safe is really something... Gumshoe: Yeah, it's neat how this safe has two compartments, but what's really impressive... ...is that at the other end of the key was another key! I totally hadn't noticed! Edgeworth: I wonder if Mr. Coachen was just paranoid or if he had secrets of that great a value. Gumshoe: Speaking of paranoid, I once sharpened both ends of my pencil. But then, when I went to erase something, I got all paranoid that I was gonna stab myself. Edgeworth: Please refrain from dispensing your special brand of unrelated stories while on duty. Gumshoe: Yes, sir... Deduce papers (after clearing \"Smuggling\" Talk option with Franziska von Karma) Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Cohdopian Paper Document Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Take a good look at these documents, Franziska.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I believe this piece of evidence is somehow related. Gumshoe: Oh, I see! That's just like you, sir, to figure these things out! ...But I have no idea what that connection is, so could you explain it to me, please!? Edgeworth: Very well. .............................. (...I'm not sure that I can explain it... I guess it's not related after all.) Gumshoe: Come on, sir! Hurry up and explain it to me! Edgeworth: I will. Eventually. Let's save it for another time when I have the proper time to explain it to you. (I suppose I should carefully examine everything one more time...) Leads to examination of safe Examine evidence Yatagarasu's Key Knife blade Edgeworth: This Yatagarasu's Key was originally made to open the safe... ....in Babahlese Embassy's secretariat's office. And whilst the blade looks like a simple knife at first glance... ...when viewed head-on, it's actually the same shape as the second keyhole in the safe. This key was stolen by the Yatagarasu seven years ago from the Cohdopian Embassy... ...which suggests that this was made while Cohdopia still existed as a country. Partner Notice anything? Gumshoe: I can't believe there's a secret door inside the safe... Guess the stuff inside must be really, really important! Edgeworth: Yes, they appear to be quite important. Gumshoe: The little figures and stuff... I wonder how much those are worth? Edgeworth: Knowing that they are stolen merchandise, I would say they are probably priceless. Their value is probably worth more than what you could ever hope to make in your lifetime. Gumshoe: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? You're kidding right, sir!? I-I mean, they're so small... Edgeworth: (Well, we're talking about purchasing it with YOUR salary, detective, so...) Gumshoe: Ok, then I guess those pieces of paper must be pretty valuable, too, right? Edgeworth: Yes, I assume so. I'm actually quite curious about them. (Even if they are not physically worth much, great care was taken to hide them. Which means they must be very important documents to someone. I wonder if the papers in the safe might be related to that other document...?) Edgeworth: Take a good look at these documents, Franziska. Franziska: It says that there are three pages in total, and yet, there are only two here. Edgeworth: Correct. Now take a look at the smuggling activity document in your possession. Tell me, is it not possible that your page was taken from this set of three? Franziska: Well, well... It certainly looks that way. Edgeworth: By putting our multi-part puzzle together, we seem to have arrived at an answer. And it seems that you have now found what you were looking for. Franziska: Yes, and with this, it has become crystal clear... ...that Mr. Coachen himself was responsible for the mass smuggling of Babahlese ink! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink? Franziska: Babahlese ink is a special product of the Republic of Babahl. However, due to a special reason, only a limited volume is ever exported. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And that reason is...? Franziska: That's classified. It's on a need to know basis, and you don't need to know. In any case, it seems that the head of the smuggling ring was our victim, Mr. Manny Coachen. Edgeworth: His base was in an embassy, thus, it was hard for both our country and his to interfere. Making it the ideal conditions under which to run a smuggling operation. Franziska: Argh... but it's so frustrating. I lost the person I was to rain judgment down upon with my Whip of Justice. Edgeworth: Well, even if he is dead, we still have a responsibility to look into his misdeeds. Franziska: You expect me to whip a dead man? ...Well, I'm not interested. Edgeworth: Franziska... You must know... ...that Manny Coachen was the suspect in the KG-8 Incident... Franziska: Of course I know! On top of being the head of the smuggling ring... ...there is the matter of what really happened in that case that needs to be resolved. Talk Colias Palaeno Present Cohdopian Paper Document Palaeno: I can't believe that Babahlese ink was being used in such an evil scheme... And if people were to find out, that would really tarnish the global image of Babahl. Ah, this is really bad. Really, really bad. Ooh, Babahl's in a bind now... *sigh* Edgeworth: ......... (Is it just me or do his words not match his facial expressions?) Examine Safe Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Papers Edgeworth: The existence of this document in itself is quite important, isn't it? Franziska: Yes, it proves that Manny Coachen was the ringleader of the smuggling operation. Edgeworth: I suppose it does. (It really does look that way, however... ...I don't believe this shows us all that he was up to. And in order to find the truth behind his dealings, we'll need to continue investigating.) After connecting \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\" Logic, and examining golden statue and knife rack: Investigation Complete Shih-na: ...Are you done investigating? Edgeworth: .................. Shih-na: You realize now, don't you? That this girl is the only one it could be. Now come along quietly, Yatagarasu... Kay Faraday. You are under arrest for the murder of Manny Coachen. Kay: M...Mr. Edgeworth! Please, you have to believe me! I didn't do it! I chased the fake Yatagarasu in here... and he... he was already... Shih-na: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'd like to help you reduce the number of mistaken arrests Interpol makes. Shih-na: ...What is that supposed to mean? Edgeworth: I believe I told you that Kay Faraday is not the culprit of this crime. Shih-na: ...Very well. I suppose I have no choice. I'll show you just how foolish your claims are! Testimony -- Why Arrest Kay? -- Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight. Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy. Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu. And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body. Edgeworth: Your reason for suspecting Kay is because you think she is the Yatagarasu? Shih-na: ...Exactly. But it isn't just me. She calls herself the Yatagarasu. Kay: Argh! Look, how many times do I have to tell you!? I was only out to capture the fake Yatagarasu! Shih-na: Imposter or not... it matters not. A Yatagarasu is a Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: Very well. Then I shall prove that Kay is not the Yatagarasu who killed Mr. Manny Coachen! Shih-na: ...Go ahead and try. Show me what the prosecutors of this country are made of. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: They may have confirmed it, but are you telling me that no one could catch the thief? If so, you're basically admitting that the Yatagarasu that committed murder eluded us! Shih-na: ......... Of course, I chased after the Yatagarasu that entered the Babahlese Embassy right away. And that is also why I'm making this arrest right now. Because at the end of my long chase... there was only this girl. Edgeworth: Nnnghoooh! Shih-na: In any case, this is what I believe happened tonight. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The confusion caused by the fire...? Are you saying... that the Yatagarasu was not the arsonist who started the fire? Shih-na: A suspicious person in a long coat was spotted in the area. Officers in the area claim to have seen that person start the fire. Edgeworth: Hmph... It sounds like we have a phantom in our midst. Gumshoe: Umm... Yeah... Edgeworth: (In a way... he could be considered a phantom, with the way he randomly appears.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because she calls herself that, it doesn't prove that she is a killer. Shih-na: No, but it does give her a motive. The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" Furthermore, there are documents pertaining to some smuggling activity in this room. She obviously wanted to steal them... ...so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Edgeworth: I see... (Her logic is very sound. I expected nothing less of Agent Lang's secretary. However, that statement just now didn't sound right. It might just be the opening I need.) Adds statement \"She wanted to steal documents regarding smuggling, so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because she calls herself that, it doesn't prove that she is a killer.

She obviously wanted to steal them... ...so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Edgeworth: I see... (Her logic is very sound. I expected nothing less of Agent Lang's secretary.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you're claiming that Kay knew that a foreign country's embassy had such documents? Shih-na: As stated in the calling card, the Yatagarasu was out to steal a \"dirty secret\"... ...which means that the goal tonight was to steal those smuggling activity documents. Kay: You have it all wrong! It was the fake that sent that card! Shih-na: ...Your words are meaningless. If you are truly innocent, then let's see some proof. Kay: Umm... Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! I leave it to you to handle this! Edgeworth: Yes, I'd rather you did. (The Yatagarasu's goal, huh...) Shih-na: You can claim she's innocent, but you can't change the facts I've already outlined. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I really don't think that being the first to discover the body makes her the killer by default. Shih-na: No, but if you saw the self-purported Yatagarasu standing in front of a body... ...wouldn't you get a little suspicious yourself? Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Even so... I'd still listen to what that person had to say before I passed judgement! Franziska: Hah, are you talking about yourself and those times when you were under suspicion? Edgeworth: I think the pain of being falsely accused is something you really should experience. Gumshoe: I, personally, know that feeling really well, sir! Kay: And given my situation, I now know exactly what it's like, too! Franziska: I'm fine with never experiencing it, ever. Shih-na: ...Are you done with your little group conference? Edgeworth: (So Agent Shih-na suspects Kay of murder simply because Kay is the Yatagarasu. But if I can prove that the Yatagarasu's goal is not related to murder... ...then I may be able to begin to reason with her!)Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight.

I regret to inform you, but there is a flaw in your logic.\" Shih-na: And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body.

I regret to inform you, but there is a flaw in your logic. Shih-na: Oh? Edgeworth: Even if you claim that she is the killer, and the Yatagarasu... ...I am certain that securing the smuggling documents is not the motive behind the murder! The key to the safe in this room was found on Mr. Coachen's body. Furthermore, the Yatagarasu would not be so stupid as to leave without the documents. Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: By the simple fact that the documents were still in the safe when we looked... ...it's obvious that the killer's target was not the safe at all! Shih-na: Shih-na: Then perhaps she didn't know that Mr. Coachen had the key on him. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If that's the case, then why would she have needed to kill him? Because I can think of no reason for her to kill him if she had not known that fact! Shih-na: Shih-na: Need, reason... All of this is simply our conjecturing after the fact. It's entirely possible that she accidentally killed him when she was sneaking him. Edgeworth: .........! Shih-na: Perhaps she didn't notice the safe's second compartment before returning the key. Edgeworth: Arngh! Shih-na: But the fact still remains... that Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But you have no definitive proof that it was Kay who committed the act! Shih-na: Shih-na: ...Actually, I do. I saw her holding the knife she used on the victim with my own eyes. Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? Shih-na: ...Allow me to tell you a bit more about the evidence that will put her away behind bars. Testimony -- Definitive Evidence -- Shih-na: The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife. The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer was holding. I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim. The knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other. The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument. Edgeworth: Nnnnnrrrrrgh... Th-That is your definitive evidence...!? Shih-na: You see now that she is definitely the killer, right? Kay: No! Mr. Edgeworth, you've gotta believe me! I saw a suspicious person in a long black coat outside the Embassy, I swear! Edgeworth: And you came in here because you were chasing this suspicious person? Kay: That's right. I ran into this office only because I was chasing after that person... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the lights, but then... Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ???: ...Who's there!? Shih-na: This is... Shih-na: I came to this room upon hearing the girl's scream. And when I saw her holding the knife, I immediately restrained her. Edgeworth: So the object Kay felt by her feet on the floor was the murder weapon...!? Shih-na: I had the knife analyzed right away, but we failed to find anyone's (changed from [anyone] in the original release, correcting the typo) prints on it. Kay: But the suspicious person in the black coat who came into this room before me...! Shih-na: Shih-na: You continue to insist there was such a person, but if there was, where did they go? Kay: That... I don't know. But I know they came in here! Shih-na: Shih-na: That sounds like the desperate excuses of a suspected killer, not a trustworthy testimony. You understand, don't you? We can't trust this girl's words, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Gnnrk! (She has a point. Even if Kay's words are the truth... ...I must show that they are with some solid evidence!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I really didn't...! Edgeworth: ! Kay... Don't worry. If you didn't do it, then there must exist a way for me to prove that. Shih-na: Shih-na: Still not giving up, I see. In that case, try to counter my argument, if you can. Edgeworth: Don't worry, I can and I will! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Does this mean that you already have the results back? Shih-na: We have confirmed that the shape of the Babahlese knife's blade matches the wound. Please don't confuse the efficiency of Interpol's forensics teams with your own. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I won't if you don't underestimate our police force. And so we're clear, I'd hardly say your logic is sound, which you will see in a bit. Shih-na: If you can prove me wrong... please, by all means go ahead. Edgeworth: That has been my intention all along. Now, let us return to your testimony. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean to say that you saw Kay holding the murder weapon with your own eyes? Shih-na: I was also on the search for the Yatagarasu. When I heard that girl's scream coming from this room, I rushed over straight away. When I arrived, I saw that girl standing there motionless with the knife in her hands. Kay: But I already told you! I only came in here because I was also after the Yatagarasu! The suspicious person I saw came into this room! But when I entered, it was pitch dark. I felt something by my foot on the floor, so I turned on the lights, and then... Edgeworth: ...You found out that it was the murder weapon at your feet. Shih-na: How many times do I have to tell you? We can't trust the words of a suspect. Edgeworth: The only thing you'll accept is evidence, is it? Shih-na: That's the only acceptable way to counter an agent of Interpol on the scene of a crime. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... Do you have some kind of evidence that can prove me innocent...? Edgeworth: I think I do, because there is one piece of evidence I find to be a bit... interesting. (I think I need to carefully examine that piece of evidence again.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I ask that you please refrain from speculation! Shih-na: It's a sound hypothesis derived from the evidence. ...There's no room for debate. Edgeworth: Arngh! ???: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth, know that an ungraceful loss will not be tolerated, my subordinate. Now, rebut her hypothesis with factual logic. Otherwise, what was your investigation for? Edgeworth: Yes, you are correct. Thank you. Franziska: Heh... Helping a subordinate out with advice is the job of any good superior. Edgeworth: (She seems to be rather enjoying herself. But she is correct, none the less [sic].) Agent Shih-na, please continue with your testimony. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: About the three-piece set, is there really no other like it? Shih-na: Let's ask Ambassador Palaeno for more details, shall we? Palaeno: The knives are indeed special. They have the butterfly, the symbol of the Republic of Babahl, engraved on them. And because there are only three of them in the world, they are very, very valuable. Edgeworth: (The national symbol, huh? Well, the knives are covered in the butterfly design...) Palaeno: Along with the Allebahstian set, our respective countries only have three knives each. Edgeworth: I see... Shih-na: Are you satisfied now? If so, let's continue. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: No, I believe there is still room for debate, and I'll thank you to not decide that for me. Shih-na: I didn't decide anything for you. I'm merely looking at reality the way it is. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Are you sure you're not just viewing the facts through rose-colored glasses? Shih-na: ............ Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I think she's mad at you. Edgeworth: ...Perhaps. (But our definitions of reality are a tad different.) Shih-na: ...Are the two of you done chatting? Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na's proof is the Babahlese knife that Kay was allegedly holding. Gumshoe: Yeah... So, um, how are you going to prove that Kay didn't do it, sir? Edgeworth: If Agent Shih-na wants to suspect Kay merely because Kay was the only one here... ...then I must show with evidence that Kay couldn't have committed the murder! Gumshoe: Um, but do you have such evidence, sir? Edgeworth: Yes. There is one piece of evidence that seems very unnatural to me. ...And I believe it is my duty to point that out to Agent Shih-na.\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Kay Faraday\nDescription: Young girl purporting to be the 2nd Yatagarasu.

    "cot": "Evidence 5 states that the knife used as the murder weapon has a butterfly motif and that the blade is Allebahstian, and it questions whether it was carried across country lines, suggesting it might be Allebahstian in origin. This suggests that the knife is more likely from Allebahst.\n\nTestimony 2 from Shih-na claims that \"I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim.\" Edgeworth's investigation states that the knife rack contains knives that are all badly burnt, and the handles have been burnt off, implying the knife held by the suspect cannot be from the rack. This suggests that the suspect could not have taken the knife from the rack in its condition.\n\nTherefore, the evidence about the knife's origin and condition (Evidence 5) and Shih-na's testimony about the knife being taken from the display rack (Testimony 2) contradict each other.\n",

One of the black raven... ...and one of the white raven. A country torn in two. One to the west... ...and one to the east. When those which were split are made whole again... ...the truth will reveal itself. I-It's the Yatagarasu! The Yatagarasu's here! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! -- 8 Hours Earlier -- March 14, 10:17 AM High Prosecutors' Offices - Room 1202 Edgeworth: (It's so nice, almost dreamlike, to finally have the chance to relax and sip some tea. Especially after what a whirlwind the past few days have been.) On my return flight, I was dragged into a case involving an Interpol agent's murder. The next day, I investigated a kidnapping and a murder at the Gatewater Land theme park. And later that night, a detective's dead body welcomed me back to my office... ...along with a thief who was out to pilfer files related to a case from 10 years ago. (How did I manage to find myself in the middle of so many cases back to back? Well, at least I have today. All I ask is that I be allowed to spend it quietly.) ???: Mr. Edgewooooorth! This is big! Big, I tell you! ...Hey, what's wrong with you? Where's your enthusiasm...? Edgeworth: And suddenly, the phrase \"the fragility of dreams\" comes to mind... Kay: What are you talking about, \"fragile dreams\"!? Come on, let's go! The fake Yatagarasu isn't going to just find herself, you know! Edgeworth: Well, if you must know... it's possible that I was paid a visit last night by your \"fake\". Kay: Say what? Edgeworth: ......... Edgeworth: Unfortunately for us, the thief managed to escape. But even now, we're still looking for this criminal. However, I must warn you that we've only had a few hours to search so far... ...so I must insist that you be patient on this one, Kay. Kay: Wh-What's with you today...? Are you sure you aren't sleep-talking to me right now? Anyway, I've got something much more important that I want you to see! Edgeworth: Oh, and that is? Kay: Take a look at this! Edgeworth: \"On March 14th, I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" That's quite a bold declaration to send to an embassy... (I suppose it was inevitable that a newspaper would catch wind of this.) Kay: The date the card mentions is today! Edgeworth: Today, huh... Kay: Come on, we've gotta hurry! The embassy awaits! Edgeworth: I suppose it IS quite an urgent matter... ...however, do you know which country's embassy we should be investigating? Kay: Well, it's some really special country, and I'm actually really fuzzy on the details... But never mind that! Where's all your energy!? Why are you so lackadaisical today!? Edgeworth: I'm not, Kay. You're just too wound up. Kay: Well, then you should get too wound up, too! Because this just might be our chance to catch that woman! Edgeworth: You mean Ms. Yew? (The woman who killed Kay's father, Byrne Faraday, seven years ago... Calisto Yew... She claimed to be the Great Thief Yatagarasu... ...and then disappeared from the courtroom.) Kay: Argh! She makes me so mad! The phony! Everyone knows that the real Yatagarasu would never send something like a calling card! Until a company's underhanded dealings are made public... ...the target is always totally unaware that the Yatagarasu has paid them a visit. That's what makes the real Yatagarasu so awesome! Edgeworth: Hmm... The Yatagarasu's card that's shown in this article... It looks to me as though it could be genuine. Kay: See, that's the thing. Whoever it is, that person isn't the real deal, but has knowledge of the Yatagarasu. If this isn't a clue that that woman's involved, then nothing is! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Out the door you go! Edgeworth: Wait, there are a few preparations I must make before we go... (There's something interesting about this card we found last night here in my office... It's of a different color than the one in the article, which makes me wonder why.) Kay: What's up? Any reason why you're boring a hole through the newspaper with your eyes? Edgeworth: No... No reason at all. Very well. Seeing as how Ms. Yew is also someone of a special nature to me... ...I agree there is some merit to be found in investigating this. Kay: I knew you'd come around! March 14, 5:00 PM Theatrum Neutralis ???: By the light of this night's glorious moon... We are ready! Pink Princess: Ready to embark on our nightly outing. Steel Samurai: And this is where... ...our tale begins! Edgeworth: Heh... What a coincidence. Who would've thought that a Steel Samurai stage show... ...would ever be held at such an elegant theater inside a foreign embassy? Examine evidence Prosecutor's Badge Front of badge Edgeworth: This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so. Back of badge Edgeworth: Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else! Kay: Yeah! The climax was really awesome! \"Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\" I got chills down my spine when he pulled that move out! Edgeworth: I suppose it really is more impactful to watch a show in person than on television. Kay: I have to say, though, this embassy is set up kinda funny. I mean, they have two countries sharing the same building! Edgeworth: Well, as you said yourself, this place and the countries it houses are very special. Even this theater is special in that it is a neutral zone shared by the two countries. Kay: Umm... So, let me get this straight... The Steel Samurai show just now is being sponsored by one of the two countries. The one that's called the Kingdom of Allebahst, right? Edgeworth: Yes, it would appear that the Steel Samurai is very popular in that country as well. Kay: Seems that way! But you know who I'M really into? The Jammin' Ninja! The Republic of Babahl is sponsoring a Jammin' Ninja stage show! That's something for fangirls like me! We've totally gotta see that too, Mr. Edgeworth! The Jammin' Ninja's show is gonna kick the Steel Samurai show's rear end! Edgeworth: (You know, ever since I first met this girl, I've always had this inkling... ...that what she really wants to be... ...is not a thief, but rather, a ninja...) Kay: So anyway, about today's event... umm... What's it called again? Edgeworth: \"The Kingdom of Allebahst versus The Republic of Babahl Goodwill Jubilee\". The small, European countries of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...and the Republic of Babahl. These two countries used to be a single entity that was abundant with nature. And it was called... the Principality of Cohdopia. .................. Kay: Hm? Is everything alright, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Yes, I'm alright. Moving on... After a period of civil unrest, the country split in two, though signs of their past remain. For example, their flags preserve the flower and butterfly motifs to this day. ......... (Cohdopia, huh... The KG-8 Incident... and what was referred to as the second KG-8 Incident... ...in which an Embassy staff member was murdered... Both of these cases were related to the Principality of Cohdopia. In the seven years that have passed, the country may have split into two... ...however, the Yatagarasu still sent a calling card here. What could it all mean?) ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I know you're thinking about something! Edgeworth: Oh, excuse me. What were we talking about again? Kay: Argh, if you could please stop spacing out on me! Anyway, we were talking about the Allebahst versus Babahl Goodwill Jubilee. The two countries have had a pretty bad relationship with each other... ...but supposedly, they've been trying really hard to make up recently. That's why they decided to hold this event. Edgeworth: (If that's the case, then why the \"versus\"...?) Kay: Also, both countries claim to own the real \"Primidux Statue\", a national treasure to both. They're planning to have them publicly evaluated today, to see which one's the real deal. Edgeworth: Kay, need I remind you to take care and not succumb to your thieving desires? Kay: Well, when it comes to treasure, I can't help myself. You know that! Edgeworth: (Nngh... She had better be saying that in jest...) Kay: Hey! I can read your body language, you know! And you've got it all wrong! Look! I'm here to do some investigating! INVESTIGATING, I tell you! Edgeworth: Heh, I know. And although we don't know if the Yatagarasu will really make an appearance... ...I suppose we should still spend some time examining this place. Talk Guard by left door Guard: Is there something I can help you with? Edgeworth: I was wondering what is beyond these doors. Guard: It's the Allebahstian Embassy. Now, unless you have some business with the Embassy... Edgeworth: (I suppose I can't really claim to have any business with the Embassy right now.) Kay: Well, you don't have to be so rude about it, Mr. Guard! Hrmph! Man in blue suit Man: Ten more minutes... No, in five more minutes... But isn't it really bad for me to spend time doing this? It's no use! Would someone please just tell me what I should do! Edgeworth: You appear to be troubled by something. May I be of any assistance? Man: Leave me alone! I'm trying to figure out just the right time to talk to that girl over there! And if I mess up, it'll be because I'm talking to you right now! Kay: Somehow, I get the feeling he's about to fall flat on his face. Edgeworth: Well, let's just do as he wishes and leave him alone. Girls by pamphlets Fan: You know, I've seen a lot of these shows in a bunch of other places... ...but today's show, it was like they went for a complete comedy, know what I mean? Friend: Yeah, And that last move, the Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Sushi Slice] in the original release)... I couldn't help but laugh! Fan: I know, right!? And that Pink Princess's movements were really stiff. In the middle of the show, I could swear that I heard her hip crack. Friend: Oh, I know! I totally thought that, too! The Pink Princess has a bad hip!? Seriously!? Just what were they thinking, you know!? Edgeworth: (I suppose there is no graceful way to enter this conversation...) Man in green suit Man: This is... the perfect angle! Edgeworth: ? Man: Go, my image! Travel across the wave world and into every TV set around the globe! Edgeworth: (A more honest approach to appearing on TV might serve your ambitions better...) Reporter Reporter: And we're here, reporting live from the Theatrum Neutralis. As you can see, tonight's audience is full of enthusiasm! Let's see what this member of the audience has to say. Edgeworth: W-Well, I... Cameraman: OK, that was good. Let's do one more run-through! Edgeworth: Excuse me, but when you are ready to film for real, would you mind giving me a call...? (I sense that she didn't hear a single world I just said.) Cameraman Cameraman: OK, OK, that's good. Alright, now give me a dramatic \"slam!\" right there! Stop! Stoooop! Hey, do you mind!? Get out of the way, buddy. OK, once more! In 3, 2, 1, action! Edgeworth: Kay, was that my fault just now? Kay: Well, he's obviously working... I guess we should leave him alone. Boy by TV Edgeworth: (It appears that the child is watching a video from the first season of the Steel Samurai.) Child: ♪Go! Go! Keep on fighting, until your last breath!♪ ♪Go, my hero, the Steel Samurai!♪ Edgeworth: (Completely absorbed in singing the theme song, I see... I'll let the child watch in peace.) Camerawoman (Lotta Hart) Cameraman: Where in tarnation are they!? Come on, big scoop! Hey, mister! Outta the way! Yeah, I'm talkin' to ya! Edgeworth: Nngh... (I seem to remember this woman from somewhere... ...yet my instincts are directing me not to engage in conversation with her. Perhaps it would be best if I left her alone.) Guard by right door Guard: Is there something I can help you with? Edgeworth: I was wondering what is beyond these doors. Guard: The Babahlese Embassy is just beyond these doors, sir. Do you have some business with the Embassy? Do you require immediate access? Edgeworth: Ah, no, that's quite alright. Guard: Are you sure, sir? Anyone and everyone is always welcome in the Republic of Babahl! Kay: Well, then! Since we're here! Edgeworth: An embassy isn't some sort of theme park, Kay. Kay: Tch! You're such a buzz kill! Examine Pamphlets Edgeworth: There are pamphlets about the two embassies here on this table. Kay: Hmm... It still looks weird to me. Edgeworth: The country split into two a few years back. And they've shared the building and its grounds 50-50 ever since. Kay: Oh? I guess it's because they don't have the money to build two separate ones, huh? Edgeworth: I-I should think that's not the reason why, Kay. Flag by left door Edgeworth: The national flag of the Kingdom of Allebahst is on display here. The crest on it features a flower. Kay: Flowers and butterflies are kind of rare motifs for flags, don't you think? Edgeworth: Well, when they used to be Cohdopia, the government used to take pride in its land. The citizens also loved the rich, bountiful nature all around them, thus the design. Kay: Hey, if the Steel Samurai got popular enough, do you think they'd put him on their flag? Edgeworth: Are you in your right mind, Kay? Kay: Hmm... Or maybe the Jammin' Ninja would make a better candidate...? Edgeworth: (Hah, don't make me laugh (changed from [Heh, don't make me laugh, Kay] in the original release). Only the Steel Samurai deserves such an honor.) Flowers on left side Kay: Those are some nice flowers! I wonder who they're from? \"Gatewater Imperial Hotel\"? Where's this, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Ah, it's an ultra-luxurious hotel that sponsors the Steel Samurai series. I've been there once to investigate a case. Kay: Oh? So what kind of case was it? Edgeworth: I believe it was related to the Nickel Samurai and the Jammin' Ninja... Kay: Oh, I remember reading about that! You must be the head of Steel Samurai affairs down at the Prosecutor's Office, huh? Edgeworth: (I should think that even you can figure that such an office does not exist, Kay.) TV Edgeworth: There is a flat-panel, a tape deck, and a row of Steel Samurai videos on this table. I suppose it's so visitors can watch an episode or two at their leisure. Kay: I guess it really is just that popular, huh? Edgeworth: Yes, although I never thought I would see it reach this level of popularity... Kay: I wonder why they decided to call on the Steel Samurai for an event like this? I mean, it's like they intended to cut the two countries apart with the Samurai Sword instead! Edgeworth: (Wouldn't that go against the whole point of this event...?) Flowers on right side Edgeworth: These flowers were sent by Global Studios. Kay: Global Studios? Edgeworth: That's where they film the Steel Samurai television show. They have been producing hit after hit recently, so the studio is being remodeled. Kay: Oh! I read about that in the papers the other day! That mascot of theirs is also getting a face-lift, too, right? Umm... what's its name? Edgeworth: You mean Mrs. Monkey? Kay: Yeah, I thought it was something like that! You really have a great memory! Edgeworth: Hah! Never underestimate my powers of recollection. Flag by right door Edgeworth: The national flag of the Republic of Babahl is on display here. The crest on it features a butterfly. Kay: It's really rare to see a national flag featuring an animal on it! Edgeworth: Not really. I can list at least a few off for you that do. Kay: OK, then are there any flags with really chic things on them? Edgeworth: \"Chic\" things? That's pretty vague, Kay... Although, by my definition, there aren't really any flags that feature a \"chic\" object. Kay: Aww, that's too bad. Because if there was, I was thinking about stealing it... Edgeworth: (And what exactly would you do with a stolen national flag, Kay...?) Partner Edgeworth: There's a very festive atmosphere in here. Kay: Yup, super festive! I'm really happy for the Kingdom of Allebahst and the Republic of Babahl. It's great that they have re-established diplomatic relations! The newspapers say that it's almost like they're Cohdopia once again. Edgeworth: Perhaps we are bearing witness to a historic moment in time. Kay: Hey! Look! They're selling some commemorative merchandise to celebrate this event! Founder's Cohdopia Biscuits. And over here, they're selling Royal Cohdopia Biscuits. Edgeworth: ...It would seem that they have yet to reconcile their competitive spirits. After examining pamphlets: Edgeworth: I suppose I'll just help myself to one of these... Embassy Guide stuck into the pages of my Organizer. Edgeworth: (Hm? What is all the hubbub?) Ack! Kay: Hey, look! It's the Steel Samurai! And he's got his son, the Iron Infant, with him!! Talk Steel Samurai Leads to: \"May I speak with you for a second?\" Edgeworth: May I speak with you for a second? (...It's... the Steel Samurai...) Steel Samurai: ......... Edgeworth: ......... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! What are you glaring at him for!? Edgeworth: Ahem, please excuse me. It's just that I've never seen a super-hero up close before. Steel Samurai: ......... Kay: It looks like he's written something down for you! Edgeworth: \"To Edgeworth, From Steel Samurai Daddy: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo\" Kay: Wow, an autograph! Pretty cool that you got one, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Heh... Steel Samurai's Autograph received. Guard: Mr. Steel Samurai! Ambassador Alba is waiting for you! Reporter: And now the Steel Samurai... ...will proceed to enter the Kingdom of Allebahst to shake the hand of the ambassador. The Steel Samurai isn't only here for the two countries tonight... ...but rather, can be thought of as a goodwill ambassador from our own country as well! Kay: There he goes. Off to spread goodwill to the world. Edgeworth: He really does seem like a goodwill ambassador, doesn't he? Cameraman: OK! We're shooting the next segment now! Cue camera! Reporter: In just a few seconds, the Jammin' Ninja stage show is set to begin. After the show, the Jammin' Ninja will enter the Republic of Babahl. He is set to meet with the Ambassador of Babahl at that time. Kay: AHH! The Jammin' Ninja's show is about to start! We've gotta get back to our seats! Edgeworth: Regrettably... I don't have much of an interest in ninjas... Kay: Well, this show will change your mind! Come on, we have to hurry! If we miss even a second of the Jammin' Ninja's awesome playing, I'll never forgive you! Edgeworth: (Nngh... I suppose you're not about to give me much of a choice here, are you, Kay?) Kay: Ahhh! I could listen to that \"A Ninja Marked for Death's Lullaby\" song all day! His superb playing and that sad melody really brought a tear to my eye! And his heart-wrenching voice! Now THAT'S the Jammin' Ninja's greatest weapon! Edgeworth: .................. Kay: Ahh! Those pieces of Jammin' Ninja merchandise over there! I've got to have them! I especially want the hair sticks they're selling exclusively at these shows. They're exactly like the ones the heroine, Princess Misola, wears in her hair! Edgeworth: ...Anyway. Kay: Anyway!? ANYWAY!? Hold it right there, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: You're thinking of going home, aren't you!? Edgeworth: Well, it doesn't seem likely that the Yatagarasu will be making an appearance tonight. Most likely, it was simply a prank. Kay: No way! I just know the Yatagarasu will show! Edgeworth: But I thought you said that the Yatagarasu doesn't send calling cards. Kay: Yeah, I did, but... Edgeworth: I figured from the very beginning that this would wind up being a wild goose chase. Kay: But that card she sent was a genuine fake calling card! Edgeworth: A genuine fake...? Kay: Well, how can I word this...? The Yatagarasu's mark that's on the calling card is exactly the same as my mark. Get it now? Officer: W-We've got a problem! Th-The Yatagarasu has been spotted in Allebahst! Edgeworth: What!? Kay: You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Hah! So you finally decided to show yourself, you phony! Hey, what gives!? Guard: I'm sorry but I will need to search you before you may enter. Kay: What the!? Hey! The Steel Samurai just waltzed straight on through without one! Now if you don't hurry up and let me through, my phony is going to escape! Edgeworth: Kay, a country's embassy is considered to be a part of the country itself. If you don't go through the proper procedures to enter the country... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm going to enter through Babahl and climb over the wall into Allebahst! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You would tell a prosecutor straight out that you intend to illegally enter another... Kay, are you listening to me!? Kay: Kay Faraday, and I'm coming through! Guard: Yes, and welcome! Edgeworth: Someone stop her! Anyone! March 14, 6:12 PM Open-Air Stage Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay... Where are you? Don't tell me you really did find some way over this fence... Ack! Guard: Fire! This is too big for us to handle! Looks like the Yatagarasu came to Babahl, too! Edgeworth: You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! You had better be alright, wherever you are! March 14, 6:45 PM Babahlese Embassy - Secretariat's Office Kay: I told you! It wasn't me! Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: *huff, huff, huff*... Kay! Are you alright!? Kay: Do I look alright to you!? Now, can you do something about this woman!? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe! What is the meaning of this!? Gumshoe: *sigh* Well, sir... it's um, this. Edgeworth: He's...! Kay: It wasn't me! He was already dead when I ran in here, hot on the heels of the fake Yatagarasu! Look, I only came in here because I saw a suspicious person at the open-air stage! Edgeworth: A suspicious person? Kay: A long, black coat and a hood over their head -- I dare you to tell me that's not suspicious! When I saw that person, I immediately thought that they must be the fake Yatagarasu. So I chased after them into the Embassy, then into here, and then lost sight of them... But I just KNOW that person is the one who did it! Shih-na: What are you so worked up over? There is no reason for you to be this loud. Edgeworth: Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're Agent Lang's secretary... ...Shih-na, I believe your name is, correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: And if you are making an arrest... ...I assume you have evidence that it was Kay who committed the crime, is that also correct? Shih-na: .................. Edgeworth: You refuse to answer!? Shih-na: I don't need to answer. Edgeworth: ! Shih-na: You are merely a prosecutor in this country, meaning you have no investigative authority. Gumshoe: H-Hey, pal! Just what the heck does what you just said mean!? If it happened here, it's under Mr. Edgeworth's jurisdiction. The end. And seeing as how this building is sitting on our soil, we can investigate wherever we'd like! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, Detective, embassies are a different matter. Gumshoe: Huh? Edgeworth: This office is considered to be a part of the Republic of Babahl. Which means that anything that happens in here... ...defaults to the control of the Babahlese government and Babahlese law... ...giving them exclusive extraterritorial rights. Gumshoe: Extraterrestrial (changed from [Extraterristrial] in the original release, correcting the typo) rights? Sir, do you really believe that the truth is out there!? Edgeworth: *sigh* Basically, our country's laws do not apply inside the embassy of another country. That's what was agreed to by our respective governments. Our authority to investigate was effectively nullified the second we entered this place. Which means we can do little here in this situation... Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! Shih-na: Please leave this matter in Interpol's hands and go home. Edgeworth: N...Nnnnngh... Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Kay: H-Hey, you're not...!? Mr. Edgeworth! ???: ???: In that case... allow me to join your investigation. Gumshoe: M-Ms. von Karma! Eeek! Franziska: Ambassador Palaeno, I truly appreciate you allowing me to join the investigation. Palaeno: It's really nothing. Manny was my secretariat, so of course I want to help you as much as I can. In fact, it's a blessing that Interpol agents were able to make it so quickly. Edgeworth: Franziska... Franziska: Well, well. I never imagined that I'd meet you here of all places. This is an embassy, meaning that you have no authority to conduct... Edgeworth: Franziska: A-Already!? What is it!? Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Hm? And you are? Edgeworth: I'm Miles Edgeworth, public prosecutor. I ask that you please allow me to investigate this case as Ms. von Karma's assistant. Gumshoe: A...Assistant? Franziska: Miles!? What the heck do you think you're...!? Edgeworth: Please, I implore you, Ambassador Palaeno. Palaeno: Very well. I'll be counting on the two of you, Ms. von Karma and Mr. Edgeworth. Gumshoe: Umm... What did you mean by you'll be Ms. von Karma's assistant...? Edgeworth: I don't exactly have a choice, do I, Detective? If I don't become Franziska's assistant, I can't participate in this investigation. Franziska: Hmph. There you go again, running at the mouth with that aloof expression on your face. Edgeworth: Franziska, please... Franziska: I don't know what you're planning quite yet... ...but at least I do know one thing -- that you are now my subordinate. Just remember that my whip is always ready to wake you, should you have a brain lapse. Edgeworth: Of course. I'll keep that in mind. Shih-na: ...If you are done playing games...! Edgeworth: Right. let's begin the investigation. Begin Investigation Babahlese Embassy - Secretariat's Office Edgeworth: By the way, Detective... I suppose it's a bit late to be asking, but why are you here? Gumshoe: Well, better late than never, I guess, sir. I was placed on guard duty for the Babahlese Embassy today! Edgeworth: And why are our police guarding an embassy? Gumshoe: Well, on account of the card they got from the Yatagarasu... ...they called us up and asked for our help, sir. Oh, and because we've been searching for the Yatagarasu these past seven years! It was a more or less mutually beneficial arrangement, if you ask me! Edgeworth: Except for how mutually unbeneficial this has all turned out to be, I suppose. It looks like you failed to competently perform your guard duty yet again. Gumshoe: Ack...! Edgeworth: Look forward to your next salary negotiation... although, it's out of my hands. Gumshoe: But sir! If it gets cut any more, I won't be able to buy even instant (changed from [packet] in the original release) noodles anymore... Talk Franziska von Karma Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What is it? Franziska: Let me tell you something. You are currently my subordinate. And if you wish to convince everyone else of that, you will speak to me with respect! Edgeworth: (What's with the giddy glint in her eyes?) I don't think that will really be necessary, Franziska. Franziska: Oh, really? Well, it doesn't matter. It doesn't change the fact that you are still under me. Edgeworth: (I thought Franziska was flying around the world in pursuit of the smuggling case. So then, why is she here at this embassy (Franziska's return - Why is she here when she is supposed to be overseas in pursuit of a smuggling ring?)...?) Talk The murder Franziska: I was investigating at the Allebahstian Embassy when I got wind of this mess. Edgeworth: Ah, that's right. The Yatagarasu was due to appear at that embassy as well. Franziska: Yes, but the difference is that we didn't have a fire over there. Although, there was an incident at the Allebahstian Embassy as well... But I left Agent Lang in charge of that case and came over to the Babahlese Embassy. Edgeworth: Ah... So Agent Lang is here as well, huh? Franziska: I see you've met. Well, he's in the Allebahstian Embassy acting as body guard for Ambassador Alba. ...However, he seems to have a different reason for being there. Yatagarasu (appears after \"The murder\") Franziska: So the suspect in the murder that occurred in this office is that little girl, I see. Is she, perhaps, trying to be the Yatagarasu? Gumshoe: K-Kay would never harm a soul, sir! Franziska: ...Kay? Edgeworth: You remember, do you not? About the case we investigated together seven years ago? That girl is the daughter of the victim in that case, Mr. Faraday. Franziska: ! So she's that feisty little girl... Edgeworth: Kay has been on the trail of the Yatagarasu, which is how she ended up here... ...looking for the one who took her father's life. Franziska: ...I see. Gumshoe: Kay's trying so hard, but you know what!? The Yatagarasu just keeps on tricking us all! Edgeworth: Hm...? How so? Gumshoe: The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret (Stealing of secret - The card warned that the Yatagarasu will steal the embassy's 'dirtiest secret'.)\"... ...but all we've had is an arson and a murder! The lab boys are going in circles! You know what this is, sirs!? It's a breach of contract, and it's going on the rap sheet! Franziska: If you ask me, I'm perfectly fine with the fact that nothing was stolen tonight. Edgeworth: (I do wonder, though, if Calisto Yew really is the Yatagarasu...) Smuggling (appears after connecting \"Stealing of secret\" and \"Franziska's return\" Logic) Edgeworth: Franziska, when we last talked, you said that you were on the trail of a smuggling ring. I suppose the reason you are here right now is related to that? Franziska: ...Yes. After analyzing the intel we've gathered from various countries... ...this embassy... rose to the top of our list of sites to investigate. And this is what tipped us off. Edgeworth: This accounting document...? Franziska: It's only one page of the whole thing, so we're not sure about all the details... ...however, it's enough for us to grab onto the tail of the beast. For you see... this type of paper was made only in the Principality (changed from [Kingdom] in the original release) of Cohdopia. Which means that somewhere in the countries of Allebahst and Babahl is the head! The one pulling the strings behind the entire smuggling ring! Edgeworth: (That's Franziska for you... She's amazing -- pursuing this case with all she has.) Cohdopian Paper Document data jotted down in my Organizer. Smuggling (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Franziska, when we last talked, you said that you were on the trail of a smuggling ring. I suppose the reason you are here right now is related to that? Franziska: ...Yes. After analyzing the intel we've gathered from various countries... ...this embassy... rose to the top of our list of sites to investigate. And this is what tipped us off. Edgeworth: This accounting document...? Franziska: It's only one page of the whole thing, so we're not sure about all the details... ...however, it's enough for us to grab onto the tail of the beast. For you see... this type of paper was made only in the Principality (changed from [Kingdom] in the original release) of Cohdopia. Which means that somewhere in the countries of Allebahst and Babahl is the head! The one pulling the strings behind the entire smuggling ring! Edgeworth: (That's Franziska for you... She's amazing -- pursuing this case with all she has.) Present Prosecutor's Badge Franziska: What about your Prosecutor's Badge? I have one, too, you know. Edgeworth: Ah, yes... So you do. But seeing as I'm not currently a proper prosecutor, I thought I'd give presenting it a try. Franziska: ............ Is that any way for you to act towards your superior!? Edgeworth: As if threatening a whipping is the proper way of lecturing someone! Notes on Coachen's Body Franziska: It appears that he died of a stab wound. Arngh!! Whoever did this had a lot of nerve! I just can't fathom what could've led the killer to turn a knife against a man! Edgeworth: And I just can't fathom what the prosecutor lashing out with her whip is thinking... Knife or Yatagarasu's Key Franziska: Would you mind not pointing that in my direction? It's dangerous. And anyway, why are you showing it to me? Edgeworth: I have no particular reason... Franziska: !! Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Franziska: If you have no reason! Don't you bring that dangerous object near me! Do you understand!? Edgeworth: ! (I-Is she really that oblivious to the irony in that statement? She lets loose that dangerous whip of hers for no reason all the time!) Cohdopian Paper Document Franziska: We were able to finally obtain this proof of the smuggling operation through Interpol. So remember to take extra care when handling it... my subordinate. Edgeworth: *sigh*... (She's enjoying the power trip of calling me her subordinate just a taaaad too much...) Anything else Edgeworth: Ms. von Karma, what do you think of this piece of evidence? Franziska: Hmph, well, since you asked so nicely as my subordinate, I'll answer you. However, as your superior, I also must make sure that my subordinates grow on the job. Therefore, please gather your own thoughts together first, and then try presenting again. Edgeworth: (A simple, \"I don't have any thoughts about that\" would've sufficed...) Colias Palaeno Palaeno: I can't believe that Manny fell among thieves tonight... Without him, I have no idea what my schedule for tonight is. Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, I believe your schedule tonight will consist of... ...listening to reports from the police. That and only that. I ask you to cooperate not only for your own sake, but for Mr. Coachen's as well. Palaeno: ...You're a rather strong man, aren't you? How fascinating! Here, I know it isn't much, but I'd like you to have these. Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but it would be against my principles to accept a bribe. Palaeno: Oh, no, no. These are simply coupons we distribute to promote Babahl. Remember, we offer a large number of discounts and offers when you visit lovely Babahl! Edgeworth: (Now I remember. The Republic of Babahl is known for its feverish tourism industry...) Talk Manny Coachen Edgeworth: I was wondering if you might tell me a bit about the deceased, Manny Coachen. Palaeno: He was my secretary, and the embassy secretariat, charged with running the whole place. He was an admirable man. His death is a great loss to our country. He was in charge of everything, accounting, printing, taking care of our national treasures... Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but did you say \"printing\"? Palaeno: Our country's primary source of revenue is our tourism industry. So, in order for us to print the necessary pamphlets, flyers, coupons, etcetera... ...we have a printing press here at our embassy. Edgeworth: I see. Please excuse my forwardness, however... ...I feel I should mention that I have the distinct impression that I've met him before. Palaeno: ! Oh, yes... Since you are of the legal profession, I suppose you just might have. After all, Manny was involved in the KG-8 Incident. Edgeworth: Th-The KG-8 Incident!? Palaeno: The defendant who was found innocent in that case was Manny. Edgeworth: So your Mr. Coachen is the same man as the one in that case... Palaeno: It's been 10 years. Manny recovered personally from that case, and dove enthusiastically into this job. He was the one who planned this event, and was to oversee this embassy's renovations. It really is a shame. He had such a bright future ahead of him. Renovations (appears after \"Manny Coachen\") Edgeworth: What exactly did you mean earlier by \"renovations\"? Palaeno: We can't have tourists and visitors to our embassy think we're a poor nation, can we? So renovating the embassy is something of an investment. We may have a rather paltry budget, but we're trying our best to make do (changed from [due] in the original release, correcting the typo). However... ...I guess the only person who could've helped us do our best is now no longer with us. Cohdopia (appears after examining key on body and clearing \"Manny Coachen\" Talk option) Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, I was wondering if I may ask you about Cohdopia. Palaeno: Cohdopia? Alright. What would you like to talk about? Edgeworth: First... I'd like to ask you about this key. Palaeno: Hm? What about this key? Edgeworth: I found it sticking out of Mr. Coachen's pocket. I believe it originally belonged to this embassy. Is that correct? Palaeno: Hmm... Upon closer inspection, it seems that this key is shaped like a butterfly. Edgeworth: That's not all about this key. It's also capable of changing into a knife. Palaeno: Oh! How fascinating! Edgeworth: (Is it possible that the ambassador didn't know about the existence of this key...?) Palaeno: ...Hm? In its knife form, there is a flower mark at the base of the blade. Hmm... I guess this knife might be from when we used to be a part of Cohdopia. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And how did you come to that conclusion? Palaeno: It has both of Cohdopia's national symbols, the butterfly and the flower. I suppose Manny used this key here at the embassy (Key used at Embassy - This key was stolen from the Cohdopian Embassy 7 years ago by the Yatagarasu.) back when we were still Cohdopia. Franziska: Ambassador Palaeno, this key was stolen from the Cohdopian Embassy seven years ago... ...by Calisto Yew, otherwise known as the Great Thief Yatagarasu. Palaeno: ! O-Oh, really? Edgeworth: You were not aware that Ms. Yew had broken into this embassy at that time? Palaeno: I'm sorry I can't be of much help. I'm not very familiar with the details, you see. I only became the ambassador after Babahl became its own independent nation. But if Manny were still alive, he would probably know about what happened back then... Edgeworth: (Mr. Coachen and Ms. Yew knew each other seven years ago... But that doesn't explain why I found the Yatagarasu's Key here in the present.) Present Prosecutor's Badge Palaeno: Oh, is that a Prosecutor's Badge? It has a very cool design! Aha! I know! We should start selling items like this as souvenirs in Babahl! The tourists will absolutely go nuts over them! Edgeworth: (Please don't compare a proud symbol of my profession to a cheap souvenir...) Embassy Guide Palaeno: Oh, isn't that about our great embassy? Ah... How do you like our pamphlets? Edgeworth: I feel indifferent about them, to be honest. I'm just using this as evidence. Palaeno: Oh, that's too bad... In that case, I guess we'll just have to try harder to make more charming ones! ! I-I just had a flash of inspiration! We should make all of our pamphlets into coupon books! Edgeworth: ............ (His expectations of what a coupon can do is just a tad hyper-inflated.) Notes on Coachen's Body or Knife Palaeno: Oh, dear... If people were to find out that a murder occurred at our embassy... ...the number of tourists would plummet, as would our revenues! It'd be a disaster! What are we going to do...? Edgeworth: (He really does seem worried. Perhaps I should refrain from bringing this up...) Babahl's Primidux Statue Palaeno: This statue resembles that hero, the Steel Samurai, don't you think? I was thinking, what would you say to changing its name to the \"Steel Samurai Statue\"? It just might attract a few more tourists to our country if I did, right? Edgeworth: I-I'm not sure what to think... (I thought that thing was a national treasure...) Anything else Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, I was wondering if you might have some thoughts on this. Palaeno: I think that you would know more about the case than I. So let me make it up to you for not knowing anything about that with these coupons! Edgeworth: ...Thank you, however, I feel I must decline. Officer Officer: Sorry, but Interpol is still conducting its investigation beyond this point. Edgeworth: I'm a subordinate of Ms. von Karma. Is there some reason why I'm being denied access? Officer: My superior clearly stated, \"Don't you dare let anyone near the site, you got it!?\" If I let you examine the site, my superior would get really angry at me! Gumshoe: You know, Mr. Edgeworth... I feel really bad for the guy, so why don't we do as he says? Edgeworth: Yes... I suppose we might as well. Shih-na or Kay Faraday Edgeworth: Kay, are you alright? Kay: You believe me, don't you, Mr. Edgeworth? You don't think I did it, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, of course I don't. And I promise to prove that it wasn't you. Shih-na: That's enough chit-chat. You can investigate all you like, but it's only a matter of time before we take her in. It would be wise of you to give up while you can. Edgeworth: No, I don't think so. Kay isn't lying, and my investigation will prove that to be true. Shih-na: Go ahead and try then, if you're that confident. Edgeworth: (I can't allow this to continue on this way. I must prove her innocence post haste!) Examine Fireplace Gumshoe: That's some fireplace! You know, it really gives this place a mansion-like quality, don't you think, sir!? Ooh! If these are a staple in every Babahlese house... ...then I bet Santa Claus pays them a visit, too. Edgeworth: (Just how old are you again, Detective...?) Safe Edgeworth: A small, personal safe... Franziska: This was Mr. Coachen's office. So perhaps he stored his most important documents in here. Edgeworth: Ah, of course it's locked. It appears we won't be able to open it without the key (Locked safe - The secretariat's office safe. It can't be opened without the key.). Body Edgeworth: So our victim... was the secretariat of this embassy, I take it. Franziska: Manny Coachen. I heard that he was an admirable person... very admirable. Edgeworth: The cause of death is a stab to the base of his neck... He was lax in watching his back. Franziska: We were fortunate that the fire missed our victim's body for the most part. If the fire had burned a bit longer, it would've made identifying him a hassle. Edgeworth: (So Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death in the middle of a raging fire...? What in the world happened inside this room?) Notes on Coachen's Body jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Body Edgeworth: (Hm? This man... Where do I know him from...?) Wound Edgeworth: It's a knife wound. Franziska: It's obvious what he was killed with, but I wonder if it's consistent with the wound? Shih-na: Indeed. Knife Edgeworth: Is this knife the murder weapon...!? Shih-na: Some preliminary testing has been conducted. According to the results, the blood on that matches the victim's blood. The blade's shape was also found to be consistent with the stab wound. Edgeworth: I suppose this means that we now know that the crime was committed with this knife. Gumshoe: This knife's got some really fancy ornamentation going on, huh, sir? This thing practically screams \"ARTSY!\" at me, too! Although, it's also covered in blood, just like the last thing that I said was artsy... Franziska: Hmm, but the handle is pristine, there's not a single drop of blood on it. Speaking of the handle... I believe it has a butterfly motif (Motif on knife handle - A butterfly-shaped guard adorns the handle of the murder weapon.). It's very beautiful. Knife data jotted down in my Organizer. Knife (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Is this knife the murder weapon...!? Shih-na: Some preliminary testing has been conducted. According to the results, the blood on that matches the victim's blood. The blade's shape was also found to be consistent with the stab wound. Edgeworth: I suppose this means that we now know that the crime was committed with this knife. Gumshoe: This knife's got some really fancy ornamentation going on, huh, sir? This thing practically screams \"ARTSY!\" at me, too! Although, it's also covered in blood, just like the last thing that I said was artsy... Franziska: Hmm, but the handle is pristine, there's not a single drop of blood on it. Speaking of the handle... I believe it has a butterfly motif. It's very beautiful. Key Edgeworth: Hmm... There appears to be something in his pocket. ! This key! It can't be...! Isn't this the Yatagarasu's Key that was stolen seven years ago!? Franziska: What!? But that's...! Gumshoe: Huh? Seven years ag...oooh! You mean that case where I was framed, sir!? Edgeworth: Yes, it's the piece of evidence that stole the life of Kay's father seven years ago... ...which was then stolen by Calisto Yew. Gumshoe: Wh-What!? Mr. Faraday was killed with this key, sir!? I thought he was killed with a knife... Eeeek! Franziska: Scruffy! At the very least, try to remember the details of crimes you were a suspect in! Edgeworth: Franziska, as you will recall... ...Detective Gumshoe was not present when Ms. Yew made her escape. Plus, even among law enforcement, only a few knew of this key's existence. I doubt that a new rookie at the time would've been made privy to such knowledge. Gumshoe: Ooonnngh... I feel like the victim right now, all trampled on, sir! Edgeworth: Hmph... I suppose I'll just have to fill you in now. The secret to this key is...! Leads to examination of Yatagarasu's Key Examine butterfly=shaped key Edgeworth: It's not that far-fetched to think that the end of this key was meant to be a butterfly. The key maker must've been a true patriot to have fashioned this after the national symbol. Examine button in handle Leads to: \"Ohoooo!\" Gumshoe: Ohoooo! Wow, that's amazing, sir! It's like some kind of magic trick! Yatagarasu's Key data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: I knew it. This is the same exact piece of evidence that Ms. Yew took with her... I remember this beautiful pattern in the blade. Franziska: I remember this as well. It's a vine motif, isn't it? Edgeworth: Yes, it looks like two interwoven vines, crisscrossing down the blade. Gumshoe: Vines, sirs? I think it looks like a bunch of stars, if you ask me. It's one of those six-sided stars, just like the police mark on our IDs! Edgeworth: I... really don't think you can call these stars. (...To say that the detective's art sense is underdeveloped would be an understatement.) Franziska: The real question is why was the Babahlese Embassy's secretariat holding this? Edgeworth: While we don't know how Mr. Coachen came to possess this key... ...we do know that this was stolen by the Yatagarasu from the Cohdopian Embassy. Franziska: That's right. Mr. Faraday had written that fact down in his organizer. Edgeworth: I believe this means that further research is required into the country of Cohdopia. Franziska: Why don't you ask Ambassador Palaeno about what he knows? Supposedly, he was a candidate to be the next Cohdopian ambassador once long ago. He should be able to answer any specific questions you may have. Key (subsequent times) Edgeworth: It's the Yatagarasu's Key... I wonder how it managed to return here? Gumshoe: So this key was stolen by Calisto Yew seven years ago, right? Edgeworth: Yes, although originally, it was stolen from this very building. Gumshoe: Well, then, maybe Ms. Yew just decided to bring it back. Edgeworth: I can't dismiss that possibility, however... (...it doesn't fit her modus operandi, given all of her other actions.) Body (after examining knife and key) Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Butterfly on wall Gumshoe: Heeeey! It's another butterfly! Edgeworth: I believe it is the symbol of the Republic of Babahl (Buttlerfly of Babahl - National symbol that adorns the national flag. Allebahst's flower is its counterpart.). A drawing this big on the wall of an embassy... It definitely conveys a sense of overwhelming patriotism. Gumshoe: Well, I've got a lot of patriotism, too, sir! The reason I became a cop in the first place was because I wanted to protect our country! Edgeworth: You may want to, Detective, however, I have yet to see the fruits of your desire. Gumshoe: Y-You don't have to be so blunt about it, sir! Broken ceiling fan Edgeworth: This ceiling fan must've fallen from the ceiling. Gumshoe: A ceiling fan? What does one of those do? Edgeworth: Exactly what it sounds like it does; it's a fan that is installed on one's ceiling. Gumshoe: Well, if I had one of those in my room, I bet I'd go dizzy from staring at it as I slept. Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe. In the real world, we close our eyes when we sleep. Golden statue Palaeno: Because this is a national treasure, can I ask that you please not touch it? I'm afraid the only ones allowed to touch it are myself and the secretariat. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But there is a possibility that it is related to the murder, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Why don't we give up for now? We can force them to let us investigate it later when we find some solid proof! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I don't have a choice here. (This must be one of the Primidux Statues Kay was talking about earlier. ............ Is it just me or does this man look just like the Steel Samurai? They could be twins.) Babahl's Primidux Statue data jotted down in my Organizer. Golden statue (subsequent times) Palaeno: Because this is a national treasure, can I ask that you please not touch it? I'm afraid the only ones allowed to touch it are myself and the secretariat. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But there is a possibility that it is related to the murder, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Why don't we give up for now? We can force them to let us investigate it later when we find some solid proof! Edgeworth: ...I suppose I don't have a choice here. (This must be one of the Primidux Statues Kay was talking about earlier. ............ Is it just me or does this man look just like the Steel Samurai? They could be twins.) Knife rack Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! There's still something on this display rack, sir! Edgeworth: Knives, huh... Although, the blades are all that remain of them, unfortunately. Gumshoe: I guess the handles all got burnt off by the fire. Palaeno: Ah... So even the knives fell victim to the fire... Edgeworth: Ambassador Palaeno, are these knives yours? Palaeno: Why yes, they are. They are a special set of ornamental knives featuring the national symbol of Babahl. These butterfly-themed knives, along with Allebahst's own set of knives... ...are comprised of three knives each. But... But I can't believe the Babahlese ones have been reduced to this state... Edgeworth: Hmm... (Ornamental knives, huh? ...Hm? There's a small release on the tang of this blade.) Ambassador Palaeno, what is this notch here for...? Palaeno: Oh, that! It's a feature of these knives wherein you can freely exchange the handles on them. So that we can change how they look to fit the situation, of course. Edgeworth: I see. So these knives were constructed so that the handles could be easily removed. Shelves Edgeworth: These shelves are lined with American souvenirs and memorabilia. Gumshoe: It's really strange isn't it? I mean, I thought this was the Babahlese Embassy! So, umm, why are there so many American souvenirs, sir? Edgeworth: Perhaps the Babahlese are studying American culture and our tourism industry...? If they have plans to make the Babahlese tourism industry truly flourish... ...then they would need to observe and study other countries' methods, I suppose. Gumshoe: Speaking of tourism, I got these from the blond guy earlier, sir. He said that if I bring these with me to Babahl, I can trade them in for a few buffets! Edgeworth: Oh? So, how do you expect to travel to Babahl? Gumshoe: Well, the whole world is connected by the oceans, sir! And for an all-you-can-eat buffet, I'd swim all the way to Babahl if I have to! Edgeworth: (Can a few simple coupons really motivate people to do such fantastic things?) Burnt objects by clock Edgeworth: There are still some burnt objects scattered on the floor. Gumshoe: Well, burnt things get burnt and then they become burnt things, you know? Edgeworth: No, because there is no way to prove that the burnt thing started out as a burnt thing. Gumshoe: Was it a burnt thing, or was it not? I have no idea what's what anymore, sir... Edgeworth: Yes, I suppose it's a bit hard for someone with a burnt-out light bulb to comprehend. Grandfather clock Edgeworth: It looks like this was once a magnificent grand father [sic] (changed from [grand grandfather] in the original release) clock, but it has fallen victim to the fire. Gumshoe: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! Is it OK for me to talk about the clocks in my house, sir? Edgeworth: If they're unrelated to the case, I hope that you will refrain from sharing, but... Gumshoe: Well, there's this one clock that I made by myself, but the timer on it manages to auto... Edgeworth: That's quite enough, Detective. Examine evidence Knife Blade Edgeworth: So this is what took Mr. Coachen's life. Some of his blood is still on the blade. Gumshoe: Wow, I've been a detective for 7 years already? I've seen a lot of weapons in my days... ...but knives that were used to kill are always the hardest for me to bear. Edgeworth: Yes, unlike guns, this is one weapon where you're likely to find the victim's blood on it. Gumshoe: Yeah, just like how this one is practically drenched in it, huh, sir? Edgeworth: (Despite that, it looks like the blood managed to miss the handle somehow.) Ornate butterfly on handle Edgeworth: There is a lot of skilled detailing on this handle. I believe this is a butterfly. Gumshoe: This is one amazing ornamental knife. And I'm really glad that this beautiful butterfly wasn't ruined by blood. Edgeworth: There is not even a drop of blood on it. It really is quite exquisite. So much so that even you can understand its beauty, Detective. Gumshoe: Hey, why do you always have to look down on my tastes, sir!? I know what I like, and this is really well-crafted! Edgeworth: (Why do I look down on his tastes...? Because, my dear Detective, I'm afraid your tastes are usually quite questionable...) ! This knife... It would appear that the handle is removable. Gumshoe: I guess so people can change them whenever they feel like it. Sounds like fun, sir! Edgeworth: (I don't think people would remove the handle just for fun, Detective...) Yatagarasu's Key Knife blade Edgeworth: There is a vine motif to the ornamentation on this blade. Even if Detective Gumshoe claims to see a star motif in it. Between the blade and handle, there is a flower, and the key itself is a butterfly. This key was stolen by the Yatagarasu seven years ago from the Cohdopian Embassy... ...which suggests that this was made while Cohdopia still existed as a country. Button in handle Edgeworth: We discovered this trick seven years ago, and with it, we were able to corner Ms. Yew. But who would've thought that I'd see this key again after all this time... Butterfly-shaped key Edgeworth: It's not that far-fetched to think that the end of this key was meant to be a butterfly. Logic Connect \"Locked safe\" and \"Key used at Embassy\" Leads to: \"We know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy.\" Connect \"Stealing of secret\" and \"Franziska's return\" Edgeworth: \"To steal your dirtiest secret\"... Is it possible that the \"dirty secret\" the Yatagarasu was out to steal is in this very room? Franziska: \"Dirty secret\"? Edgeworth: Franziska, you're in pursuit of some \"dirty\" underhanded dealings yourself, are you not? Something tells me that this is no coincidence. Franziska: In that case then, the person I'm looking for is here in the Babahlese Embassy, huh? The head of the smuggling operation! Edgeworth: (I think I just might need to ask Franziska about her smuggling case in more depth.) Connect \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\" Edgeworth: The design on the knife's handle... ...it greatly resembles the special Babahlese species of butterfly. Franziska: It does, doesn't it? Plus, it says right here. Edgeworth: \"This knife is property of the Republic of Babahl.\" Perhaps this means that the knife used in the crime was found right in this room...? Partner Gumshoe: Yes, sir? Talk The murder Edgeworth: While you were on guard duty, did you notice anything unusual? Gumshoe: Well, I was on watch inside the Embassy... ...but unfortunately, I didn't run into the Yatagarasu, sir. But I did talk to an officer who was on duty near the border between the two Embassies... ...who told me that not a single person crossed the boundary during the incident. Edgeworth: I see. Gumshoe: The investigations into the fire and the Yatagarasu are a mess thanks to both events! I'm so confused, sir! Should I be putting the fire out or investigating!? What do you think, sir!? Edgeworth: ...Aren't you old enough to solve your own problems yet, Detective? The investigation Edgeworth: I'd like an update on how the investigation is going. Gumshoe: Oh, yeah... Well... it's going, sir! Edgeworth: In other words... ...no one has any idea of what happened here, correct? Gumshoe: To put it simply... yeah, you got it, sir. But! We do know that something happened in this room, sir! Edgeworth: Any moron with a pair of eyes can see what happened, Detective. Gumshoe: Aww... W-Well, anyway! Let's investigate every single nook and cranny in this room, sir! We have to get serious, or Kay will end up getting arrested as the killer! Edgeworth: Yes, I am already well aware of that. Gumshoe: Oh... Edgeworth: (In order to find out what really happened here in this room... ...we will need to gather whatever information we can. It's time to take a good look.) The crime scene (appears after clearing \"Yatagarasu\" Talk option with Franziska von Karma and examining knife near body, key on body, safe, and butterfly on wall) Gumshoe: It looks like all that's left is a bunch of burnt stuff... But, well, I guess we've got all the info we need now, huh, sir? Edgeworth: Yes, it would appear so. Gumshoe: But you know, after all is said and done... ...I still have no idea of what's going on! Nope! Not a clue, sir! I just can't figure it out... Edgeworth: Hmph... Detective Gumshoe. It's nothing to get so worked up over. Gumshoe: Oh! You mean I should use that thing, right!? Umm... Defunction? No, that's not it. Projection? No, no, that's not it either. I think it sounded like... Oh, I've got it! \"Lock it\"! Edgeworth: ...It's \"logic\", Detective. Logic. (Now that I've collected some information, the next step... ...is to connect a few of them together to see if I can make sense of this mess!) Present Prosecutor's Badge Gumshoe: Hey, it's your Prosecutor's Badge! This thing's really important, right? So what would happen if you lost it, sir? Edgeworth: Why are you asking me such an ominous question? Gumshoe: Well, because I've lost my police badge before, sir! I just wanted to tell you to be careful, sir! Because writing the explanation section on those requisition forms is really annoying! Edgeworth: (I believe SOMEONE needs to listen to his own advice a bit more often...) Yatagarasu's Key Gumshoe: Hmm... So this is the Yatagarasu's Key, huh? That's a really nifty trick they built into it. I can't stop playing with it! This is great! It's like one of those transforming toys, sir! Edgeworth: E-Evidence is not meant to entertain, Detective! Anything else Edgeworth: What do you notice about this piece of evidence, Detective? Gumshoe: Umm... Well, uh... I don't really sense anything special about it... But the embassy is a different story! Edgeworth: .........I see. Gumshoe: ...I'm not really sensing anything special from you either, sir... Edgeworth: Well, I'm sensing a special look at your monthly salary, Detective! After connecting \"Locked safe\" and \"Key used at Embassy\" Logic: Edgeworth: We know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy. Furthermore, we found it in the victim, Mr. Coachen's pocket. Which leads me to think that perhaps it is the key to the personal safe in this office. Gumshoe: Good thinking, sir! Let's go try it out! Edgeworth: ...It appears I was correct. (The key that was left to us in the victim's pocket... It literally turned out to be the key to the next piece of the truth!) Hmm... What do we have here? Gumshoe: Hey! There's nothing inside! D-Do you think the Yatagarasu made off with everything, sir? Edgeworth: No, Detective, I believe all we need is a closer look. Leads to examination of safe Examine Safe Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Piece of paper Leads to: \"What is this here?\" Oddly shaped hole Gumshoe: Hey, there's a hole here, sir. Edgeworth: (It's a little too oddly shaped for a latch hole...) Gumshoe: Wow, that's a funny shape for a latch hole, huh? It's shaped kinda... like a star, don't you think, sir!? Edgeworth: Detective, I would hardly call that shape a star... (There must be some reason for this hole...) Gumshoe: Well, there's gotta be some reason why this hole's shaped so weirdly, you know!? Edgeworth: (Am I over thinking this? No, I don't think so...) Gumshoe: Hmm, maybe I'm over thinking things? Nah, there's no way I could ever do that, ho ho! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, could you please be quiet for a second? You're frightening me. Inside of safe Gumshoe: It looks like such a serious safe, but there's not a scrap of paper inside... Which reminds me, the safe in your office is just as empty, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: It's merely a coincidence that both safes are empty, Detective. Gumshoe: Well, make that a triple coincidence because my piggy bank at home is empty, too... Edgeworth: I don't think there's anything coincidental about that, Detective. Edgeworth: What is this here? Gumshoe: It looks like the ripped corner of a piece of paper, sir. Edgeworth: No, I don't think it's ripped; it seems more, to me, like it's stuck in the safe. Gumshoe: Hey, you're right! It won't budge an inch, not even when I tug on it! But I don't think I've ever seen paper stuck on the inside of a safe before... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Detective, I think you have it backwards. It's not the paper that's strange... It's the safe. Gumshoe: What do you mean? Edgeworth: What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that... it has two compartments. Leads to: \"Even just eye-balling it, you can see that the inside is a bit too shallow.\" it's completely empty. Edgeworth: There is nothing in the safe. Gumshoe: Well, yeah, there's nothing in the safe... but what's that got to do with anything? Edgeworth: Hmph... Why is the safe here in the first place? Gumshoe: Umm... To keep really important things safe, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, precisely. However, there is nothing inside this safe... ...which points us to a clear contradiction of facts! Gumshoe: .........But remember when we checked out your safe that time, and you answered... Edgeworth: Right now? Nothing. Gumshoe: ...when I asked you what was inside? Wouldn't that count as a contradiction, too, then? Edgeworth: Arngh! (I suppose there are times when there just isn't anything that needs to be safeguarded. Alright, time to recollect my thoughts...) Leads back to: \"What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that...\" it has a crack there. Edgeworth: Hmph... It is just as it appears to be. There is a crack in the safe, from where the lodged piece of paper is protruding! Gumshoe: Yeah, that's exactly what it looks like, alright. Edgeworth: Nngh... Franziska: We already know, so there's no reason for you to state the obvious so confidently, Miles. Edgeworth: N...Nngh... Gumshoe: Hey, I feel like I'm a step closer to understanding what it's like to be Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Drat... It appears the only thing I managed to do here is waste time.) Th-That wasn't what I had meant to say! The paper is sticking out, and that in itself is an important fact. So... Leads back to: \"What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that...\" Edgeworth: Even just eye-balling it, you can see that the inside is a bit too shallow. Furthermore, with the unnatural way the paper is stuck at the back of the safe... ...I'd say that there is an extra bit of space behind the back wall of this safe! In other words, this safe has a second compartment. Gumshoe: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? Franziska: I suppose that you are correct in asserting that the paper is stuck in an unnatural manner. However, if what you say is correct and there is a second compartment... ...how do we go about opening the door to it then? As you can see, there is no other lock or keyhole in sight. Edgeworth: Actually, there is one more spot of interest to me on this safe. Franziska: Oh? Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe that spot is the keyhole to our mystery second lock! Franziska: The safe and its locks... Alright then, since you are so sure of yourself, show me how you deduced your answer! Leads to examination of safe Examine Safe Examine Piece of paper Franziska: I suppose that you are correct in asserting that the paper is stuck in an unnatural manner. However, if what you say is correct and there is a second compartment... ...how do we go about opening the door to it then? As you can see, there is no other lock or keyhole in sight. Edgeworth: Actually, there is one more spot of interest to me on this safe. Franziska: Oh? Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe that spot is the keyhole to our mystery second lock! Franziska: Alright then, since you are so sure of yourself, show me how you deduced your answer! Deduce oddly shaped hole Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Yatagarasu's Key Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Doesn't the shape of this keyhole remind you of something, Franziska?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence is the key to the safe! Franziska: I'm not entirely convinced it is... ...but I'm willing to entertain any explanation you may have. Edgeworth: Ack! Gumshoe: Don't worry, sir! I'm sure you're right in what you said! Although... I'm not quite sure how that piece of evidence is related to the safe either... Edgeworth: Arrngh... (It's bad enough for Franziska to doubt me, but Detective Gumshoe as well!? I must remain calm, and examine this safe once more for a clue on how to open it!) Leads to examination of safe Edgeworth: Doesn't the shape of this keyhole remind you of something, Franziska? Franziska: The shape? It does look very familiar... However, I believe it's simply a latch hole for the safe's lock mechanism. It's just for keeping the door shut, nothing more. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that so? The person who used this safe... ...Mr. Coachen, made sure this safe had two compartments, in order to hide something. Do you honestly think someone like that would allow the keyhole to the hidden half... ...to look so obviously like a keyhole that even the average person could figure it out? Franziska: ! ...You can't be serious...! Are you saying that this hole is the keyhole to the hidden compartment of this safe? Edgeworth: That's precisely what I'm saying. Franziska: ...! Edgeworth: And I will prove to you right now... ...that the Yatagarasu's Key is the key that will open it! Franziska: Franziska: The Yatagarasu's Key!? Miles Edgeworth! This had better be a very bad joke! Edgeworth: Sorry, but this is no joke. The Yatagarasu's Key... ...is the very key that will open the second compartment of this safe. Franziska: We know that this key opens the first compartment of the safe. But the keyhole you're talking about... ...is of an entirely different shape than that of the key! Leads to examination of Yatagarasu's Key Examine button in handle, then blade Leads to: \"Let's go over this again, shall we?\" Edgeworth: Let's go over this again, shall we? The Yatagarasu's Key... ...was originally made to open Mr. Coachen's safe in the Cohdopian Embassy. We confirmed that as fact by opening the door to his safe with it. Now, let's take a look at the back end of the key. Looking at the knife portion head on, what do you see? Franziska: What are you talking... Aaah! Edgeworth: It appears that you've come to understand what I'm talking about. When viewed head-on, the knife's blade is the exact same shape as the keyhole! The real function of the knife portion is to act as the key to the hidden portion of the safe. Franziska: B-But that's... preposterous! Edgeworth: Because it looks like a knife and was used like one to kill Mr. Faraday seven years ago... ...we fell under the misconception that it was always meant to be a knife. But for both the safe and its key to conceal such clever tricks... ...whatever is hidden inside the secret section must be of incredible importance. Franziska: .........Then, it's even possible that what I've been searching for is inside! Scruffy! Hurry up and open that safe! Gumshoe: Eeeek! Y-Yes, sir! Opening it now, sir! Edgeworth: These items... They're...! Gumshoe: It's a bunch of funny-shaped things. I guess they're pieces of art, huh, siiiiir!? Franziska: You're in the way! Now, move, Scruffy! Gumshoe: I didn't think I was in the way... *sniffle* Franziska: These pieces of art...! They're identical to ones that have been stolen from various countries around the world! Edgeworth: I figured as much... These are the treasures this section of the safe was to hide from view! Hmm... I believe a more thorough examination is required. Leads to examination of safe Examine Safe Examine Oddly shaped hole Edgeworth: It appears that we've found the key that the Yatagarasu... ...no, Ms. Yew stole seven years ago. Gumshoe: Since it was originally from this embassy, maybe she came back to return it...? Edgeworth: I don't think she's the type to be so kind as to do such a thing, Detective. Gumshoe: Umm... OK, then what do you think, sir? Edgeworth: (Calisto Yew... For what reason did she steal the key...?) Art pieces Edgeworth: These are pieces of stolen art from around the world... Gumshoe: I wonder how much they're worth? Especially this one... Eeeeeek! Franziska: Scruffy! Don't touch those valuable pieces of art with your filthy hands! Why, do you have any idea what would happen to you if one of them were to break? Edgeworth: (Is it just me, or did she hit one of the pieces of art just now...?) Papers Edgeworth: This is the document that we thought was stuck earlier. I wonder what it's about? Gumshoe: Beats me, sir! Edgeworth: Why don't we take a look at it first before we give up, Detective? Mr. Coachen's name is written here on the last page. (I wonder what the significance of this document is?) Door to second compartment Edgeworth: To build this sort of trick into one's safe is really something... Gumshoe: Yeah, it's neat how this safe has two compartments, but what's really impressive... ...is that at the other end of the key was another key! I totally hadn't noticed! Edgeworth: I wonder if Mr. Coachen was just paranoid or if he had secrets of that great a value. Gumshoe: Speaking of paranoid, I once sharpened both ends of my pencil. But then, when I went to erase something, I got all paranoid that I was gonna stab myself. Edgeworth: Please refrain from dispensing your special brand of unrelated stories while on duty. Gumshoe: Yes, sir... Deduce papers (after clearing \"Smuggling\" Talk option with Franziska von Karma) Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Cohdopian Paper Document Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Take a good look at these documents, Franziska.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I believe this piece of evidence is somehow related. Gumshoe: Oh, I see! That's just like you, sir, to figure these things out! ...But I have no idea what that connection is, so could you explain it to me, please!? Edgeworth: Very well. .............................. (...I'm not sure that I can explain it... I guess it's not related after all.) Gumshoe: Come on, sir! Hurry up and explain it to me! Edgeworth: I will. Eventually. Let's save it for another time when I have the proper time to explain it to you. (I suppose I should carefully examine everything one more time...) Leads to examination of safe Examine evidence Yatagarasu's Key Knife blade Edgeworth: This Yatagarasu's Key was originally made to open the safe... ....in Babahlese Embassy's secretariat's office. And whilst the blade looks like a simple knife at first glance... ...when viewed head-on, it's actually the same shape as the second keyhole in the safe. This key was stolen by the Yatagarasu seven years ago from the Cohdopian Embassy... ...which suggests that this was made while Cohdopia still existed as a country. Partner Notice anything? Gumshoe: I can't believe there's a secret door inside the safe... Guess the stuff inside must be really, really important! Edgeworth: Yes, they appear to be quite important. Gumshoe: The little figures and stuff... I wonder how much those are worth? Edgeworth: Knowing that they are stolen merchandise, I would say they are probably priceless. Their value is probably worth more than what you could ever hope to make in your lifetime. Gumshoe: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? You're kidding right, sir!? I-I mean, they're so small... Edgeworth: (Well, we're talking about purchasing it with YOUR salary, detective, so...) Gumshoe: Ok, then I guess those pieces of paper must be pretty valuable, too, right? Edgeworth: Yes, I assume so. I'm actually quite curious about them. (Even if they are not physically worth much, great care was taken to hide them. Which means they must be very important documents to someone. I wonder if the papers in the safe might be related to that other document...?) Edgeworth: Take a good look at these documents, Franziska. Franziska: It says that there are three pages in total, and yet, there are only two here. Edgeworth: Correct. Now take a look at the smuggling activity document in your possession. Tell me, is it not possible that your page was taken from this set of three? Franziska: Well, well... It certainly looks that way. Edgeworth: By putting our multi-part puzzle together, we seem to have arrived at an answer. And it seems that you have now found what you were looking for. Franziska: Yes, and with this, it has become crystal clear... ...that Mr. Coachen himself was responsible for the mass smuggling of Babahlese ink! Edgeworth: Babahlese ink? Franziska: Babahlese ink is a special product of the Republic of Babahl. However, due to a special reason, only a limited volume is ever exported. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And that reason is...? Franziska: That's classified. It's on a need to know basis, and you don't need to know. In any case, it seems that the head of the smuggling ring was our victim, Mr. Manny Coachen. Edgeworth: His base was in an embassy, thus, it was hard for both our country and his to interfere. Making it the ideal conditions under which to run a smuggling operation. Franziska: Argh... but it's so frustrating. I lost the person I was to rain judgment down upon with my Whip of Justice. Edgeworth: Well, even if he is dead, we still have a responsibility to look into his misdeeds. Franziska: You expect me to whip a dead man? ...Well, I'm not interested. Edgeworth: Franziska... You must know... ...that Manny Coachen was the suspect in the KG-8 Incident... Franziska: Of course I know! On top of being the head of the smuggling ring... ...there is the matter of what really happened in that case that needs to be resolved. Talk Colias Palaeno Present Cohdopian Paper Document Palaeno: I can't believe that Babahlese ink was being used in such an evil scheme... And if people were to find out, that would really tarnish the global image of Babahl. Ah, this is really bad. Really, really bad. Ooh, Babahl's in a bind now... *sigh* Edgeworth: ......... (Is it just me or do his words not match his facial expressions?) Examine Safe Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Papers Edgeworth: The existence of this document in itself is quite important, isn't it? Franziska: Yes, it proves that Manny Coachen was the ringleader of the smuggling operation. Edgeworth: I suppose it does. (It really does look that way, however... ...I don't believe this shows us all that he was up to. And in order to find the truth behind his dealings, we'll need to continue investigating.) After connecting \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\" Logic, and examining golden statue and knife rack: Investigation Complete Shih-na: ...Are you done investigating? Edgeworth: .................. Shih-na: You realize now, don't you? That this girl is the only one it could be. Now come along quietly, Yatagarasu... Kay Faraday. You are under arrest for the murder of Manny Coachen. Kay: M...Mr. Edgeworth! Please, you have to believe me! I didn't do it! I chased the fake Yatagarasu in here... and he... he was already... Shih-na: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'd like to help you reduce the number of mistaken arrests Interpol makes. Shih-na: ...What is that supposed to mean? Edgeworth: I believe I told you that Kay Faraday is not the culprit of this crime. Shih-na: ...Very well. I suppose I have no choice. I'll show you just how foolish your claims are! Testimony -- Why Arrest Kay? -- Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight. Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy. Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu. And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body. Edgeworth: Your reason for suspecting Kay is because you think she is the Yatagarasu? Shih-na: ...Exactly. But it isn't just me. She calls herself the Yatagarasu. Kay: Argh! Look, how many times do I have to tell you!? I was only out to capture the fake Yatagarasu! Shih-na: Imposter or not... it matters not. A Yatagarasu is a Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: Very well. Then I shall prove that Kay is not the Yatagarasu who killed Mr. Manny Coachen! Shih-na: ...Go ahead and try. Show me what the prosecutors of this country are made of. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: They may have confirmed it, but are you telling me that no one could catch the thief? If so, you're basically admitting that the Yatagarasu that committed murder eluded us! Shih-na: ......... Of course, I chased after the Yatagarasu that entered the Babahlese Embassy right away. And that is also why I'm making this arrest right now. Because at the end of my long chase... there was only this girl. Edgeworth: Nnnghoooh! Shih-na: In any case, this is what I believe happened tonight. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The confusion caused by the fire...? Are you saying... that the Yatagarasu was not the arsonist who started the fire? Shih-na: A suspicious person in a long coat was spotted in the area. Officers in the area claim to have seen that person start the fire. Edgeworth: Hmph... It sounds like we have a phantom in our midst. Gumshoe: Umm... Yeah... Edgeworth: (In a way... he could be considered a phantom, with the way he randomly appears.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because she calls herself that, it doesn't prove that she is a killer. Shih-na: No, but it does give her a motive. The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" Furthermore, there are documents pertaining to some smuggling activity in this room. She obviously wanted to steal them... ...so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Edgeworth: I see... (Her logic is very sound. I expected nothing less of Agent Lang's secretary. However, that statement just now didn't sound right. It might just be the opening I need.) Adds statement \"She wanted to steal documents regarding smuggling, so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because she calls herself that, it doesn't prove that she is a killer. Shih-na: No, but it does give her a motive. The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" Furthermore, there are documents pertaining to some smuggling activity in this room. She obviously wanted to steal them... ...so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Edgeworth: I see... (Her logic is very sound. I expected nothing less of Agent Lang's secretary.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you're claiming that Kay knew that a foreign country's embassy had such documents? Shih-na: As stated in the calling card, the Yatagarasu was out to steal a \"dirty secret\"... ...which means that the goal tonight was to steal those smuggling activity documents. Kay: You have it all wrong! It was the fake that sent that card! Shih-na: ...Your words are meaningless. If you are truly innocent, then let's see some proof. Kay: Umm... Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! I leave it to you to handle this! Edgeworth: Yes, I'd rather you did. (The Yatagarasu's goal, huh...) Shih-na: You can claim she's innocent, but you can't change the facts I've already outlined. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I really don't think that being the first to discover the body makes her the killer by default. Shih-na: No, but if you saw the self-purported Yatagarasu standing in front of a body... ...wouldn't you get a little suspicious yourself? Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Even so... I'd still listen to what that person had to say before I passed judgement! Franziska: Hah, are you talking about yourself and those times when you were under suspicion? Edgeworth: I think the pain of being falsely accused is something you really should experience. Gumshoe: I, personally, know that feeling really well, sir! Kay: And given my situation, I now know exactly what it's like, too! Franziska: I'm fine with never experiencing it, ever. Shih-na: ...Are you done with your little group conference? Edgeworth: (So Agent Shih-na suspects Kay of murder simply because Kay is the Yatagarasu. But if I can prove that the Yatagarasu's goal is not related to murder... ...then I may be able to begin to reason with her!)Shih-na: Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: They may have confirmed it, but are you telling me that no one could catch the thief? If so, you're basically admitting that the Yatagarasu that committed murder eluded us! Shih-na: ......... Of course, I chased after the Yatagarasu that entered the Babahlese Embassy right away. And that is also why I'm making this arrest right now. Because at the end of my long chase... there was only this girl. Edgeworth: Nnnghoooh! Shih-na: In any case, this is what I believe happened tonight. Shih-na: Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The confusion caused by the fire...? Are you saying... that the Yatagarasu was not the arsonist who started the fire? Shih-na: A suspicious person in a long coat was spotted in the area. Officers in the area claim to have seen that person start the fire. Edgeworth: Hmph... It sounds like we have a phantom in our midst. Gumshoe: Umm... Yeah... Edgeworth: (In a way... he could be considered a phantom, with the way he randomly appears.) Shih-na: Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because she calls herself that, it doesn't prove that she is a killer. Shih-na: No, but it does give her a motive. The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" Furthermore, there are documents pertaining to some smuggling activity in this room. She obviously wanted to steal them... ...so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Edgeworth: I see... (Her logic is very sound. I expected nothing less of Agent Lang's secretary. However, that statement just now didn't sound right. It might just be the opening I need.) Adds statement \"She wanted to steal documents regarding smuggling, so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key.\" Press (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because she calls herself that, it doesn't prove that she is a killer. Shih-na: No, but it does give her a motive. The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" Furthermore, there are documents pertaining to some smuggling activity in this room. She obviously wanted to steal them... ...so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Edgeworth: I see... (Her logic is very sound. I expected nothing less of Agent Lang's secretary.) Shih-na: She wanted to steal documents regarding smuggling, so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key.

Shih-na: As stated in the calling card, the Yatagarasu was out to steal a \"dirty secret\"... ...which means that the goal tonight was to steal those smuggling activity documents.

I leave it to you to handle this! Edgeworth: Yes, I'd rather you did. (The Yatagarasu's goal, huh...) Shih-na: You can claim she's innocent, but you can't change the facts I've already outlined. Present Yatagarasu's Key or Cohdopian Paper Document Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Agent Shih-na. I regret to inform you, but there is a flaw in your logic.\" Shih-na: And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I really don't think that being the first to discover the body makes her the killer by default. Shih-na: No, but if you saw the self-purported Yatagarasu standing in front of a body... ...wouldn't you get a little suspicious yourself? Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Even so...

But if I can prove that the Yatagarasu's goal is not related to murder... ...then I may be able to begin to reason with her!) Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na. I regret to inform you, but there is a flaw in your logic. Shih-na: Oh? Edgeworth: Even if you claim that she is the killer, and the Yatagarasu... ...I am certain that securing the smuggling documents is not the motive behind the murder! The key to the safe in this room was found on Mr. Coachen's body. Furthermore, the Yatagarasu would not be so stupid as to leave without the documents. Shih-na: .........! Edgeworth: By the simple fact that the documents were still in the safe when we looked... ...it's obvious that the killer's target was not the safe at all! Shih-na: Shih-na: Then perhaps she didn't know that Mr. Coachen had the key on him. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If that's the case, then why would she have needed to kill him? Because I can think of no reason for her to kill him if she had not known that fact! Shih-na: Shih-na: Need, reason... All of this is simply our conjecturing after the fact. It's entirely possible that she accidentally killed him when she was sneaking him. Edgeworth: .........! Shih-na: Perhaps she didn't notice the safe's second compartment before returning the key. Edgeworth: Arngh! Shih-na: But the fact still remains... that Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But you have no definitive proof that it was Kay who committed the act! Shih-na: Shih-na: ...Actually, I do. I saw her holding the knife she used on the victim with my own eyes. Edgeworth: Wh-What...!? Shih-na: ...Allow me to tell you a bit more about the evidence that will put her away behind bars. Testimony -- Definitive Evidence -- Shih-na: The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife. The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer was holding. I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim. The knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other. The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument. Edgeworth: Nnnnnrrrrrgh... Th-That is your definitive evidence...!? Shih-na: You see now that she is definitely the killer, right? Kay: No! Mr. Edgeworth, you've gotta believe me! I saw a suspicious person in a long black coat outside the Embassy, I swear! Edgeworth: And you came in here because you were chasing this suspicious person? Kay: That's right. I ran into this office only because I was chasing after that person... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the lights, but then... Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ???: ...Who's there!? Shih-na: This is... Shih-na: I came to this room upon hearing the girl's scream. And when I saw her holding the knife, I immediately restrained her. Edgeworth: So the object Kay felt by her feet on the floor was the murder weapon...!? Shih-na: I had the knife analyzed right away, but we failed to find anyone's (changed from [anyone] in the original release, correcting the typo) prints on it. Kay: But the suspicious person in the black coat who came into this room before me...! Shih-na: Shih-na: You continue to insist there was such a person, but if there was, where did they go? Kay: That... I don't know. But I know they came in here! Shih-na: Shih-na: That sounds like the desperate excuses of a suspected killer, not a trustworthy testimony. You understand, don't you? We can't trust this girl's words, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Gnnrk! (She has a point. Even if Kay's words are the truth... ...I must show that they are with some solid evidence!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I really didn't...! Edgeworth: ! Kay... Don't worry. If you didn't do it, then there must exist a way for me to prove that. Shih-na: Shih-na: Still not giving up, I see. In that case, try to counter my argument, if you can. Edgeworth: Don't worry, I can and I will! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Does this mean that you already have the results back? Shih-na: We have confirmed that the shape of the Babahlese knife's blade matches the wound. Please don't confuse the efficiency of Interpol's forensics teams with your own. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I won't if you don't underestimate our police force. And so we're clear, I'd hardly say your logic is sound, which you will see in a bit. Shih-na: If you can prove me wrong... please, by all means go ahead. Edgeworth: That has been my intention all along. Now, let us return to your testimony. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean to say that you saw Kay holding the murder weapon with your own eyes? Shih-na: I was also on the search for the Yatagarasu. When I heard that girl's scream coming from this room, I rushed over straight away. When I arrived, I saw that girl standing there motionless with the knife in her hands. Kay: But I already told you! I only came in here because I was also after the Yatagarasu! The suspicious person I saw came into this room! But when I entered, it was pitch dark. I felt something by my foot on the floor, so I turned on the lights, and then... Edgeworth: ...You found out that it was the murder weapon at your feet. Shih-na: How many times do I have to tell you? We can't trust the words of a suspect. Edgeworth: The only thing you'll accept is evidence, is it? Shih-na: That's the only acceptable way to counter an agent of Interpol on the scene of a crime. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... Do you have some kind of evidence that can prove me innocent...? Edgeworth: I think I do, because there is one piece of evidence I find to be a bit... interesting. (I think I need to carefully examine that piece of evidence again.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I ask that you please refrain from speculation! Shih-na: It's a sound hypothesis derived from the evidence. ...There's no room for debate. Edgeworth: Arngh! ???: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth, know that an ungraceful loss will not be tolerated, my subordinate. Now, rebut her hypothesis with factual logic. Otherwise, what was your investigation for? Edgeworth: Yes, you are correct. Thank you. Franziska: Heh... Helping a subordinate out with advice is the job of any good superior. Edgeworth: (She seems to be rather enjoying herself. But she is correct, none the less [sic].) Agent Shih-na, please continue with your testimony. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: About the three-piece set, is there really no other like it? Shih-na: Let's ask Ambassador Palaeno for more details, shall we? Palaeno: The knives are indeed special. They have the butterfly, the symbol of the Republic of Babahl, engraved on them. And because there are only three of them in the world, they are very, very valuable. Edgeworth: (The national symbol, huh? Well, the knives are covered in the butterfly design...) Palaeno: Along with the Allebahstian set, our respective countries only have three knives each. Edgeworth: I see... Shih-na: Are you satisfied now? If so, let's continue. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: No, I believe there is still room for debate, and I'll thank you to not decide that for me. Shih-na: I didn't decide anything for you. I'm merely looking at reality the way it is. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Are you sure you're not just viewing the facts through rose-colored glasses? Shih-na: ............ Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I think she's mad at you. Edgeworth: ...Perhaps. (But our definitions of reality are a tad different.) Shih-na: ...Are the two of you done chatting? Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na's proof is the Babahlese knife that Kay was allegedly holding. Gumshoe: Yeah... So, um, how are you going to prove that Kay didn't do it, sir? Edgeworth: If Agent Shih-na wants to suspect Kay merely because Kay was the only one here... ...then I must show with evidence that Kay couldn't have committed the murder! Gumshoe: Um, but do you have such evidence, sir? Edgeworth: Yes. There is one piece of evidence that seems very unnatural to me. ...And I believe it is my duty to point that out to Agent Shih-na.Larry: So you think that all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, I have been saying that for a while now... After all, if not for that, then for what other reason did you wish to go down that chimney? Larry: Larry: You can't say that without any evidence! That's against the rules, Edgey! Lang: Lang: Heh! Thanks for keeping the prosecutor in line for me, Mr. Suspect! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph... I have the evidence. And if you wish to see it that badly, I can introduce you two. Franziska: Ah, but it's not good to keep them waiting, my subordinate. Hurry and show them already! Larry: L-Lies! All lies, Edgey! Edgeworth: Well, if YOU wish to lie, then by all means, continue. Because I'm ready to expose your lie at a moment's notice! Larry: Arrrrnngh... Y-You won't get the better of me! Now, let's see... Present Letter from a Stalker Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry, don't even think about denying that you have knowledge of this letter.\" Larry: Well, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the smoke coming from the chimney really that thick? Larry: You bet! It was so thick, I had tears pouring out of my eyes! It was a mess! Lang: .................. Franziska: .................. Edgeworth: Hmph... I see. You do realize that you've just confirmed for us, your chimney escapade? Larry: What!? Th-That's totally unfair! Y-You tricked me, Edgeyyyyyy! Edgeworth: Hardly. You simply have yet to master how to counter this cross-examination technique. Larry: W-Well, what I just said was a slip of the... No, I mean, I said the wrong thing! Besides, isn't this what you really meant to say about what I did tonight? Larry: It was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not quite sure how you could mistake that actress for this lady... Oldbag: Ooh, Edgey-poo! Are you staring at me? Ah, are you finally succumbing to my feminine charms? Edgeworth: I-I should think that the Steel Samurai is the one who should know all about your \"charms\". Larry: Whaaaaat!? M-Meeeee!? Edgey! What are you trying to do to me!? Edgeworth: Nothing! Simply that the Steel Samurai and the Pink Princess are husband and wife. Oldbag: Aww, is my poor, little Edgey-poo jealous? Edgeworth: Arngh! I-If you could please drop that line of discussion right this instant...! Larry: But Edgey! I... I told you! I already have Mindyyyy! Edgeworth: Speaking of Mindy, exactly what kind of woman would you say she is? Larry: Larry: Edgey, are you seriously telling me you don't know who THE Mindy is? She's just like what her name means! She's super sweet with a great smile! I don't mean to brag, but she's one of the troupe's fastest rising stars! Edgeworth: Interesting... Lang: Lang: Hah! So you're saying a woman like that is what made you late to the speech? Larry: ...Huh? C-Curse you, too! Why is everyone out to make a suspect out of me!? Look, all I can say is this! I was late to the speech... Larry: Then, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I suppose you might be correct in a small way. Larry: Wh-What do you mean by that!? Franziska: Besides being a suspect in a murder, there are a few other things you are a suspect of. Larry: Oooonngh... Not you, too, Franzy! Oldbag: You tried to stalk me! But I won't let you intimidate me like that! Larry: Look! I already told you, Ms. Oldbag! I wasn't after you, I was trying to see Mindy... Lang: Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, can I just arrest this guy already? Edgeworth: .........I completely understand how you feel, Agent Lang. Larry: W-Wait! Pleeeease listen to what I have to saaaaaaaay! Edgeworth: If you have a serious assertion to make, then I'd consider listening, however... Larry: No problem! I'm gonna put all I've got into this, so listen good, OK!? Larry: But why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Larry... This is the final point you wish to make? Larry: You got it! I've called on all the energy I have and told it to you with all my soul! Edgeworth: In that case, allow me to take that soul and break it. Larry: Huh? Franziska: Yes. We'll stamp it under our feet until it's been ground to a fine powder! Larry: A-A fine powder...!? Oldbag: .................. Larry: Eek! Lang: If you really put all your soul into that, then you're ready for what's coming, right? Larry: I-In place of the honorable Larry, I offer my soul to you. Edgeworth: ...Larry... Come out from behind there and face this like a man! Larry: Y-You're scary, My Lieeeeeeege! Present Letter from a Stalker Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry, don't even think about denying that you have knowledge of this letter.\" Edgeworth: (This whole testimony is one giant confession of all that he's done tonight. He's practically begging me to show why he bothered to put himself through all of this.) Edgeworth: Larry, don't even think about denying that you have knowledge of this letter. Larry: H-H-H-H-H-Hey! Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Why are you showing that thing to me!? Franziska: \"Wéndy, I'll be descending on you from above tonight. Your loving knight\" Well, isn't that just romantic? Edgeworth: But you weren't able to \"descend on her from above\", were you... Mr. Loving Knight? Larry: Aaaaaaaaaaaarghn! I-I have no idea what you're talking about! I don't remember a thing! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You can pretend to be ignorant all you'd like, but it's written right here. This letter proves that you were not out to meet the old lady... ...but rather, that you were attempting to pay Ms. Mindy a visit! (What part of this letter shows that the person Larry had intended to meet was Mindy?) Present \"Wéndy\" Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Larry, I suggest you take up penmanship lessons.\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph... All will be answered if we simply look here! Larry: Really? Because I'm not sure where I'm supposed to be looking, Edgey! Edgeworth: Hmm... (My finger is apparently not as precise as I thought (changed from [thought it to be] in the original release).) You leave me with no other choice. I shall have to point you to a spot that even you can easily comprehend. Leads back to: \"What part of this letter shows that the person Larry had intended to meet was Mindy?\" Edgeworth: Larry, I suggest you take up penmanship lessons. That is... ...if you never wish to experience this level of embarrassment ever again. Larry: Wh-Wh-Wh-What the heck!? What are you talking about!? Speak English! Edgeworth: You wrote \"Mindy\" so sloppily that it became \"Wéndy\" to the average eye. Larry: ...Hey, stop picking on me... It's so embarrassiiiiiiiiiing! Lang: There, there. Isn't that what childhood friends are for? They're the best, aren't they? ...For punching. But that will have to wait until we're off of this crime scene. Larry: Eek! Edgey! Save me from the scary man! Edgeworth: Sure, if you're willing to make amends. Starting with your incredibly embarrassing mistake! Larry: .........That... That... That wasn't me! Edgeworth: Come again? Larry: It's a fake! Someone's out to get me, so they made that fake letter... ...to set me uuuuuuuuup! Franziska: Accept your defeat graciously! Larry: But... you guys are being so mean... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Penmanship analysis. Larry: What's that? Edgeworth: No matter who, all people have certain unique features to their handwriting. Ergo, all we have to do is compare the handwriting in this letter to a sample of yours... ...and we'll know soon enough who it was that sent this letter. Larry: I...I...I... I'll never write another thing in my life! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Tsk, tsk, tsk... It's no use, Mr. Loving Knight. For you've already graciously provided me with a sample of your handwriting! Present Steel Samurai's Autograph Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This autograph and our mysterious letter...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You remember this, don't you? Larry: Nope, But if you're giving it to me, I'll take it. Edgeworth: As if I'd give this to you! (Oops. wrong piece of evidence...) Hmph... A-Anyway! I don't need you to write anything for me! Leads back to: \"For you've already graciously provided me with a sample of your handwriting\" Edgeworth: This autograph and our mysterious letter... If we compare the handwriting, we'll know the answer to our questions soon enough. Larry: Gnn...nnn... Nnnnnnnn...! Edgeworth: Confess now, Larry... to your miserable failure! Larry: I...I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorry! I... I... I did it... It was me causing trouble again... I admit it. You hit the nail right on the head... Edgey... Edgeworth: (So, he finally confesses...) Larry: I saw the Pink Princess being carried around in a stretcher, and got worried, alright!? I wanted to go into Mindy's room, but the doctors wouldn't let me in. So what choice did I have!? It was the chimney or bust, Edgey! Franziska: Your mind jumped from the door to the chimney? What a criminally overactive imagination. Larry: Well, at least I was honest and wrote Mindy a letter, and stuck it under the door. That way, she wouldn't be so shocked when I came down through the chimney! Edgeworth: (Except for the fact that the letter was an utter failure at conveying said sentiment...) Larry: I'm really, really sorry... Edgeworth: Larry, you may be a shameful, good-for-nothing blight on the face of humanity... ...however, I always knew you weren't the killer. I told you to trust me... ...because, at the very least, I can attest to that about you. Larry: Edgey... You're... Aaaack! Franziska: We've lost a lot of valuable time because of you...! Larry: Owwwwwwwww! Franziska: In any case, I believe we can say that we now know exactly what happened. Mr. Larry Butz sought to climb down the chimney... ...not for access to the crime scene... ...but to enter the room of the elderly lady next door. Lang: Lang: Great job, Mr. Prosecutor. Although, I still find it a bit unbelievable that the two of you are friends. Edgeworth: .................. Lang: But the suspicion on that guy over there... ...isn't completely resolved yet, so don't get any funny ideas about running off, OK? Larry: Owwwww...w? H-Hey... What--? Edgey... What does the wolf-man mean when he says I'm not off the hook yet? Edgeworth: .........He means the murder weapon. Larry, did you forget? There are two layers of suspicion hanging over your head. Lang: That's exactly what I mean. We can't only rely on the words of the suspect, after all. We may have figured out where he was and what he was doing all night... ...but the blood-stained Samurai Sword that was left at the crime scene... As long as there is no satisfactory explanation for that... ...this wolf will refuse to ease up on his bite! Larry: Eeeeeek! Edgey! That guy... He looks like he's seriously about to take a bite out of me! Edgeworth: I'm well aware. And you should be as well, that this upcoming battle will be crucial. Lang: Thanks to the cooperation of our lovely bumbler... ...I've been dealt a very nice hand, and a sweet trump card. Looks like we're about to enter the final bout! Now, Mr. Prosecutor! Let's see what you've got! Edgeworth: (I can easily point out the contradiction in the supposed \"murder weapon\"... ...but the real problem for me is figuring out what the real murder weapon is. This will be a high-stakes gamble! But this is one game I can't afford to lose!) Argument -- Why Larry? -- Lang: I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II. Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood. It was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead. Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too. Edgeworth: Isn't it a bit far-fetched to accuse someone simply on the basis of ownership? Lang: But this owner wanted to sneak onto the crime scene. I think that's plenty to go on, don't you? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you're alluding to his reason for being by the chimney, we've already established that! Lang: Lang: Hold on there, Mr. Prosecutor. You two are long-time friends, right? Who's to say you didn't fabricate the evidence to give him an alibi? Edgeworth: .........You're accusing me of fabricating evidence? Lang: You think I can believe anything you produce? Forging evidence is all you prosecutors do! Edgeworth: .........! (This man has some serious issues with prosecutors...) Larry: But come on, I can't think up something as complicated as that! Right, Edgey!? Edgeworth: Larry, I can agree because I know you and your personality well. However, Agent Lang knows nothing about you... or me, for that matter. (I sense his hatred for my entire profession emanating from his entire being. Meaning that the only way I can prove Larry's innocence is to present irrefutable evidence.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were the first to discover the body this time... Lang: \"This time\"...? What's that supposed to mean!? You'd better watch what you say! Edgeworth: I only said \"this time\" because earlier, Kay was the first to discover the body in Babahl... ...and your secretary, Agent Shih-na, was ready to accuse her of murder for that. Lang: Lang: Hah! So are you going to use that excuse to call me \"suspicious\" now? Edgeworth: Of course not; I was simply pointing out the usual pattern with discoverers of bodies. Lang: But in the Babahlese case, there was proof that she was holding the weapon, right? Well, in this one, it's a bit different, since we know exactly where the weapon is. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Excuse me, but \"glittering red and offering up the scent of blood\"...? Lang: Do I have to spell it out for you? I mean the sight and smell of blood, of course! And according to the tests, the blood on the sword belongs to the victim. The sword was made to only be used on stage, so it's not sharp. But it is pretty weighty. It's certainly heavy enough to beat someone to death with. Which leads me to suspect that the victim was beaten to death with the sword. Edgeworth: Beaten to death, huh? (This last statement is too important to just let it slip by.) Changes statement from \"Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood.\" to \"Beside him was the Samurai Sword... covered in the victim's blood.\" Adds statement \"I suspect he beat the victim to death with that thing.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So the sword is covered in the victim's blood...? Lang: Yeah, the lab results confirm that the blood on the sword matches the victim's. But the sword is as dull as a vanilla envelope. It's just a stage prop, after all. Larry: The Steel Samurai is all about \"Safety First\"! So you can't use it like a real sword! Edgeworth: The Steel Samurai has spoken. Oldbag: .................. Franziska: The Pink Princess also appears to have something she'd like to petition to you personally. Edgeworth: ...Wh-What the Pink Princess would like to say can wait for the day after eternity! Lang: Anyway, my point is that even though the sword is too dull to slice with... ...it's certainly heavy enough to bludgeon someone to death with. Therefore... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: About this Samurai Sword... Have you received a report from forensics yet? Lang: They confirmed that the blood on the sword belongs to the victim. Edgeworth: Alright, but have they confirmed that the outline of his wound is consistent with the weapon? Lang: Tell me something... Do you see the dead body right there in front of you? So! If they were conducting the autopsy right now, shouldn't that body not be here!? Well!? Edgeworth: Hmph... I suppose so. (I guess they must still be investigating this room. Meaning that it's possible he doesn't know about that piece of evidence's true nature.) Lang: Anything else you'd like to chit-chat about? No? Good. Now let's continue. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Larry has already testified that he forgot the Samurai Sword here... Larry: Yeah! I was shaking hands with the ambassador in here, and I left it behind by accident! Lang: Lang: So what? You lied earlier, so who's to say that this excuse isn't just another lie? Larry: But I forget stuff all the time! Right, Edgey!? Tell him! Edgeworth: ...Why don't you tell him yourself!? Franziska: You see? What did I tell you earlier? No one will buy such a pathetically weak excuse. Edgeworth: Yes, well... I know that it's not possible to prove such an excuse as truth... Lang: And yet you offer it up as fact!? You're a worse person than I originally thought. Edgeworth: You are free to think what you'd like, however, I know that Larry is not the killer. Agent Lang, please continue with your argument. I'll expose the flaw in it soon enough! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because he is the owner of the weapon, therefore he must be the killer, is it? Lang: No. Climbing all the way up to the chimney is plenty suspicious in my book as well. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Regarding that, I have already drawn the truth out, and the truth is one thing I don't bend. Lang: Lang: It doesn't matter if it's you or whoever. You prosecutors are all the same. And as for me, prosecutors are the one thing I don't trust in! Franziska: Franziska: An agent who doesn't trust prosecutors? What are you playing at? Lang: ...Sorry, sis. But there are only two things I trust: my subordinates and evidence at the crime scene. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang hates prosecutors. But as long as he trusts evidence that has been left at a crime scene... ...then there IS something I can show him that he can believe in!) Edgeworth: (It's simply not possible that the Samurai Sword is the real murder weapon. So I should focus on proving that point to Agent Lang first.)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Kay Faraday\nDescription: Young girl purporting to be the 2nd Yatagarasu.

You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}.

    "cot": "Evidence 12 (Samurai Sword) is described as a weapon used on stage and is thought to be what killed DeMasque II, but it is also said to be dull and unsuitable to cut with. Testimony 3 by Lang states: \"I suspect he beat the victim to death with that thing.\" This is a suspicious claim because the sword is dull and meant as a prop, not a weapon capable of causing a fatal stabbing or cutting wound, and the actual cause of death described elsewhere is stabbing. Thus, Lang is suspecting the victim was beaten to death with the sword; however, the sword is dull and not consistent with the stab wound on the victim's neck. This is a contradiction between the evidence describing the sword and Lang's testimony about the cause of death.\n",

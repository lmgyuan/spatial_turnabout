I reckon... yer through bein' a prosecutor, right? Edgeworth: Yes... that's true, I suppose. (I'm no longer a prosecutor. However...) Kay: You can't stop thinking about what Mr. de Killer said, right? Edgeworth: Indeed... de Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Edgeworth: (This case isn't over yet... The person in the red hood who kidnapped Kay at Gourd Lake... And this letter from an unknown sender. Someone's schemes are at work behind this case...) Lotta: Must be tough havin' a case you just solved still naggin' at the back of yer mind. Well, I got some investigatin' of my own to be doin', so I'll be off! Kay: That's amazing! You've already decided on your next scoop? Lotta: What're ya sayin' there, missy!? Don't you be underestimatin' the likes of Lotta Hart! I've covered a lotta scoops, ya know? I always have an extra scoop or two up my sleeves... ???: S-Someone! Help! Kay: Yikes! What's that!? ???: S-Someone! P-Please help! Edgeworth: (Hmm. This woman is...) What's happened!? ???: S-Somebody's dead! A m-monster...! Edgeworth: (A... monster?) Lotta: I-It's a scoop! A scoop's callin' me! ???: Please follow me! It's this way! Kay: Has something else happened? Again!? Edgeworth: I don't know... At any rate, we should follow her for now. Kay: Eh!? These are...!? Lotta: G-Genuine hoofprints! Edgeworth: (Hoofprints? Impossible! No animal could be this large...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Look! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang...! Why is he here?) Kay: Ah! Someone's on the ground! Edgeworth: (It can't be... The president of Zheng Fa... Di-Jun Huang!) Lang: ........ Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Lang: ......Mr. Prosecutor. Didn't take you long to get here. Edgeworth: What happened? Lang: What... happened? Ha! That's what I'd like to know! Edgeworth: (It would seem that he's in a considerable amount of shock over the president's death. However... ...what exactly are these giant footprints...? And what could have happened to the president?) Lotta: It's a m... m... monster! Edgeworth: A... monster? Lotta: Yessiree! Lookie here! Ain't no doubt about it, these are clearly the footprints of a monster! On this day, mankind received a grim reminder: we live in fear of the Mighty Moozilla! Edgeworth: (Mighty... Moozilla...?) Lotta: This here's a scoop! I got myself a scoop! \"Man Trampled to Death by Monster!\" I reckon it'll be the top story in tomorrow's paper! Edgeworth: (What nonsense... There are no such things as monsters... Wait, it can't be...?) Huang: I am Di-Jun Huang. I have heard of your deeds. You saved my country from a great crisis. Edgeworth: The real assassin was you all along...! de Killer: That is correct. I received a request from a key individual... ...to take the president's life... Edgeworth: (That man... could he have...?) Lang: Hey, you! Were you the first to discover the body? ???: Y-Yes, I...! Umm, well. Edgeworth: (! Agent Lang?) Lang: Lang Zi says: \"First come, first suspected.\" You! Did you really just discover the body!? ???: O-O-O-O-O-Of course! Kay: Please calm down! You're scaring her! Edgeworth: (He does seem to have lost his composure...) Lang: Tch. Calm down!? How am I supposed to calm down? Do you know who's been murdered!? Di-Jun Huang... the president of Zheng Fa! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. This isn't like you. Lang: ! Edgeworth: When we first met, you had an army of subordinates under your command... ...and you boasted of having the highest arrest rate in Interpol. And what now? Did you forget the fundamentals of investigation along with all of your men? Lang: What... did you say...? Edgeworth: Instead of questioning people at random, you should investigate the crime scene first. Am I wrong? Lang: ........Tch! I don't need you to tell me that. ...I'll do a thorough investigation. Edgeworth: (Well. At least it seems he's calmed for now...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Let's investigate too! Edgeworth: Yes. Let us investigate. (Right now, I do not have any investigation rights, but until the police arrive...) Lotta: What're y'all sayin'? Ain't it obvious who dunnit!? The man behind it all is the Mighty Moozilla! Hm? Well, I guess it ain't the \"man\" behind it, more like the \"monster\" behind it, ya know? Edgeworth: Good grief... Could you please just try not to interfere with the investigation? Lotta: Shut yer trap! Yer the one who better not be stickin' yer nose in my business! I ain't forgivin' ya if ya mess up my scoop! ???: Umm... Excuse me. Edgeworth: (Hmm. It's the woman who first discovered the body. I feel like I've seen her before...) ???: You're... Mr. Edgeworth, right? Do you remember me? Edgeworth: Umm. Y-Yes. That case... from before... Kay: Huh? Do you know her? Edgeworth: Yes, I do. (At least I think I do...) Kay: My name's Kay Faraday! I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! Penny: My. You have such a cute assistant? I'm Penny Nichols. I'm an assistant at Global Studios. I'm in charge of the props and sets. It's nice to meet you. Edgeworth: (Yes, that was it... I once handled a case that occurred during the filming of the Steel Samurai. This woman was a member of the show's staff, and she was involved in the incident. I must have met with her on numerous occasions over the course of the case... ...but to be honest, I had completely forgotten about her...) It's nice to see you again. The fact that you are here must mean that this place is... Penny: Yes! This is sort of an outdoor film lot for Global Studios. They're shooting a movie here right now. I was the first to arrive today, to set everything up for the filming... ...but everything seemed strange... Those giant footprints... and that... d-dead body... Edgeworth: I see. We shall examine the body. At any rate, could you please contact the police? Penny: Y-Yes! Right away! Edgeworth: (I'll have to take the time to listen to her story later... First, let's examine the scene. There are many things besides the body that concern me. I'll need to examine every nook and cranny of this place...) (Connecting \"Stepped on by a monster?\" and \"Monster's head\" Logic leads to:) Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. I'm going to take my leave here for a bit. There's something I have to check... Edgeworth: (Agent Lang. I wonder if he's caught onto something?) Hm? ???: ........ ........ Lang: ........ ???: .....Move it. Lang: What'd you say? Guess you're just a brat with no manners. ???: ...And you're an annoying old man. Quit your yapping already. Lang: ! Penny: I-I'm terribly sorry! Come on, Shaun! Lang: Tch! Penny: Oh! What were you doing!? ???: .......Who was that? Penny: Someone from the police! Why'd you suddenly pick a fight with him? ???: Hmph. Kay: That sure was a tense standoff! Edgeworth: (He didn't budge an inch, even before Agent Lang...) Penny: Ah! Allow me to introduce you! This is Shaun Fenn. He's the lead actor in our movie. Edgeworth: (The lead actor... is this child?) Kay: Hi! I'm Kay Faraday. Nice to meet you! Edgeworth: And this is Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth. Shaun: .......Prosecutor? Penny: He's a pretty famous prosecutor, you know. Shaun: But he's not wearing a prosecutor's badge. Edgeworth: Gah! (He's frightfully perceptive...) Penny: Ah! Shaun, it's probably better if you didn't go over there... Shaun: ............ Edgeworth: (That's certainly not a sight a child should see... However, he is someone involved with the case. I'll need to speak with him later.) (Connecting all possible Logic, examining ground around the body, original Moozilla model and table, clearing all \"Talk\" options of Penny and Shaun, and talking with Lotta leads to:) Edgeworth: And with that, this portion of the investigation seems to be finished. Kay: So the murder weapon really is... Edgeworth: Yes. As it stands now, the possibility that it was the monster head is quite high. Kay: So he ended up being squashed by the falling head, huh... Edgeworth: Hm? Lang: Although they're extremely late to the party, the bodyguards and the police have finally arrived. Bodyguard: Mr. President! Lang: They really were... far too late. Bodyguard: Damn it! Who did this!? Lang: ...They'll pay for this. I swear I'll make them pay. But you know, this much is enough to put me at ease. The person who did this to Huang... ...I've already got my eye on a suspect. Edgeworth: What? What do you mean? Lang: Even though Huang was the victim, he doesn't have extraterritorial rights here. Your country's police have the right to investigate. However, I've already spoken with them. As an agent of Interpol, they're letting me assist in the investigation... Edgeworth: ...So they've already established a plan for this investigation? Lang: I've already found my prey. Now it's time for the hunt... ...Take a look at this. It's a printout from a security camera on the Grand Tower rooftop. Edgeworth: Th... This is! Lang: This camera records people as they get off the rooftop elevator. And guess who was recorded? The president and his killer can be clearly seen! Kay: Wh-Why is Ms. Gravelle there!? Edgeworth: (So he's saying Judge Gravelle is the murder?) Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste! Edgeworth: (Could she, who hates crime more than anyone, have...?) Security Camera Photo jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. I'd like to hear your thoughts. Lang: Lang: ............ Just now, I heard a rumor at the Grand Tower. Miles Edgeworth, that you... are no longer a \"prosecutor\". Edgeworth: ! Lang: Naturally, that means you don't even have a shred of investigate authority. So what would be the point of having a logic battle with someone like you? Edgeworth: (Hmph...!) Kay: Why would you say something like that!? Didn't you also just get reduced to being a lone agent!? Lang: .......... Hey. Answer me this. Even though you've lost your position as a \"prosecutor\"... ...why are you sticking your neck into this case? Edgeworth: ........ (Why do I still continue to investigate...?) Agent Lang... Why are you pursuing the criminal who murdered the president? Because you're an Interpol agent? Lang: .......... Edgeworth: Right now, I am also chasing after a certain person. Someone in the shadows, who was behind the murder at the Grand Tower yesterday... Someone who placed Kay in grave danger. ...Even now, they are lurking somewhere, laughing at us. We will uncover the truth, and bring them to justice... ...and a title such as \"prosecutor\" has nothing to do with it. As long as the truth remains hidden... ...I will continue to seek out that truth. For that is a part of my creed. Lang: ........Haha! You... You're always trying to be so clever, but you really are kind of an idiot. Edgeworth: (Hmph. Me, an idiot? How rude...) Lang: That's the answer I wanted to hear. ...Alright, I'll play along with you for a bit. I've lost all my men, and you've lost your title. And yet, we still continue to investigate... Let's begin this battle of logic between two kindred spirits! Edgeworth: You have my thanks... Lang: However, I won't go easy on you. I'll definitely catch the criminal who murdered Huang. And I won't let you get in my way! Edgeworth: Yes... I wouldn't have it any other way! Lang: Let me show you the truth that this wolf has sunk his fangs into! Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower. Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president! Edgeworth: It was just the two of them alone on the rooftop... No bodyguards? Lang: Yeah. I confirmed it with those bodyguards over there. They didn't know about it either. Guess he managed to give them the slip. He must've had something secret to talk about. Edgeworth: (President Huang and Judge Gravelle... Did those two have some sort of connection?) Lang: Apparently, he had an arrangement with the owner of the Grand Tower. He requested the entrance to the viewing platform be restricted so that they could be alone. Well, it's not like the owner could turn down a request from the president. Kay: Does that mean... the last person to see the president was... Lang: Exactly... Gravelle, you mean? It's gotta be her! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang's reasoning is certainly sound... However, he has overlooked one major thing...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower. Lang: Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. Lang: At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. Lang: There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang has overlooked something major...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Edgeworth: Shi-Long Lang... For the Interpol agent with the highest arrest rate to have fallen so low. Lang: What'd you say...!? Edgeworth: This is a commemorative photo taken by the staff at Global Studios. Kay: Everyone's got such great smiles! ...Well, except for Shaun. Edgeworth: This photo was taken yesterday. Lang: What!? Edgeworth: If Judge Gravelle had murdered the president two days ago... ...then his body should have been there when this photo was taken! Lang: Owwoooooooh! Lang: Heh. Perhaps you should have listened a bit more carefully to those involved in the case. Questioning witnesses is one of the basic fundamentals of an investigation, is it not? Kay: I've captured Mr. Edgeworth's great smile! You really do look most alive when you're cornering your opponent! Lang: Grr... Just as I expected. It's been a while since I've felt like this. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, haven't you been a little hasty in your reasoning? Lang: ........Tch. I don't need your advice. Lang Zi says: \"The wrath of a wolf lasts a hundred years.\" My anger towards the woman who killed the president cannot be suppressed. Edgeworth: I, too, wish to capture the culprit. However... ...there is no doubt that the body appeared here last night. Therefore... the president could not have fallen to his death. Kay: Yeah! He was crushed by the monster head! Edgeworth: The crime occurred here at the film lot, not on the rooftop of the Grand Tower. Lang: Lang: So, that's what you think. Still, I don't intend to stray from my logic either. Edgeworth: However, he could not have fallen to his death two nights ago. This photo proves that... Lang: Is that so? Think about it this way... Two nights ago, Gravelle pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body. Edgeworth: In here? Lang: Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Once we search this area, we'll know where she hid the body. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Unfortunately, there is no need for a search. Lang: What'd you say!? Edgeworth: This piece of evidence proves that Judge Gravelle could not have hidden the body! Edgeworth: All the entrances to the film lot were locked. The chain on the back entrance was only cut last night. Lang: What!? Edgeworth: Therefore, Judge Gravelle could not have entered the film lot two nights ago! Lang: Aiyaaaaa! But the president could only have fallen two nights ago! Edgeworth: ...Why are you so insistent that the crime occurred two days ago? Lang: Why...? Because there's still more to the security camera footage. Lang: A photo was recorded 10–20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman. That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone. After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all! There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there? Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is! Edgeworth: The president never came down from the rooftop? Lang: That's right. The security camera is always watching the entrance of the elevator. It was specifically set up to record anyone who entered or exited the rooftop. Essentially, the camera created a locked room... one which the president vanished from! Edgeworth: (A locked room... I see. This is quite an unfavorable piece of evidence for Judge Gravelle...) Security Camera Photo data updated in my Organizer. Kay: A rooftop escape! That's a difficult feat! Edgeworth: So even the Yatagarasu can't just fly through the sky. Kay: That's right. I... I still need more training to be able to pull that off. Edgeworth: (Are you saying you're going to train yourself to fly?) Lang: A photo was recorded 10–20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman. Lang: That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone. Lang: After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all! Lang: There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there? Lang: Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is! Edgeworth: (A locked room created by the security camera... Is falling off the roof really the only way to escape this locked room?) Edgeworth: As a matter of fact, there was one. A hidden route... that is. Lang: A way down without using the elevator!? You'd better not tell me he flew off or something! Edgeworth: There's no need for that. It's quite simple. The president just needed to know... ...about the existence of the hidden 51st floor. Lang: The 51st floor? Edgeworth: This building has a hidden 51st floor. It is accessible through a secret hatch on the rooftop. Using that route, it would be possible to leave the rooftop without using the elevator. Lang: Lang: Hidden room? Secret hatch? How could the president have even known about that? Edgeworth: I wonder? I don't know the answer myself. I am merely raising a possibility. Lang: In the first place, what's this all about? This hidden 51st floor. Sounds like something that ninja girl over there would love to get into! Kay: No way! I'm sick of that place! Edgeworth: (For Kay, that place only holds bad memories, after all.) The 51st floor was a secret storeroom for the black market auction. Its true purpose was only exposed yesterday. Lang: ...Black market auction? You... You aren't suggesting the president was involved in something like that, are you? Edgeworth: I have no proof. However, the possibility exists, does it not? Kay: Hmm. I wouldn't put it past that president. Lang: HOOOOOOOOOOWWWL! Kay: Eek! Lang: Impossible! The president would never...! He would never be involved in a black market auction! Edgeworth: (Wh... What's this?) Lang: You punks. Are you prepared? If you're gonna spout nonsense like that... I'll tear you into pieces! Kay: Eeeeeek! Edgeworth: (...She ran away.) Lang: You don't have any idea! The amount of respect that man has earned from his country's people! Edgeworth: (I see... We have seen the president's true colors. However, the people of Zheng Fa remain in the dark... Should I inform Agent Lang of the president's true nature? No. Telling him now would only further cloud his judgment...) I understand, Agent Lang. Please calm down. We spoke out of line... I apologize. Lang: ......Sorry. My emotions got the best of me. And Kay, how long do you plan on hiding? You can come out now. Kay: ...I'm sorry. Lang: ...It's fine. My anger is directed towards the president's killer. Lotta: Well, I'll be! Yer actually a pretty good guy, ain't ya? That loyalty to yer president! It's mighty admirable! Lang: Heh. What's it to you? Lotta: Aww, don't be like that. I've got some good news for ya, I reckon. Lang: What? Lotta: The president ain't never passed through the 51st floor. Ya can count on me! Lang: Really? Lotta: I was in the storeroom myself, and I saw it with my very own eyes! Edgeworth: (That's right... She snuck into the storeroom that day.) Lotta's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer. Lang: ...Thanks. ...Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: What is it? Lang: I don't intend to give the culprit a single step of leeway. No one's seen the president since he met with Gravelle two days ago. Edgeworth: That doesn't change the fact that the body wasn't here yesterday. If he were pushed off two days ago, it would be odd that he wasn't found until yesterday. I doubt a fall from the rood would take a whole day. Lang: I'll admit, there are a few things I still haven't figured out. Edgeworth: Regardless... there is one thing I am certain of. Kay: There is? Edgeworth: What exactly occurred here last night? I'm certain we'll have to look into that in order to uncover the truth. Kay: Because the body and the hoofprints could have only appeared last night, right? Officer: Agent Lang! We'd like to bring the body in for the autopsy... Lang: Huang..... It's in your hands. Make sure you show the proper respect. Officer: I also have one more thing to report... Lang: What is it? Officer: We found some footprints near the body! Umm... They were left within the area that looks like a monster's footprint. Edgeworth: (There were human footprints within the monster's footprint?) Lang: What kind of footprints? Officer: Sir! They were the footprints of a child! About the size of an elementary school student! Edgeworth: What!? Penny: Huh!? Kay: A-An elementary school student!? Wait... Could it be...? Edgeworth: (Who... was that?) Penny: U-Umm...! Edgeworth: (Ms. Nichols?) Penny: I... I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you! Please excuse my rudeness! Edgeworth: Is there something you want to say? (What is she so scared of?) Penny: I'm worried that you'll think poorly of me, but... ...please let me testify something! It's really important! Edgeworth: (That's not something you need to be so worried about...) What is it? Penny: Last night... I... I actually came here. Lang: What!? Penny: Eek! Edgeworth: Why did you come here? Penny: ...Well, I got a little worried, so I stopped by... ...to check up on Shaun. Edgeworth: Shaun... You mean Shaun Fenn? (As I thought...) Penny: Yes. Last night, umm... Shaun stayed here late in order to practice by myself. Kay: Wow! He's really dedicated! Penny: Well, this movie is the first time he's starring as the lead role, so... ...I'm sure he wants to do his best...! Edgeworth: (She must have witnessed something last night...) When was this? Penny: Umm... If I remember correctly, I think it was a little past 10 PM. It looked like it was going to rain, and I was getting worried, so I came to check up on him. And when I got here... Well... I, umm... Lang: You... saw something? Penny: .....Y-Yes. Shaun was practicing by himself... ...and right above his head... I saw... a long... long... neck. Kay: A neck? Penny: Y-Yes! Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile... It was like... the neck of a dinosaur! Lotta: Whooooooahhh there! C-Could that've been... ...G-G-Gourdy!? Last time I went huntin' for it, it was a bust... but I reckon, this could be the real deal! Kay: What!? So this time it's Gourdy!? Penny: Th-That's right! I was really surprised! A-After all, Shaun is the boy who can communicate with Moozilla! Lotta: Yeah! That's right! Them horns of his lets him hear what the monster's sayin', right? Penny: E-Even so! He was looking up at Gourdy's face and he was talking to it! It was like they were friends! D-Doesn't that sound weird!? Lotta: You said it, sister! That's pretty darn strange, I reckon! That boy's a little traitor! Edgeworth: (...It seems she's gotten reality mixed up with the movies...) Lang: Hey, Missy... Did you really see that? Penny: Yes! But I was so shocked, I immediately ran home after that. Lang: What do you make of this, Mr. Prosecutor? Has another monster taken the stage? Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Do you really believe this absurd testimony? Lang: Hahahahaha! I couldn't care less about the monsters. However, it looks like who we need to talk to next has been decided now, hasn't it? Edgeworth: Shaun Fenn... He was here last night. It's very likely he saw something... isn't it? Lang: Atta boy! Lang: Shaun Fenn...! We've got some questions for you! ................ Penny: U-Umm... Shaun kind of left a while ago. Lang: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Kay: L-Let's go after him! Lang: Tch! Where'd he run off to!? Edgeworth: He might have just gone back home. Kay: That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today! Lang: ...Or he may have run away. Kay: A-Aren't you just overthinking things? Edgeworth: He's still a child. I can't imagine that he could have murdered the president by himself. Lang: Who said he was alone? Maybe that monster helped him. That boy can summon a monster to his aid, right? Edgeworth: Hmph. Very funny. Lang: I'm not saying that kid's definitely the culprit. But right now, he's the most prominent witness we have, So, we'll need to find that brat. Gumshoe: Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Kay: Ah! Gummy! Gumshoe: Uuugh... I, I... I...! Kay: He ran away... Edgeworth: (What is the detective doing...?) Lang: It doesn't matter... It's not like I can rely on this country's police anyways. Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. Do you intend to continue investigating by yourself? Lang: Yeah. That's right. You got a problem with that? Kay: Didn't you always have a small army of subordinates with you before? Lang: That's right... But, you know, being a lone wolf isn't all that bad. You don't have to worry about your subordinates or partners. All you need are your fangs. Simple, right? Edgeworth: (Subordinates... and partners...?) Lang: Well then. I'll be seeing you two. Lotta: He he he he. Things are gettin' interestin'! I reckon I'm about to get real busy myself! After all, I got me a pair of monsters to hunt! I'm definitely gettin' my hands on this scoop! Kay: Things have gotten pretty crazy, haven't they? Edgeworth: Indeed. There's the footprints of Moozilla, and now the shadow of Gourdy... It's almost exactly like the movie. Kay: How about we go monster hunting too? Edgeworth: Well... (Hm? Isn't that...?) Kay: Isn't that one of Lang's men...? Edgeworth: (He's one of Agent Lang's subordinates. We met him during another case.) Excuse me... MIB: Oh, Prosecutor Edgeworth. It has been a while. Kay: Shouldn't you be following Mr. Lang? MIB: Agent Lang... Shifu... is no longer my boss. Edgeworth: What exactly happened? MIB: Do you remember the incident from one month ago? Edgeworth: (The \"Yatagarasu Incident\" we had been involved with.) MIB: Agent Lang made a major mistake back then. He almost aided and abetted a dangerous criminal. Edgeworth: (Certainly... it had come quite close to that at the time.) MIB: Shifu took responsibility for what happened... and our team was disbanded. Kay: Disbanded...? Edgeworth: So that's what Agent Lang was talking about when he said he had become a lone wolf. Kay: Then... Why are you here? MIB: That's..... Well. I was a little worried about Shifu. ...It seems that even now, he's still chasing after them. The ghosts of 12 years past... Edgeworth: Ghosts of 12 years past? Just what are you... MIB: .......... I'm sorry. I've already said too much. If you'll excuse me... Edgeworth: (These ghosts Agent Lang is chasing after... Do they also have something to do with this case?) Kay: Looks like everyone's left now... So, what do we do now? Edgeworth: Well... Ms. Hart is going after the monsters, and Agent Lang is going after Shaun. We should also try approaching this case from a different angle. Kay: What angle would that be? Edgeworth: ...We should listen to what Judge Gravelle has to say. Kay: Ah! That's right! If I'm not mistaken, Ms. Gravelle is... Gravelle: ...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Fifi Laguarde's trial. Kay: She said that she had a trial coming up! Edgeworth: Indeed. Let's head to the courthouse as well. Kay: 'Kay! To be continued. Gravelle: Court is now in session. Is the defense ready? Ray: Of course, Your Honor! We can begin whenever you want. Franziska: The prosecution has been ready from the start, Your Honor. Edgeworth: Jill Crane, the attorney in charge of the defense, has passed on from this world. Furthermore, Sebastian Debeste, the prosecutor-in-charge, has disappeared... And so, Franziska and Mr. Shields have taken over their duties. Gravelle: Before we begin, I would like to apologize for the delay of today's trial. As the crime took place in the prison, a place where justice is normally administered... ...and the defendant was the warden of the prison, further exacerbating the situation... ...additional time was specially arranged to investigate and prepare for the trial. In addition, the defense attorney in charge of the case, Jill Crane, has recently passed away... Due to these circumstances, the trial was further delayed. Mr. Shields, Ms. von Karma. At this time, I'd like to give you my gratitude for taking up this responsibility on short notice. Ray: I guess this is the last job Gravelle-pie's friend left behind for us, huh? Well, Uncle Ray's more than happy to help out. Although having said that, I only had enough time to skim through the case files... Are you OK on your end, Franny-pie? Franziska: What kind of prosecutor abandons his own case and vanishes without a trace...!? I won't allow any more delays in this trial while we wait for that foolish man to return. I have received the evidence just now. There should be no problem continuing the trial. Gravelle: ...You have my thanks. And with that, I hereby call the defendant, Fifi Laguarde, to the stand. Laguarde: ........ Gravelle: Now then, will the prosecution please give us their opening statement? Franziska: Very well, Your Honor. The defendant... Laguarde: ...Please wait, Your Honor. Gravelle: What is it? Laguarde: Well, there's something I'd like you to fill me in on. Just what exactly... am I doing in a place like this? Gravelle: Then perhaps... you would do well to listen to the opening statement. Laguarde: Hmm. So if I listen to it, I'll get it, huh? OK then, let's hear it. Franziska: ...That was the plan from the start. Now, if you would kindly shut up and listen. The incident occurred in the detention center and the prison Warden Laguarde is in charge of. The victim is Horace Knightley, who was being held in the detention center. The prosecution is certain that this woman here is the culprit. This knife, the murder weapon, is the decisive evi..... Huh!? Gravelle: Ms. von Karma. Is something wrong? Franziska: Th-That's... impossible! The evidence is...! Ray: What's wrong with the evidence, Franny-pie? Franziska: The evidence... the knife's gone! The chisel with Kanis's bell attached to it is missing too! Ray: Wh... Whaaat!? Gravelle: Order! Order! Prosecutor von Karma. What is the meaning of this? Franziska: I... I don't understand it either, Your Honor. Laguarde: If there's no evidence, then I suppose there's not much reason for me to be here. Some prosecutor. Can't even hold on to one little piece of evidence. What a dunce. Franziska: I... I only received everything that the previous prosecutor had... Ah! Ray: ...It appears the culprit is that pampered prosecutor, the Boy Blunder. Hey, Gravelle-pie. Gravelle: What is it? Ray: Your Honor! Considering our predicament, what say we postpone the trial until later? Gravelle: Gravelle: The defense's proposal is overruled. Ray: Eh? Gravelle-pie...? Laguarde: I know, right? It'd be troubling for me if this trial were to be delayed any further. I just want everyone to know that I'm innocent. As soon as possible. Franziska: Franziska: Innocent!? I've had more than enough of your foolish... Laguarde: And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... \"In court, evidence is everything.\" Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor? Gravelle: .......... That is correct. Franziska: Eh! Ray: What!? Gravelle: The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Fifi Laguarde... Ray: Ray: Hold your horses, Gravelle-pie! You can't just declare her innocent all of a sudden! Gravelle: Is something the matter? For the defense to object to a \"not guilty\" verdict... Ray: Well, I mean... Even you must know that the warden over there is guilty, right? You were there with us when we found the murder weapon! Gravelle: ........ Mr. Shields. A judge must remain impartial when handing down a verdict. That is why I cannot allow myself to get caught up in my own personal feelings... The person who was present when the murder weapon was discovered... ...and the judge sitting before you now, are two completely different people. Ray: ...You're kidding, right? Gravelle: I can only hand down a verdict based upon the evidence that was presented. Franziska: Franziska: There is evidence! It's just... Well, it's not here right now, but... A few minutes, that's all I need! I'll find the evidence and return to court, without fail! The prosecution requests a brief recess, Your Honor! Gravelle: ........ Ray: Th-The defense would also like a recess, Your Honor. Gravelle-pie. Please... Gravelle: ........ ...I understand. I shall grant your request. Laguarde: Well! Verity-darling! Aren't you wishy-washy today? Gravelle: This court will now adjourn for a 15 minute recess! During with, the prosecution and the defense shall prepare for the resumption of the trial. Franziska: ...Understood, Your Honor. Ray: Phew. That was a close one. Gravelle: Court is now adjourned! Kay: Didn't we find it together!? The evidence! Edgeworth: Yes, we certainly did. Gumshoe: Huh? Edgeworth: What's the matter, Detective? Gumshoe: It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator. Kay: Really! Why? Edgeworth: (Of course, that's why the metal detector reacted!) Judge Gravelle, I'd like you to take a look at this. Gravelle: The chisel...? Debeste: Wasn't that just the fake murder weapon? Edgeworth: Kanis hid this chisel inside this dog's mouth. And the real murder weapon was hidden in very much the same way... Laguarde: ...! Edgeworth: The real murder weapon is in the pond, inside the alligator! Edgeworth: I wonder if it was stolen by someone... ???: Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Ms. Berry and Mr. Saint. Did you come to attend the trial? Regina: I came because I heard there's a really fun show around here! So, where is it? Simeon: The trial for the case I got caught up in was supposed to have already started, but... ..our practice ran a little late. I believe it was somewhere around here, wasn't it? Kay: Actually, two key pieces of evidence have gone missing: the chisel and the knife... The trial is in recess now. Sort of like an intermission. You just missed it, Simeon. Simeon: Wha... Whaaaaaat!? Wh-wh-wh-what's that supposed to mean!? Regina: Ah ha ha! Looks like Simeon's going to get arrested again! Simeon: Eeeeeeeeeek! Nowaynowaynoway, I can't...! Kay: Hmm. I guess Simeon is his usual noisy self. ...Huh? ???: To think that I would be humiliated like this! Edgeworth: ...And here comes another noisy individual. Ray: Now, now, Franny-pie. Let's just take a moment and calm down a bit. Maybe you could put that whip of yours away, him? Whaddaya say? Franziska: That foolish prosecutor! When I get my hands on him... ...my whip is going to give him the thrashing of a lifetime! Ray: Eek! Miles, why don't you try talking to her? Edgeworth: (Good grief... On that note, I guess I should probably hear what she has to say.) (Clearing all \"Talk\" options of Franziska and Ray leads to:) Ray: If only there were someone who could go search for the evidence for us... ........ Edgeworth: ........ .....Very well. I'll go look for them. Ray: Oh! Miles! You'd do that for us? Edgeworth: Of course, finding the evidence within fifteen minutes will be no easy task. Ray: Well, if worse comes to worst, Uncle Ray and Franny-pie will help you stall for time. Franziska: .......... Ray: Until you recover the evidence, we won't let her hand down a verdict. Edgeworth: Please do so. ...Franziska, are you OK with this? Franziska: .....You're asking me, Franziska von Karma, to help you out? You'd be better off spending the rest of your life as an anchorman for the local news... Ray: Ms. von Karma. This is an emergency. We could really use your cooperation. Franziska: ! Hmph... I understand. As acting prosecutor, I, along with that attorney over there, shall continue this trial. Meanwhile, you, the \"former\" prosecutor shall run around and look for the evidence... ...all for my sake. It's a job that suits you perfectly! Edgeworth: ...I'm glad that you're on board. Simeon: I-I'll help out too! ...'Cause I really don't wanna get arrested again. Regina: This sounds like fun! Regina wants to tag along too! Edgeworth: Alright. That would be helpful. Now then, where should we begin? Kay: I think we should go find that person, and hear what they have to say! Edgeworth: Who should we talk to in order to learn where the evidence went? Edgeworth: Yes. The person in charge of the evidence was Sebastian Debeste. Simeon: Ah, you mean that rookie prosecutor, right? Got it! Edgeworth: I'll leave him to you. Ray: Alright. Time for Uncle Ray to have a strategy meeting with the opposing counsel. ...Just the two of uUUAAAGH! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... You better not keep me waiting. Lest you end up like your friend here. Edgeworth: Yes.... I'll keep that in mind. Ray: Franny-pie, wait for meeeee! Edgeworth: Now then, let's go help look for Sebastian as well. Kay: Ah! Edgeworth: (Judge Gravelle...) Gravelle: ...If it isn't Prosecutor Edgeworth. I hope that all is well. Kay: All is NOT well! Just what was going on in that trial earlier...? Edgeworth: Kay! There's no need for that. Kay: But...! Even though Ms. Gravelle should know exactly who the culprit is... What made you...? Gravelle: ........ In a court of law, the only thing that truly matters is evidence... Whatever my own feelings may be, it should not affect the verdict. Edgeworth: So, is this the \"Judge persona\" of Verity Gravelle we're seeing? Gravelle: Cold-blooded and heartless... It's fine if you think of me as such. Edgeworth: (Even as a judge, she's still this stubborn?) Judge Gravelle. There's just... one thing I'd like to ask you. Gravelle: And what would that be? Edgeworth: Two nights ago... you went to the roof of the Grand Tower. Gravelle: ! The roof... you say? Edgeworth: You met with the president there, correct? The two of you were caught on the security camera. Gravelle: Is there some sort of problem with that? Edgeworth: Today... The president's body was discovered. Very close to the Grand Tower. Gravelle: Th-That's...! Edgeworth: You understand now, don't you? You're a suspect. ...What happened between you and the president up on the roof? Gravelle: Nothing... We merely spoke for a few minutes. Once our business was done, I headed straight home. I took the elevator back down alone. Edgeworth: Indeed. That was shown on the security camera footage as well. What exactly did you and the president talk about? Gravelle: Th-That... I cannot say. Edgeworth: (I see. However, I cannot afford to let up just yet. That being the case... Heh. I guess my only remaining options is to use that. She is definitely hiding something...! And I'm going to draw it out of her!) Edgeworth: Two nights ago, Judge Gravelle met with President Huang... Gravelle: ........ Gravelle: ...It is true that I spoke with President Huang on the roof of the Grand Tower. However, we only discussed business. There is no need to tell you what was said. Edgeworth: Hmm... Just like in the trial earlier, she won't reveal her personal feelings easily. When she's speaking as a judge, it would be better for me to wait and see what develops. Now then, I'll start by asking her what she talked about with the president! Edgeworth: Could you tell me... what you and the president talked about? Gravelle: My meeting with the president was strictly business. And since it has nothing to do with you, I am not obligated to answer your question. Edgeworth: ...... Gravelle: I appreciate your understanding. Edgeworth: Even so... You certainly are a very busy person, aren't you? You're a member of the P.I.C. and a judge as well. You even assist with the investigations. Gravelle: I am simply fulfilling the professional duties that have been assigned to me. Edgeworth: Was your meeting with the president also one of the duties assigned to you as a judge? Gravelle: .....Yes. Of course it was. I... am one who lives for the law. I would never act outside my professional duties. Edgeworth: This morning, you returned Kay's \"promise notebook\" to me. I don't believe that all of yours actions are simply done for the sake of your duties. Gravelle: .....It's true, it seems I still retain some immature qualities. Edgeworth: I wouldn't call it immature. It was your own personal kindness. Weren't you also distressed when you found out the president had passed away? Gravelle: Yes... It is very unfortunate... Why did he have to die...? Edgeworth: It seems he was crushed by the head of a monster called the \"Mighty Moozilla\". Ah... Excuse me. You see, Moozilla is... Gravelle: I-Is that true!? You mean... the president died at the temporary Moozilla film lot...? Edgeworth: Yes. That's right... I'm surprised that you know about Moozilla. Gravelle: Y-Yes... I had heard about it from Sebastian. He told me that the movie was being filmed near the Grand Tower... Edgeworth: ...She seems awfully shaken up about that. And I'm also curious about Sebastian, who went missing along with the evidence. She said she wouldn't talk about the president... However, I might be able to get her to reveal her secret through another line of questioning. She is flustered beyond normal. There must be some reason behind it! Edgeworth: Franziska may have taken over the prosecution in Sebastian's place, however... ...as long as he still possesses some of the evidence, the trial cannot proceed. Gravelle: I intend to carry out a fair trial. If the prosecution is unable to present evidence... the defendant must be declared not guilty. Edgeworth: ...... Gravelle: I am a judge. I cannot allow my own personal feelings to get in the way. Edgeworth: So, you're saying you're not the least bit worried about Sebastian's whereabouts? Gravelle: Of course... I am... I am worried about Sebastian, as well, but... Edgeworth: You're worried about Sebastian \"as well\"? Wouldn't that mean... ...that there is someone else you're worried about? Gravelle: Ah...! Edgeworth: By any chance... would that person have something to do with your unnatural behavior? Gravelle: ...That's impossible. I... ...I am a follower of the law... I will not... be swayed by... personal feelings. Edgeworth: It may be true that those who stand in court have a duty to follow the law. However, we're not superheroes! You and I are only human. It is impossible to completely ignore your own feelings and render an impartial judgement! Gravelle: Aaaaaaah! .....It is as you say. As I am now... I cannot hand down an impartial verdict. Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Why don't you tell me the truth? Gravelle: I... I...! Just what am I supposed to do...!? Edgeworth: For Judge Gravelle to become this distraught... I should find out exactly who she is searching for. Up until now, she has been wearing the mask of a judge... This time, I should be able to draw out her true feelings! Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: Earlier, when Moozilla was brought up, it seemed to be a sensitive topic for you... Is that \"child\" you spoke of involved with the Moozilla movie? Gravelle: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! H-How!? How do you know that...!? Edgeworth: You're usually so calm, yet you seem rather distraught right now. Please, tell me... Who is that child!? Gravelle: ...I understand. If you've come to know this much... I shall prepare myself for the worst. The child I'm searching for... is a boy by the name of Shaun Fenn. Edgeworth: Shaun...? Why do you want to know his whereabouts? Gravelle: Well... That much, I simply cannot say... Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Didn't you say you were prepared for the worst!? Gravelle: .....! Edgeworth: Even if you don't intend to talk, I am determined to expose the truth. ...That is my resolve. Why is she searching for Shaun... I must get her to tell me the reason. Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: I don't know what kind of relationship you have with Shaun... ...but at the very least, the two of you must be acquaintances! Gravelle: E... Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Won't you allow us to help you in your search for him? Gravelle: Help...? No, that won't be allowed? Edgeworth: Who won't allow it? The so-called Goddess of Law? Gravelle: ...The person who knows where that child is.. Edgeworth: I see... Finally, I've connected all the pieces of the puzzle. The reason why you cannot easily talk about Shaun... It was because... Someone kidnapped him, isn't that right? Gravelle: A-Aah... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: ...Judge Gravelle. I would like to hear the truth from your own lips. Gravelle: .....I understand. This time... I will truly be prepared for the worst. It is just as you deduced... Someone has kidnapped Shaun. Edgeworth: ! As I thought... There was a kidnapping! Still, how is Shaun's kidnapping related to you in any way? Gravelle: ......Shaun and I are... ...mother and child... Edgeworth: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? I was unable to learn much about the conversation she had with the president, but... ...I have learned of Shaun's kidnapping. ...It was an unexpected result, but with that... it's checkmate. Gravelle: ....... Kay: Whaaat!? J-Shaun is... Ms. Gravelle's son!? No way! I mean, he's already so big, for him to be your... Gravelle: Yes... Shaun is indeed my son. Please look at this... Edgeworth: (This is a clipping from a magazine...) Kay: It's an article about Shaun! Do you always carry this around with you? Gravelle: Yes. I always keep it close by. It's like a charm to me... Edgeworth: (It seems the bond that they share is a strong one.) Gravelle: ....... Edgeworth: However, are you absolutely certain that he's been kidnapped? Gravelle: Yes. I received a call from the kidnapper just before the trial started... Edgeworth: What were their demands? Gravelle: They had only one demand. A \"Not Guilty\" verdict for Fifi Laguarde... Edgeworth: (I see. So that's what happened...) Laguarde: And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... \"In court, evidence is everything.\" Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor? Gravelle: .......... That is correct. The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Fifi Laguarde... Edgeworth: So, that's why you were going to deliver a \"Not Guilty\" verdict earlier? Gravelle: I am... not qualified to be a judge... A judge must be able to remain impartial and composed, above all else. And yet... despite this, in the trial just now, I... ...I was about to hand down a verdict that was led solely by my heart! Edgeworth: .....Judge Gravelle. Gravelle: The Goddess of Law must be furious with me... ...but, I simply couldn't do it. I couldn't hand down a fair verdict... if it meant I had to sacrifice my own son! Kay: Of course you can't! Edgeworth: (Kay...) Kay: A real parent... would never abandon their own child! If that makes the Goddess of Law angry, then maybe the Goddess is the one who's wrong! The Goddess is guilty! Guilty! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Indeed. (To declare a goddess guilty...) We're responsible for upholding the law, but at the same time, we are only human. Nobody would hand down a verdict that would sacrifice their own child. Gravelle: .....Thank you very much. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth. However... I cannot simply run away from the courtroom. Bailiff: Judge Gravelle! So this is where you've been. Gravelle: It appears it's time... Kay: .......... Ms. Gravelle! ...My father, he was a prosecutor. Gravelle: Your father...? Kay: Yes. He stood in court, just like you. ...And now, with all that has happened, it got me thinking... What if, my father had been in the same position as you are now? Gravelle: If a prosecutor was being coerced into obtaining a guilty verdict... Kay: I know... if my life were on the line, my father... ...would definitely come to steal me back! Gravelle: Steal you... back? Kay: Ms. Gravelle. Why don't you let us take care of it? Gravelle: What...? Kay: I'm gonna go steal Shaun back for you! As the second Yatagarasu, I, Kay Faraday, give you my word! Gravelle: ...... Edgeworth: (Heh. So, the Great Thief Yatagarasu plans to steal the \"truth\", huh...) What say you, Judge Gravelle? Will you place your trust in our young Great Thief? Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth... Edgeworth: And, if it's alright with you, I wish to help as well. Gravelle: .....Thank you very much. I know that it's really not my place to ask this of you... ...but please... do whatever you can... Please save Shaun. Kay: You got it! Just leave everything to us! Gravelle: Allow me to leave my cellphone with you. You may get a call from the kidnapper at some point. Edgeworth: You have my word. I will ensure the safe return of your phone, alone with your son. Gravelle: And I will do everything in my power to prolong the trial. But... even then, at most the trial can only last for about two more hours... Edgeworth: (Two hours, huh... So, until 2 PM. That's our time frame...) Gravelle: ...I must return to court. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall leave the rest to you. Edgeworth: Heh. Kay, I thought you were taking a break from being the Great Thief? Kay: As of right now, the Great Thief Yatagarasu is back in business! Alright! Time to put on the gloves and hit the pavement! It's my first request, after all! Edgeworth: Is that so? In that case, we'd better begin our investigation posthaste... ...if we hope to track down Shaun... Lang: Tch! Where'd he run off to!? Edgeworth: He might have just gone back home. Kay: That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today! Lang: ...Or he may have run away. Edgeworth: We should probably begin our investigation from the front of the Grand Tower. Kay: H-Hey! Hold it, Mr. Edgeworth! You're not the one in charge anymore! From here on out, this is a job for a Great Thief! Which means, I'm the leader now! Edgeworth: ...If that's the case, then what am I supposed to do? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, you get to be... the first ever Great Thief's Assistant! Edgeworth: (So, I'm a thief's assistant now...?) Kay: Alright! Let's get going! The Great Thief Yatagarasu takes flight once again! Kay: Here we are! The scene of the crime! Let's get to work! Now, say it with me, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hm? Say what? Kay: \"Even in the depths of night...\" Edgeworth: .......... Kay: Aww, come on! Say the rest with me! Edgeworth: And just why should I do that!? Kay: Because! The Great Thief Yatagarasu has arrived on the scene! If we don't say the introduction, it just doesn't feel right! Edgeworth: I have no intention of becoming a thief. Kay: Aargh! Fine, then. I'll do it by myself! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: Yes, Kay. I know you are. I, on the other hand, am starting the investigation. Kay: Tch. You're no fun. Edgeworth: ...We don't have time for \"fun\". We only have until 2 o'clock. We need to begin making inquiries immediately. Kay: Good thing we have a photo, so we can go right ahead and start asking around! (Examining trailer after clearing all \"Talk\" options of Powers, blue truck, taxi, and film equipment and talking with officer leads to:) Edgeworth: (Hmm. It's already half past 12...) Kay: I wonder how Ms. Gravelle and the others are holding up... Edgeworth: How long will they be able to prolong the trial...? Kay: We gotta hurry and find Shaun! Edgeworth: Indeed. Lotta: Aww heck naw! That ain't how it's done! Ya ain't gonna catch a scoop like that! Nicole: S-Sorry, Chief! Lotta: What am I always tellin' ya!? We're beasts! Scoop-eatin' animals! It's scoop or starve! No story, no glory! Ya gotta get fired up! Nicole: Yessir! As expected of my mentor! Edgeworth: They're here... (It's those noisy reporters.) Kay: Hey, they came here too! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go talk to them! Edgeworth: ...Good grief. If we must. Edgeworth: What if the kidnappers stole the box? Kay: Ah! You mean they...! Edgeworth: Exactly. They took it in order to carry Shaun inside it. Kay: Shaun's a tiny kid, after all. Then, the reason the taxi driver didn't see Shaun was because... Edgeworth: It's likely he was put in the trunk as the kidnapper's luggage. Kay: But, why did they need to go through all the trouble of hiding him? Edgeworth: At first, the kidnappers must have intended to abduct him without being seen. However, they didn't anticipate all the policemen in the plaza. Kay: Ah, I see. If they tried to just walk away with him, they would've been spotted... Edgeworth: Just the mere presence of policemen would have been a sizable threat. Kay: I geddit! In that case, we've gotta ask the taxi driver! Edgeworth: Did the two men you told us about earlier have any luggage with them? Driver: Yeah. They stuffed a huge box into the trunk. Kay: Then that's that! Those guys must be the kidnappers! Edgeworth: Do you remember where you took those men? Driver: Sounds to me like something serious has gone down here... If you'd like, I could take you to the same place I took them. Kay: Let's do it, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes. Thank you for your help. Driver: No problemo! Just leave it to me! Kay: Uugh... That taxi drove way too fast. I don't feel too good. Edgeworth: ........ Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, are you alright? Your face is really pale. Edgeworth: I-I'm fine. The driver said they came to this house's garage... Kay: This must be where those two men brought the box! ...Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Look at the nameplate on the door! Edgeworth: Nameplate...? What!? \"Blaise Debeste\"!? Kay: So this is... the chairman's house! Edgeworth: (Does that mean the one who kidnapped Shaun was Blaise Debeste? Blaise should have already been arrested though...) Kay: Ah! The garage door is unlocked! Edgeworth: You really do have a good eye for this sort of thing... Edgeworth: (It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.) Kay: Excuse me... we're coming in... Anybody home? Edgeworth: Doing something like this, it's as if we're a couple of petty thieves...! Kay: Shh! Be quiet! Right now, we're Great Thieves! Have some self-awareness! Edgeworth: (...She scolded me.) Nobody's here... For now, it looks like we can get through this without being arrested. Kay: This isn't the time to be relieved! Now the real deal begins! Let's go look for treasure! Edgeworth: (We are looking for Shaun, not treasure...) (Examining the \"Cement bag\", \"Shovel and sledgehammer\", \"Gloves\" and \"Green box\" leads to:) ???: ...*thump, thump*... Edgeworth: Hm? Kay: Th-There's someone inside! ???: ...*thump, thump*... *thump, thump*... *CRASH*! Edgeworth: Is it... Shaun...? Kay: Shaun! We're coming to save you! ......Eh? Edgeworth: (Th-This is...!) You're..... S-Sebastian! Kay: Whaaaaat!? Why!? Debeste: Nnnnf, Nmmnnnmmf! Kay: This is Blaise's house, right? That would mean... Edgeworth: Yes. It should also be Sebastian's house. (So then, why is he...?) Kay, go help him out. Kay: If it has to do with ropes, just leave it to Kay! Here I go! A little pull over here, and a quick tug over there! Are you alright, Sebastian? Debeste: .......... Edgeworth: (He looks a little worse for wear.) Why were you tied up in a place like this? Debeste: .....How should I know!? Y-You guys don't know anything about me! Edgeworth: .....It's because we don't know. That's why we're asking you... Debeste: .......... Kay: He's completely shut off his heart... Edgeworth: Indeed... If it's come to this... ...I suppose I have no choice but to use that. Kay: Ah! You mean! Edgeworth: I hate to do this when he's in such a fragile state. It's like kicking a man who's down... Kay: ...Will it be alright? His mind might break if you corner him too much, y'know? Edgeworth: Yes. I am aware of that. I will try to be careful. (Good grief. I wonder how this will turn out... I've never held back against anyone before...) Edgeworth: After running out of the meeting room this morning, why would he be here of all places...? Debeste: You guys... You don't know how I feel! Edgeworth: (He's gone through a lot of shock. He must be on the verge of an emotional meltdown.) It can't be helped... At times like this, I must quietly listen to what he has to say. Debeste: N-No one tells me anything... I'm always the only one being left out like an idiot...! Edgeworth: (Hmm... I should try to answer his questions as best as I can.) Considering how fragile he is... I won't have much time to spare. I'll need to ask about his true feelings, and try to calm him down posthaste! Edgeworth: Could you please tell me what's on your mind? Debeste: I... I don't wanna! It's not like you'd listen to me anyways! Edgeworth: ..... Debeste: Wh-What's wrong? Normally, you'd be shouting \"Objection!\" right about now! Edgeworth: ..... Debeste: ...You're serious? Y-You're really... gonna listen to what I have to say? Edgeworth: I can understand... the shock you went through after what happened with your father. Debeste: It wasn't just Pops. This morning, I... I lost everything! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: E-Everything I have... was given to me by Pops... T-Tell me, Mr. Edgeworth... Just what am I supposed to believe in...? Edgeworth: If you can't believe in others, then at least believe in yourself. You'll need to gain experience on your own, but if you require wisdom, I can lend you a hand. Debeste: ! ...Ever since I got locked up, I've been thinking... ...am I too inculpable to be a prosecutor... uh? Incapable...? Erm, which one was it? Edgeworth: I believe \"incapable\" is the word you are looking for. Judging your own ability is not an easy task. Sebastian. Little by little, you are growing. Debeste: ! Edgeworth: Sebastian. Would you tell me your side of the story? Debeste: .....I-I understand. What... should I talk about? Edgeworth: Hmm. He seems to have calmed down slightly. I'd like you to tell me everything you know about the kidnappers. Now then... Tell me what you heard and saw! Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: Kidnapping his own son in order to demand a ransom wouldn't make such sense. Debeste: .....Y-Yeah, you're right! Edgeworth: Did you notice anything strange when you got kidnapped? Debeste: Oooh... As soon as I answered their question, they just took me away... Edgeworth: They asked you a question...? Tell me what they asked you! Debeste: Waaah! D-Don't glare at me like that... Erm... I think they asked me, \"Do you know Gravelle?\" Edgeworth: ! I see.. The pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall into place. Blaise... and the kidnappers did not intend to kidnap you. Their objective was Shaun Fenn. They were planning to kidnap Judge Gravelle's son... ...in order to have Fifi Laguarde declared not guilty! Debeste: J-Verity has a son...? And Warden Laguarde gets declared not guilty...? Edgeworth: I suspect... the kidnappers mistook you for Shaun Fenn. Debeste: A-All of this... was just a mistake? ! Wait... maybe that's why, back then...! Edgeworth: Hm...? Did you just remember something? Debeste: N-No..... It's nothing! I'm useless anyways... Just... leave me alone already! Edgeworth: Th-This is bad! He might be at his emotional limit...! I must get him to tell me what he remembered, and try to calm him down as well. Based on how distressed Sebastian looks right now... ...it must have been quite traumatic. I'll need to help him get back on his feet! Edgeworth: What did you remember just now? Debeste: I-I didn't remember anything... about Po... that guy... Edgeworth: Would \"that guy\" happen to be Blaise? Debeste: D-Darniiiiiit! Oooh... So this is the difference between me and someone who earned his Prosecutor title... Edgeworth: ...I've been waiting to ask you: Why did you become a prosecutor? Debeste: What does it matter!? I'm not fit to be a prosecutor anyways! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: S-Say something! Edgeworth: You must have some reason for choosing this path, right? Debeste: ...N-No, it's not like that! It wasn't anything special! I became a prosecutor for a really insignificant reason! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: It was just... a personal reason. Edgeworth: Heh... Just like you, I, too, became a prosecutor for a personal reason. Debeste: Huh...? I-Is that true...? B-But... you're a really successful prosecutor... I'm sure that Pops... the P.I.C. chairman... would have been more proud of you than me. Edgeworth: I see... so, you wanted your father's approval. Debeste: Ooh.....! I thought that if I became the best prosecutor, he'd be proud of me! That's why I...! I just wanted to help out Pops as much as I could......! Edgeworth: Would you... happen to be protecting your father? Debeste: Wha... I-I don't have any reason to protect someone like him...! Edgeworth: Didn't you want to help out your father... as much as you could? Debeste: Uuuuuunngh... Just once... I only wanted to be useful to Pops just this once! That way... I could help him regain his repetition! Edgeworth: You seem to be mixing up your words again... The word you're looking for is \"reputation\". Debeste: Huh? N-No one's ever told me that before! Edgeworth: Your father, who has strayed from his path, continues to add to his crimes... Even knowing that, do you truly want things to stay the way they are? Debeste: But... in that case, just what am I supposed to do? Edgeworth: You should triumph over your father, who has treated you like a fool. You must stop Blaise before he commits another crime! Debeste: ! I never thought of it that way. I... I want to triumph over Pops! Edgeworth: ...Somehow, it seems he has calmed down once again. Now's my chance to ask him about Blaise's secret! I will give Sebastian the courage to stand up to his father! Edgeworth: Hmm... He seems to have become unsettled again. I suppose I should lend him a hand... Edgeworth: The place you thought would be the safest... Would that have been in Blaise Debeste's hands? Debeste: Ungh... Waaaaaahhh! H-He told me that it would be safer if he took care of the evidence! Edgeworth: I'm sorry... but he has betrayed your trust in the worst way possible. Debeste: Pops... why would he want to hide the evidence...? Edgeworth: Blaise's objective was to have Warden Laguarde found not guilty, by obscuring the truth... Sebastian. You... were used by your father! Debeste: Ungh... Uwaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: It's possible that Blaise Debeste has the evidence with him. Furthermore, we still have no idea where Shaun is. I must return to my investigation posthaste, however... Debeste: This... This is all my fault...! What am I gonna do now...!? Edgeworth: ...Seeing him like this, I can't just leave him be. He is still suffering in the gap between his ideal and reality. He will never move on until he figures out how to live his own life! Sebastian is about to face his greatest trial. Perhaps this is fate. I shall give him the push forward that he needs. Edgeworth: For goodness' sake... Don't you remember your own words? Perhaps his \"own will\" can show him the way. Edgeworth: As a prosecutor... didn't you want to walk a different path from your father? Certainly, the path you have chosen is not an easy one. Nevertheless, you still chose to live as a prosecutor. In that case, it should be clear to you what you need to do...! Debeste: ! Edgeworth: ...I still question how I live my life to this day. But you, Sebastian... have found your own answer. So believe in yourself, Prosecutor Debeste! Debeste: I... WAAAAAAAAAAH! Edgeworth: (He was mistaken for Shaun, and kidnapped by Blaise's underlings. And after his father stole his evidence, he lost his confidence as a prosecutor... The emotions he is going through must be more painful than anything I could imagine.) It's taken longer than I thought... but with that, it's checkmate. Debeste: U-unh, uugh... ungh...! D... D-D-D-D... DARN IIIIIIIIIIIT! Edgeworth: .......... Kay: H-He dashed out of here at full speed... Edgeworth: (It seems if there's one thing he's \"the best\" at, it's running away...) Edgeworth: (Curses! We're running out of time...) We should check in with Mr. Shields. (I'd also like to know what the situation is like on their end.) Kay: But Mr. Debeste ran off again... Edgeworth: We'll just give them the new information we discovered. Franziska will take his place. Kay: Hmm... I wonder if that's going to be enough... Edgeworth: It can't be helped. Since he ran away, there's nothing more we can do. District Court - Courtroom No. 3 Ray: Eerm. I guess I'll just say it again. If there's no murder weapon, you can't prove the defendant is guilty. Franziska: Franziska: Just because we don't have the murder weapon, doesn't mean the defendant is innocent! It seems you wish to taste the sting of my whip. Ray: Gyaaah! Laguarde: Mr. Attorney. This trial... How much longer will it take? Because it feels like it hasn't gone anywhere at all for a good while now! Ray: Well, sorry, but that stubborn prosecutor over there just doesn't seem to understand. Franziska: Until I am satisfied... ...this whip will lash out at you as many times as I see fit. Ray: (By now, she's probably whipped me once for every year I've been alive... Miles... What's taking you so long? Even though we're just stalling for time, Uncle Ray can't keep this up much longer!) Whoops, 'scuse me. Phone call. Mind if I take this? Gravelle: ...I will allow it. Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. Ray: Oh, Miles, it's you. How's it going over there? Edgeworth: We found Sebastian. Ray: Oh! And the knife and chisel? Edgeworth: It seems he handed the evidence over to Blaise Debeste. It's very likely that Blaise knows the whereabouts of the murder weapon. Ray: Ex-chairman Debeste!? But, why would Blaise...? Edgeworth: That, I don't know yet. However, there may be some hidden connection between... ...Fifi Laguarde and Blaise. Ray: Gotcha. In that case, I'll issue a subpoena for Blaise Debeste right away. Edgeworth: ! Ray: I'll grill him personally. Edgeworth: I will continue to search for the missing evidence. (And for Shaun, as well...) Ray: Try to hurry it up, would ya? We're at our wits end over here! It feels like the verdict could be handed down at any moment! Edgeworth: Understood. (How much longer can Judge Gravelle's heart hold out? I know she's in a lot of pain... I've got to hurry.) Outside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza Kay: So? How's the trial going? Edgeworth: Blaise will be taking the stand. I don't know how things will turn out, though. Kay: He'll do anything, from hiding evidence to kidnapping... He really is nothing but trouble. Edgeworth: I agree. We should probably take another look at the evidence concerning him. Kay: OK! Leave it to me! First, here's the latest evidence fresh from the scene! Edgeworth: They're... the gloves from earlier. Although I am certainly curious about them... Anything else? Kay: The case files from the IS-7 Incident. If I recall, Blaise was also involved in this, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. He was involved in destroying the evidence. For now, let's keep this on hand. IS-7 Incident Documents jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Now then... is there anything else? Kay: Of course! Last but not least... We've got this! Edgeworth: This is... the Yatagarasu's badge. ...Kay. I'm talking about things related to Blaise. Please be serious. Kay: But aren't you always going around presenting random evidence too, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Gah...! No... W-Well... That's... Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?) Kay: Ah! What're you doing here? Debeste: WHOOOOOOOAAAHH! Kay: H-He ignored us... Edgeworth: (He came out of the Grand Tower... What was he doing in there?) Kay: Let's go investigate what Mr. Debeste was up to! Edgeworth: Yes... Let us go. Grand Tower - Rooftop Edgeworth: Hm? (The hatch is open...) Kay: It might be Mr. Debeste who opened it! Grand Tower - 51st Floor Storeroom Edgeworth: (Did Sebastian come in here...?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Over there! The safe's open! Edgeworth: (Did he come here to open that? ...Let's examine it thoroughly.) Kay: There's something inside the safe! Edgeworth: Let's go ahead and have a look. There are some documents in here... Kay: Hmm... it's just a bunch of papers and... huh? There's a photo here too. Edgeworth: Hm? This is a picture of...! Kay: Huh!? Th-That's Mr. Knightley! Knightley: ...Horace Knightley. The president's bodyguard. Kay: Why is his picture here? And what are all of these papers for!? Edgeworth: I don't know... We will have to read the documents to find out. I'm all but certain there is a connection between Knightley and Kanis. Kanis's chess partner, whose identity remained unknown until now... ...was actually Knightley all along. That is proof enough. Tomorrow, I shall interrogate him in the warden's office. I'll get him to confess that he's one of Kanis's henchmen. That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago... ...you simply must retrieve it. Edgeworth: This... seems to be a report about Knightley. Kay: Not to mention, it was apparently written before Knightley was killed...! Edgeworth: (Horace Knightley was murdered while he was being interrogated in the warden's office...) Judging from the contents, this document was probably written by Fifi Laguarde. Kay: I knew it! Edgeworth: The question, however, is who this report was addressed to. Kay: Ah! The owner of this safe is...! Edgeworth: The Conductor... Blaise Debeste. Kay: So, this proves that Ms. Laguarde and Blaise are connected! Edgeworth: Indeed. However, it's not just the two of them. Kay: Huh? Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste and Fifi Laguarde were searching for Kanis's henchmen. Kay: Bodhidharma Kanis! That dog-loving assassin! Edgeworth: This means that there is a hidden connection between the three of them. Kay: I wonder what it could be? Edgeworth: I don't know, but it must be related to this case. Report on Knightley jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Ah! There's some other stuff in here that I remember seeing! Edgeworth: Hm? There's something on his finger. Kay: Let's have a closer look! Oh! It looks like an expensive ring! Edgeworth: Don't steal it. Kay: Wha...! I didn't do anything yet! Edgeworth: It's Horace Knightley's... The chessboard and the ring... All of his possessions are inside this safe. Kay: So basically, all of this stuff is evidence from the prison case? Edgeworth: Correct. Kay: Then, the knife and chisel that vanished might be in here too! Let's see. Mr. Knife... Mr. Chisel... Hmm. They're not in there... I guess this is all just Mr. Knightley's stuff. Edgeworth: I see... That's too bad. (Horace Knightley... is dead.) Knightley: EEEEEDGEWOOOOOORTH!!! This game isn't over yet! You hear me! I...! I...! Edgeworth: (However, the game is not over yet... ...unless I can see it through to its end!) Knightley's Mementos data jotted down in my Organizer. Grand Tower - Rooftop ???: Young lady, good sir. ...Might I interest you in some cotton candy? Edgeworth: Hm? ???: There is also ice cream, if that is what you'd prefer? Edgeworth: Y-You! Sh-Shelly de Killer! de Killer: It's good to see you are well, Mr. Edgeworth. Kay: Wh-What are you doing in a place like this!? de Killer: As you can see, I am selling cotton candy. Would you care for some \"Heavenly Cotton Candy\"? Even sweeter than death. One bite will send you straight to heaven. Edgeworth: (That's definitely not something I'd want to buy from De Killer.) de Killer: The meaning of my message... Have you understood it? de Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Edgeworth: Have you been spying on us this whole time? de Killer: Spying? Heavens no. I was simply watching over you... ...while disguised as a cotton candy salesman. Edgeworth: (Isn't that the exact same thing!? What is this man's objective?) Were you the one... who murdered the president? de Killer: No. The contact with my client has already expired. ...President Huang is a bit of a celebrity in the world of assassins, you see. Over the years, many attempts on his life were made, and yet, he stubbornly lives on. He is a robust man, surrounded by flawless security. He even employs body doubles. Edgeworth: (Robust... That president? Rotund seems more apt.) ...However, it seems this time the president's security wasn't exactly flawless. Kay: Mr. Rooke had only just prevented your previous assassination, but this time...! de Killer: I did not kill him. It is not my principle to kill needlessly. I am also grateful to Rooke, a worthy adversary who was connected to me by fate. Thanks to that man, I did not kill a target who had no value to be killed. Edgeworth: (\"Thanks\" to Rooke preventing the assassination... What does he mean?) de Killer: My client deliberately gave me a false target. ...It was a betrayal most foul. I am now searching for my client. In all likelihood... ...it is the same person you are looking for. Edgeworth: (Is he saying that his client murdered the president?) Just who is this person you are referring to...? de Killer: I, myself, am not allowed to say. It would be a violation of the rules. I cannot disclose the identity of my clients. For to do so would create a problem of trust with my other clients. This is precisely why I am personally searching for them myself. Kay: What are you going to do when you find your client? de Killer: Of course... they shall be rewarded with a punishment most befitting of a traitor. Kay: Whaaaa!? That person... Wh-What'll happen to them? de Killer: ...I will leave that up to your imagination. Edgeworth: (It certainly won't be anything pleasant...) de Killer: Oh, yes... I will tell you just one more thing. Three days ago, Bodhidharma Kanis escaped from prison. Edgeworth: What!? de Killer: Three nights past, Kanis's solitary cell was found vacant. It was almost as if he knew I would come pay a visit. Edgeworth: (He visited Kanis's cell? Could it be, that the person De Killer is searching for is...) de Killer: Well then, if you'll excuse me, I must get going. Let us both do our best in tracking down that person... Edgeworth: (So, De Killer and Kanis. These two assassins...) Outside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza Edgeworth: (Hmm. This sound is...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Judge Gravelle's cellphone is ringing! Edgeworth: (Could it be Shaun?) ???: Mr. Edgeworth. How are you doing? Edgeworth: (It sounds like they're using a voice changer...) Who is this? ???: Someone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood... Edgeworth: (The red hood?) ...Are you the person who ambushed Kay? ???: Brilliant deduction! I'd expect no less from a prodigy prosecutor such as yourself! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I wanna listen in on this too! Edgeworth: Very well. (I'll put it on speaker...) ???: Well, I must say that I didn't expect the girl to get amnesia. Kay: Hey! What's that supposed to mean!? ???: But that's not all, y'see. Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane. Edgeworth: What!? (This must be the person De Killer spoke of...!) ???: I really should thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: You have no reason to thank me! ???: Oh, you haven't noticed? My, that's troublesome, y'know. I wanted you to catch Blaise for me... ...so I took dear little Kay. Edgeworth: What? ???: If Kay was suspected, I knew you would investigate the case. And I was sure that the great Miles Edgeworth would be able to catch Blaise! It was according to my plan! And y'know, I get the feeling that you have the wrong idea, so let me clear something up. Blaise Debeste wasn't the one who kidnapped Ms. Gravelle's son. Edgeworth: ! You... Why do you know about the kidnapping? ???: You and Ms. Gravelle are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you... Edgeworth: (How could this person know something like that...? Judge Gravelle was supposed to have visited me using the detective's name...) ???: I bet you're wondering how I knew about the kidnapping, right? It's quite simple, really! It's because darling little Shaun is in my care right now. Edgeworth: What!? Kay: Huh!? ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Quickly, little Kay! You have to hurry and steal him back! You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you? Kay: You even know it's my first job!? Edgeworth: (Why does this person know everything in so much detail?) ???: Well... I suppose I can't blame you for your mistake. It seems Blaise was after Shaun as well, y'see. Edgeworth: (So there were two kidnappings...) ???: He's such a fool, y'know. Kidnapping his own son instead! Edgeworth: Is Shaun there with you? If he is, then I would like to hear his voice. ???: Hmm. He's here, but I'm afraid I can't do that. Y'see, he's asleep right now. Edgeworth: In that case, there's no way for us to know if you really kidnapped Shaun or not. ???: ...Hmph. I suppose you don't have to believe me if you don't want to. Edgeworth: What is your objective? Is it to get Fifi Laguarde declared not guilty? ???: A not guilty verdict, eh... I couldn't care less about that. Edgeworth: (So his objective is different from Blaise's?) ???: ...I think I'll keep my objective a secret for now. Well then, I must be going. I hope you enjoy yourself, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Don't think you can get away with this. ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: Ngh...! Kay: Who in the world was that...? Edgeworth: I don't know. We don't have enough information. Kay: Darn it! We're totally clueless! Meanwhile, they seem to know everything about us! Edgeworth: ! (Know everything about us...?) Kay, you're right. Thinking about it, it is strange. How does the culprit know so much about us? Kay: It's so weird! I mean they even know about the kidnapping! Edgeworth: We must figure out how the culprit was able to obtain that information. (I must recall... What exactly did that person know?) ???: You and Ms. Gravelle are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you... ???: You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you? Kay: You even know it's my first job!? ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Edgeworth: (That's it! By analyzing our conversation with the culprit...!) I've figured it out, Kay. I know the source of this person's information! Kay: What!? Really!? Edgeworth: In all likelihood, this person probably... Edgeworth: I believe it is highly likely that we have been bugged. Kay: B-Bugged!? Edgeworth: If you recall what that person said... ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Edgeworth: If they couldn't see our faces, that means they weren't talking our pictures or following us. Kay: Th-Then, they must've planted a bug somewhere! Could it be in my stuff...? Edgeworth: (Was there anything they could have had a chance to bug...? There must be a hint somewhere in our conversation just now... That's right... that person knew something they shouldn't have. The conversation between Judge Gravelle and myself in the visitor's room...) Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! Gravelle: Hush. Please, have a seat. Edgeworth: (The only evidence I had with me at the time was...!) Where was the bug planted...? Edgeworth: Kay. May I see your badge? Kay: My Yatagarasu's badge? No way! Edgeworth: Wh-Why not...? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, just because you became a Great Thief's assistant... ...doesn't mean you're ready to wear this badge yet! Edgeworth: That's not it! It's very likely that a bug was planted in it. Kay: Whaaat!? In my badge? Edgeworth: Let's take a closer look. Kay: Ah! This is...! Edgeworth: It seems I was right. Yatagarasu's Badge data updated in my Organizer. Kay: How did you know? Edgeworth: The person had been in contact with you. Kay: You mean, when I was knocked unconscious. Edgeworth: Yes. That's why I thought one of your possessions might have been bugged. However, that person also overheard my conversation with Judge Gravelle. Even though that conversation took place in the visitor's room with just the two of us... Kay: Ah, so you were holding onto it at that time... Edgeworth: Exactly. All the other evidence had been taken away from me... Only the Yatagarasu's badge remained with me. Kay: So this creep's been listening in on us the whole time! Edgeworth: Indeed. That must be how they knew about all the information we collected. Kay: Does that mean... they're also listening in on this conversation? Edgeworth: Most likely. Kay: Hey, buster! Edgeworth: K-Kay... Kay: Eavesdropping is for cowards! Why don't you come out here and fight us fair and square!? Edgeworth: (Hm? What was that sound just now?) Nicole: Owwwwwwww... Kay: Huh? That's... Nicole! Nicole: Honestly, y'all scared the bejeezus out of me! Your voice was so loud there, Lil' Missy... I was so surprised I done fell flat on my behind! Kay: I-I'm sorry...! Nicole: What were ya gettin' so riled up for? Kay: You gotta hear this! It really grinds my gears! Nicole: Yes, yes? Edgeworth: ...Kay. Please just leave it at that. Unless you want to make tomorrow morning's headlines. Kay: Ah! That was close... Nicole: Aww, shucks. Don't be such a stick in the mud... What's wrong with lettin' a gal open her heart and spill the beans? Edgeworth: (For now, I'll turn the bug off.) Bug data jotted down in my Organizer. Nicole: So... did ya find the kidnappers? Edgeworth: Ms. Swift. Was the boy you saw being kidnapped... ...this boy in the photo? Nicole: Hmm? Nope, they ain't nothin' alike. He had a more stupid-lookin' face, and was wearin' a collared school uniform... Kay: I thought so... Edgeworth: (Yet again, we were led astray by this woman's testimony...) We will have to conduct our investigation all over again. So, we're back where we started. Are there any new leads...? (There's only 20 minutes left until 2 o'clock! Will we be able to make it in time...?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Mr. Edgeworth! About that phone call just now... Wasn't there a strange sound at the end? Edgeworth: A strange sound...? Edgeworth: Don't think you can get away with this. ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: Now that you mention it... It sounded like an explosion (Sound of an explosion - Sound of an explosion was heard during the call from the kidnapper.). It might be a hint to establish the culprit's whereabouts... Nicole: Mm-hmm. I see, I see. The sound of an explosion, eh? Edgeworth: Hmph! I would appreciate it if you stopped eavesdropping on us! Nicole: Mr. Prosecutor... Yer as stingy as ever. Edgeworth: (...First, let's see what she has to say...) (Clearing all \"Talk\" options of Nicole leads to:) Nicole's Tape Recorder data jotted down in my Organizer. ???: Mr. Edgewooooorth! Edgeworth: Mr. Saint, Ms. Berry! Simeon: D-Did you find him? Kay: Not yet. Just where could Shaun be...? Simeon: Shaun? Kay: Ah! No, no! It's nothing! Don't worry about it. Edgeworth: (They don't know anything about the kidnapping.) Regarding Sebastian, we found him not too long ago. Simeon: Really!? That's great! Thank you so much! Now I won't be arrested again. Edgeworth: Based on the explosion sound we heard from the kidnapper's phone... ...we know that Shaun is being confined some place in the vicinity of the Coliseum. Kay: One of the garbage dumps is right next to the Coliseum! Edgeworth: Shaun was almost certainly taken there. In which case... the place he is being confined to must also be somewhere close by. Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Could I ask you to search the area around this garbage dump? Gumshoe: .....You don't have to ask me like we're strangers, sir! It feels... so distant. ...Please just order me around like you normally do. Edgeworth: Are you sure, Detective? Right now I'm not a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Didn't I tell you, sir? Detectives don't just investigate for the sake of prosecutors! Edgeworth: ...You have my thanks, Detective. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth. Look. It's almost time...! Edgeworth: Yes. It would be best if we hurry. They should also be at their limit. Detective Gumshoe, I'm counting on you! Gumshoe: Leave it to me, sir! This may be an unofficial investigation... ...but I'll call in all of my pals from the station to help! Kay: I'll help too! Stealing Shaun back is my job, after all! Edgeworth: I'll be returning to the courtroom. I might be able to draw out some more time. Kay: Oookay! Well then! Even in the depths of... night... Edgeworth: Hmm. The clock just struck 2...! We have to hurry! Gumshoe: Yessir! Kay: Aaah, my introduction! ...When no other bird dares to take fliiight... Blaise: Well, well, well. If it isn't former Prosecutor Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Blaise Debeste...!) Franziska: Witness! Face forward! We're not done talking yet! Blaise: Like I said, y'see. Why exactly would I have needed to help that person out, Your Honor? Blaise: Y'know, it's a crying shame. Having a beautiful woman declared guilty. Honestly, it brings tears to my eyes. But y'see, there's no reason for me to go out of my way to hide evidence just to save her. Franziska: Franziska: However, we still have the testimony of your son, Prosecutor Debeste! He testified that he handed the evidence over to you! Blaise: Hmm. Well, I haven't the slightest clue what he was talking about. I simply can't imagine why Sebastian would have said something like that, y'know. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What if there is evidence that shows your connection with Warden Laguarde? Blaise: Hm? And just what do you think you're doing, \"Former\" Prosecutor Edgeworth? I was under the impression that you were no longer in any position to stand in court? Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! How dare you barge into my prosecutor's bench... Edgeworth: Franziska. I'm sorry. I need you to lend me the bench for a little while. Franziska: Wh-What are you saying...!? Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! I've brought vital evidence related to this case. Your Honor, please allow me to testify! Gravelle: ........ Blaise: Hah hah hah! She'd never allow it! Ray: Ray: Gravelle-pie. Uncle Ray also asks that he be allowed to testify. There are no objections from the prosecution either, right? Franziska: .......... Understood. The prosecution also has no objections. Blaise: Blaise: There's no way you can allow something like this, y'know. Such high-handed methods... ...surely are enough to warrant being held in contempt of court. Wouldn't y'say, Gravelle? Gravelle: ........ Edgeworth: (Ngh! As long as Shaun is still in danger... ...Judge Gravelle cannot rule against the warden. I must convey to her somehow that the search for her son is progressing!) Judge Gravelle. I ask that you have faith in me and my assistant. Franziska: Now that you mention it, where exactly is she...? Edgeworth: She is currently out searching for the most important piece of evidence. Blaise: Blaise: It's a waste of time. There's no such evidence. Are you stalling for time? How disgraceful. Ray: Ray: Most important piece of evidence, huh? ...Gravelle-pie. I don't really know what that evidence is, but I think we should have faith in her. After all, even if she may not look like it, she's still the Great Thief Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: (Somehow... it seems that Mr. Shields understands.) Judge Gravelle! We've already determined the general location of that evidence. It's only a matter of time before she steals the evidence back. Gravelle: ! ......I understand. Then I shall give you special permission to testify. Edgeworth: ...Thank you, Your Honor. Blaise: This is ridiculous! Gravelle: This vital evidence that you have found... Please present it to the court! Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste and Fifi Laguarde are somehow connected. Allow me to present the evidence that proves it! (Which piece of evidence shows the relationship between Fifi Laguarde and Blaise Debeste?) Edgeworth: This document contains a detailed report regarding the interrogation of a certain man. Ray: A certain man? Edgeworth: That man being the late Horace Knightley. And, the one who interrogated him was the defendant in this trial, Fifi Laguarde. Ray: ! So that means, that was the interrogation where... Edgeworth: That's right... Fifi Laguarde murdered Knightley in the aftermath of the interrogation. And that very interrogation has been recorded in this written report! Gravelle: That... definitely sounds like vital evidence! Franziska: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. Just now, you referred to that document as a \"written report\". Now, just who in the world was that report written for? Edgeworth: I thought you might ask that, Franziska. And that's precisely what is most important about this report...! We found this document inside the safe in the storeroom on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower. Franziska: The 51st floor... The storeroom for the black market auction! Edgeworth: Indeed. And the Conductor of the auction was you, Blaise Debeste! Blaise: ............ Edgeworth: You received a report about the victim from Warden Laguarde! In the face of this evidence, can you still say you have no connection to this case? Blaise: ......In regards to that, I refuse to answer. Edgeworth: What? Blaise: It has yet to be proven in court that I was the Conductor of the black market auction. Edgeworth: Oh? Have you already forgotten the events of this morning? I believe I had already proved it back then, did I not? Blaise: I will not deny that I was bested by you. However, that was at the crime scene. Who knows if the results will be the same in court. An acquittal is still possible, y'see. ...Until it's been proven in court that I am the Conductor of the black market auctions... ...you can't prove that document was addressed to me. Edgeworth: Your logic is twisted...! Blaise: That's not very nice, y'know. My logic isn't twisted, is it? Gravelle? Don't you feel the same way? It was quite unlike you to allow Former Prosecutor Edgeworth's statement just now, y'know. ...It saddens me, y'see. That you would fail to uphold the law as a judge should. In fact, I'm so upset by this, I may have no other choice but to use my last resort, y'know. Gravelle: .....I-It is as you say. Something that has not been proven in court does not merit any deliberation. I will have to... overrule... Mr. Edgeworth's claim. Edgeworth: (Ngh... As I thought, until Shaun has been rescued...) Blaise: Y'see? The truth at the scene and the truth in the courtroom are two very different things. Edgeworth: So, you're saying the truth can be distorted in court, as long as it's for your sake? Blaise: What a horrible thing to say. I'm not distorting the truth or anything like that, y'know. If a not guilty verdict is handed down, then that becomes the truth. That's all it is, y'see. Edgeworth: (It's useless. There's nothing we can do useless the missing evidence turns up...) Blaise: Now then, Gravelle. Why don't you deliver a Not Guilty verdict and let's get this over with? After all, that evidence... isn't gonna show up any time soon, y'know. ???: Gravelle: Wh-Who raised an objection just now? Debeste: ...P-Pops... Blaise: .....Sebastian. Debeste: ......Uugh. Blaise: Why did you come back here, now of all times? Gravelle: Sebastian! What is the meaning of this? Franziska: Just where were you and what have been doing since you abandoned your own trial? Debeste: I-I'm sorry. I was... umm... Franziska: Such an act is unbecoming of a prosecutor! You should be ashamed! Debeste: I... umm... well... Blaise: Sebastian. You still don't get it, y'know. This court has no place for sniveling child such as yourself! Debeste: .....Pops.....! I...... I...! I-I've come to present new evidence, Your Honor! So, so... please! Let me take my place back at the prosecutor's bench! Edgeworth: (Sebastian...! I didn't think he would come back...) Blaise: Blaise: Hah hah hah hah! What's all this now, Sebastian? You don't seem at all like your normal self! Debeste: ........Uugh. Pops... Blaise: Hm? Come now! What's the matter? You want Daddy to play with you? Is that it? Well then, why don't we just head on back home. Debeste: R-Return to the witness stand. Blaise: What's wrong? You're shaking like a leaf. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! The prosecutor officially in charge of this case has just arrived with new evidence. The trial is still in session. In light of this, shouldn't we continue with the proceedings? Gravelle: ........ Ray: Naturally, the defense has no objections, Your Honor. I'm sure the defense attorney originally in charge would say the same. Franziska: .....The prosecution has no objections, either, Your Honor. Gravelle: .......... Blaise: Continue with the proceedings? That won't be necessary. Isn't that right? Gravelle. Edgeworth: (Blaise still believes that he was the one who kidnapped Shaun. As long as Shaun still hasn't been found... ...Judge Gravelle will remain bound by Blaise, and nothing else will change that!) Gravelle: .......... Th-That sound is... Edgeworth: (Her cell phone...!) Hm...! (My phone as well...?) Ray: Eh? Uncle Ray's phone is also...! Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! Kay: Mr. Shields! Gumshoe: We've found Shaun, sir! Kay: We rescued Shaun! Edgeworth: Excellent work, Detective! Ray: That kid was the most important piece of evidence, right? Way to go, Kay! Kay: Eheheh! I wanted to spread the word quickly, so I had everyone call! Edgeworth: .....Judge Gravelle. It's for you. Gravelle: ..... Gravelle: .......Yes. I see. I'm..... I'm so glad you're safe...! Make sure you properly thank everyone. OK? ............Be careful, and come home safe. Gravelle: ...Let us resume the proceedings. Now that I may once again swing my gabel to my heart's content. Blaise: Hah...! You're kidding, right? This is just a sad joke, y'know! Gravelle: Witness! This is no joke! Please return to the stand! Prosecutor Debeste, as well. Promptly return to your seat at the prosecutor's bench! Debeste: Y-Yes, Your Honor! Franziska: ........Sebastian Debeste. Debeste: Y-Yes, Ms. von Karma...!? Franziska: .....I leave the rest to you. Debeste: Huh...? Franziska: \"Going up against your own father...\" It won't be easy. I shall observe how things pan out... from the gallery. Gravelle: Now then, allow me to ask once more... Is the prosecution ready? Prosecutor Debeste. What is this new evidence you wish to present...? Debeste: .....The missing knife and chisel, Your Honor. Ray: You mean they've finally been found!? Gravelle: Prosecutor Debeste! Is this true!? Debeste: ...Th-The knife and chisel... I wasn't able to find them... I searched and searched! I really did! But... it was already too late... Edgeworth: (Too late...?) Ray: What do you mean? Debeste: I remembered... This morning, when I passed by Pops in the garage at home... ...he was holding something wrapped in a newspaper. Debeste: Pops, where are you going? Blaise: Ah, Sebastian. Just taking out some trash. Debeste: At that moment, I heard it. .....The faint sound of a bell. Ray: Could that sound have been, by any chance... Edgeworth: ...the bell attached to Kanis's chisel!? Gravelle: In other words... you're saying that the witness threw away the evidence? Blaise: ........ Debeste: I searched for it, but I didn't make it in time. I'm sorry... Ray: Where exactly did you search for it? Debeste: The garbage dump! I went to the garbage dump and searched everywhere! I thought the evidence Pops threw away had to be there...! Edgeworth: Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?) Kay: Ah! What're you doing here? Debeste: WHOOOOOOOAAAHH! Kay: H-He ignored us... Edgeworth: (So at that time, he had gone to the garbage dump...) Debeste: But... but... ...this was all I could find. Gravelle: This is...? It smells rather peculiar... Ray: Now that you mention it, there's kind of a funky smell coming from you as well... Debeste: Wh-What do you expect!? I was digging through garbage! Edgeworth: And what of the knife? Debeste: I think it's buried somewhere in that giant mountain of trash... ...but I couldn't find it by myself. Gravelle: ...I understand. I shall accept this into evidence. Blaise: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Well done, Sebastian! You never betray my expectations, y'know! You searched so desperately through the garbage and that's all you have to show for it? Debeste: Urk...! Blaise: Awww, what a tear-jerker! I'm tearing up already! Ray: Ray: It's a bit too early for tears, don't you think? We haven't examined the evidence properly yet. Blaise: ...I think it's just a pointless waste of time, y'know. Ray: I'm counting on you. Sebastian, Miles. Show him that the truth can be exposed in court and take him down! Edgeworth: (Mr. Shields is backing us up. Now all we need is a breakthrough...!) Prosecutor Debeste. Let's take a closer look at the evidence. Debeste: R... Right! Edgeworth: Let's have a look inside. (It'd be great if we could find some kind of proof.) This is... the bell that was attached to Kanis's chisel... Are there any traces left behind on it? Debeste: .....Ack, it's no good. There's not even a single smudge on it... Gravelle: What did you find, Prosecutor Debeste!? Blaise: Did you even find anything? Debeste: D... Darn it... Blaise: Of course you'd find nothing. Something like that can't be called evidence, y'know. All it is, is trash. It may be sad, but that's the truth, y'see. Edgeworth: (Were Sebastian's efforts all for naught...?) Indeed, this bell does not seem to be valid evidence... (However...) Debeste: Mr. Edgeworth! Are you really giving up!? Blaise: Calm as always, Edgeworth. Quite unlike Sebastian here! Gravelle: ...Well then, is the prosecution finished with its argument? Debeste: Debeste: Verity, not yet! We're not through yet! There's still something we haven't examined! Blaise: You're still not giving up? Struggling in vain's not cute at all, y'know. Edgeworth: (It seems Sebastian hasn't given up yet either. I was just thinking the exact same thing. The last item remaining... Is it trash, or is it evidence...? If we don't examine it, we'll never find out... The item I'm thinking of is...) Debeste: We're still not done examining the newspaper that the bell was wrapped in! Edgeworth: (It seems that Sebastian has the same idea as I do.) Blaise: Wow, this is just wonderful, y'know. So wonderful, it's to cry for. Is it desperation, or simply reckless abandon? Are you really going to... pin all your hopes on a worthless scrap of newspaper? Edgeworth: Heh. We won't know for sure whether or not it's \"worthless\" until we examine it, will we? Sebastian. Let's examine it posthaste. Edgeworth: Is this... a handprint? Debeste: ! There's something greasy on here too... Is it oil? Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! We'd like to request a fingerprint analysis on this paper! Could you please summon someone from forensics? Gravelle: Your request is accepted. Contact the lab at once! Forensics: Reporting! These are definitely fingerprints! However... it's from a glove! Debeste: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? Blaise: Didn't I tell you? It's nothing but a worthless scrap of paper. Just thinking about it, y'know. When handling important evidence... ...what kind of idiot wouldn't use gloves!? Oh wait, wouldn't that be you? The idiot who doesn't know when to give up. Ray: ...That's pretty harsh, talking to your son like that. Blaise: What's wrong with calling an idiot an idiot? If you want to be The Best, you have to be heartless. I have no compassion worthless individuals, not even my own son! Debeste: Pops...! I.....! Blaise: Y'know, you've always called yourself a genius prosecutor, haven't you? Didn't I explain to you this morning why you were a genius up until now? That's right. It was all because of me. Because of my authority. You were always being protected. By people like Gravelle... and me. Debeste: ........Uuunghh. Blaise: Now, get that stinking face of yours out of my sight. Debeste: Stinking... Blaise: Y'know, now that I think about it, that stench might just suit you perfectly. Just keep it away from my nose, or my eyes will start watering. Debeste: Debeste: Wrong... You're wrong, Pops. Blaise: ...Sebastian? What are you talking about? Debeste: ...You're the one who stinks, Pops. It's you, not me! Blaise: What...? Debeste: ...You haven't noticed, have you? You smell, Pops. So much that you can't even hide it. Mr. Edgeworth... Try smelling the hand print on the newspaper. Edgeworth: The smell...? ...Hmm. It smells... like oil... Debeste: I know something that smells just like it... Edgeworth: (Come to think of it, back then...) Edgeworth: (It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.) Debeste: That's right... The smell proves it. It proves that the culprit who hid the evidence was...! It's no good... I guess I can't become the best after all. I'm too soft... I could never be so heartless... ...I just can't bring down my father with my own hands. Edgeworth: (Prosecutor Debeste...) ..........Summon... your courage. \"Become a different prosecutor from your father\"... Wasn't that what you decided? Debeste: ! Edgeworth: We are prosecutors. And as prosecutors, we stand in the courtroom. In that case, isn't it our duty to shed light on the truth? Debeste: ........ Edgeworth: Exposing crimes and bringing criminals to justice. Even if the criminal is your own father... ...that is your duty, as a prosecutor. Didn't I promise you? That if you have the courage to stand up... I will show you the way. And if you cannot do it alone, then we shall do it together... Debeste: ...Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Allow me to present the evidence that connects this hand print with my father! Edgeworth: This is the smell of motor oil. The kind used for maintaining motorcycles... Debeste: Both myself and Mr. Edgeworth have smelled this exact same smell before! Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste! It was in your garage! Blaise: ! Edgeworth: And wouldn't you say these fingerprints have a rather peculiar shape? The five letters that spell out D-E-A-T-H. It's exactly the same as your own gloves. Blaise: Blaise: Ha ha ha! You can buy gloves like that from anywhere! It doesn't prove a thing! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that really the case? Debeste: That's not the only thing that these two pieces of evidence have in common! Edgeworth: (The fingerprints on the newspaper that was used to wrap up the bell... ...and Blaise's mechanic's gloves...) This is the unmistakable similarity they both share! Edgeworth: If you examine the imprint left by the letter A, you'll see it's unmistakably from this glove. Blaise: Whaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: And that's not all... There is one more item we must take note of. Namely, these dirt stains. I suggest we do a comparative analysis of the dirt stains from the newspaper and the glove. If the contents match up... then it will prove to be decisive evidence. Gravelle: Bailiff! Please have these dirt samples sent to forensics for analysis immediately! Blaise: Gaaaaaaaarrgh! Edgewooorth! Sebastiaaaan! You lowly prosecutors! Do you have any idea who I am!? Debeste: Pops... you can't run away anymore. It's been proven in court that you concealed the evidence. And that you tried to cover for the defendant... Blaise: Y-You're saying that I'm... Guilty? That I'll be sent to prison...? Me, Blaise Debeste? A couple of snot-nosed punks are gonna make me disappear!? There must be some mistake! Debeste: Debeste: Be a man and admit your crimes! Blaise: Blaise: Do you really think you can survive if I'm not around? Debeste: I..... I'll be fine now. I thought I wanted to be the best prosecutor, so I could get your approval, Pops. But, when I was kidnapped by your men... and stuck in that dark room, I started thinking. \"I am... truly powerless.\" I despaired, and averted my eyes from the truth. But... ...at that moment, Mr. Edgeworth stepped in and showed me the way. And now, I am no longer just a child chasing after his father's approval! I've become capable... I can find evidence on my own now! Blaise: Wha... My men kidnapped you? Why were you...!? Debeste: Debeste: Pops, I'll show you the truth you never knew... through this trial. Blaise: Sebastiaaan! How dare you speak to me like that...! You should've just stayed as an idiot son! Debeste: You may have hated me to the very end, Pops... ...but I... I've always looked up to you. Thank you for everything up until now. .....And goodbye. Blaise: You... Since when did you... All you've ever been able to do was depend on me! SebaSTIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNN! Gravelle: It has been established that the evidence was concealed by Blaise Debeste himself. A judgment regarding his concealment of evidence shall be delivered at a separate trial. The missing chisel and knife still have yet to be found. However, once a search of the waste disposal site is underway, they will surely be discovered. Laguarde: ...The knife will be found? Wh-What will happen to me if it's found? Edgeworth: Heh. No need to worry. You'll simply receive the punishment you deserve for your crime. Laguarde: Grrrr! Punishment? For me!? Blaise, what in the world are you doing!? You! You... After all your boasting about being able to create your own truths and Not Guilty verdicts! That's why I contacted you immediately after the prison incident in the first place! And to make matters worse, you even kidnapped the wrong kid! I just can't believe this! You really, really, really are... completely useleeeeeessss! Edgeworth: ...That was certainly a violent outburst. But you heard her, Prosecutor Debeste. Debeste: Yeah. She got flustered and said a bunch of important stuff! ...Right? Edgeworth: Indeed... That's correct. (He still doesn't seem very sure of himself...) Gravelle: Very well. And with that, this court is adjourned. ???: Edgeworth: What? Franziska: Huh!? Gravelle: Wh-Who are you? Lang: Judge Gravelle. It's still too early for a happy ending. Lang Zi says: \"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case.\" Gravelle: And who... might you be? Lang: The name's Shi-Long Lang. I'm just a humble, lone investigator. Gravelle: Do you have some objection with this trial? Lang: Hah! Not a chance! The defendant there has a heart as black as a moonless night. Laguarde: Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...? Lang: You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree? Edgeworth: Agent Lang. What are you talking about? Lang: The SS-5 Incident from 12 years ago... It's a case I'll never forget. Edgeworth: (12 years ago...?) Lang: ......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa. Edgeworth: (12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?) Edgeworth: (Might it have something to do with Lang's father and President Huang?) Lang: Fifi Laguarde. And you, Blaise Debeste. Back then, the two of you killed off the Lang clan... Laguarde: Rrgh... Gravelle: Were you involved in the incident 12 years ago? Lang: That's right, I was. However... I'm not here to chase after ghosts of the past. I'm here for you, Verity Gravelle...! Gravelle: M... Me? Lang: You, and one other... Shaun: .......... Gravelle: Shaun! Lang: Ms. Gravelle! You're coming along too! As a suspect in the murder of the president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang! What evidence do you...!? Lang: Lang: Settle down, Mr. Prosecutor. The investigation has only just begun. We're going to inspect the crime scene with the suspects in attendance. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang... did he get his hands on some new pieces of evidence?) Lang: If you have any objections, then you can tag along as well. Edgeworth: ...I shall do just that. Shaun: ........ Edgeworth: (\"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case\"... There are still many mysteries yet unsolved surrounding the murder of the president... Namely, the true nature of the \"giant monster\", and...) ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: (The true identity of the person on the other end of the phone...) To be continued. \n-- Shaun's Rehearsal -- Shaun: I wasn't feeling too great during yesterday's shoot, so I made a few bloopers. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. You said you didn't feel well. Could you tell me more concretely what was wrong? Shaun: That doesn't matter! I just wasn't feeling well, alright!? Kay: You weren't feeling well... Maybe you drank too much milk? Shaun: Wha... How'd you...!? Ah, no, I mean, that's not it... Edgeworth: (So he didn't feel well because of his stomach...) Kay: When I was young, I was told that chewing milk makes it easier on your stomach, y'know? Shaun: Th-This conversation is over! Anyways, I made a few bloopers. Shaun: They're reshooting the scene today, so... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So they planned to reshoot the scene today. And you were practicing for that last night. Shaun: ...My mistakes caused a lot of trouble for the people around me. I'm a pro, so practicing that much more is natural. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He certainly does have an admirable sense of responsibility.) Penny: Shaun is incredibly dedicated to his craft. He didn't even make any major mistakes in those bloopers. But he said if it would make the movie just a tiny bit better... Shaun: Shut up! You don't need to go around blabbering about stupid stuff like that! Penny: Ah... I-I'm sorry. Edgeworth: (If only he was a little more cooperative, I'd have no complaints.) Shaun: Hmph... Anyway, that's what happened. Shaun: Well, I decided to rehearse a little on my own. That's all. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. About your testimony just now... Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Don't I always tell you!? If you're going to practice by yourself, you have to let me know beforehand! Shaun: I-I-I know! Edgeworth: (...My time to speak was completely stolen away from me.) I shall ask you once more. Shaun, about your testimony just now... Kay: But you know, Shaun, I think that's really great! Edgeworth: (Mmph... A-Again!?) Kay: I bet putting in an honest effort like that will make someone even more talented. You'll go from a little thief to a Middle Thief, and then someday you'll become a Great Thief! I'll be doing my best, so you do your best too! OK, Shaun? Edgeworth: ........Ahem. Now then, if I may? Shaun. Do you often rehearse in that way? (At last... At long last, I finally got to ask my question...!) Shaun: I do it all the time. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There are no mistakes in that testimony, correct? Shaun: O-Of course there's no mistakes! It was just a normal, peaceful night! Nothing out of the ordinary happened at all! Kay: A... A peaceful night!? How can you say that when an incident like this has occurred!? Edgeworth: Kay, he is still a child. Please don't get seriously angry. Present Moozilla's Head Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that? Shaun: ...! I don't know anything about it. Edgeworth: Is that true? Shaun: I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something? Edgeworth: (...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after Shaun had already gone back...) Shaun: If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We're not done talking yet! Shaun: What now? Edgeworth: The falling monster's head wasn't the only unusual thing that happened last night. And this is something you should be well aware of. What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling? Present Monster's Footprints or Shaun's Practice Video Edgeworth: Leads to: \"We have evidence right here.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. Take a look at this. Shaun: And what's that supposed to be? Edgeworth: Don't you understand? This shows what happened last night. Shaun: ...... Edgeworth: Hmph... Have I left you speechless? Shaun: ...You're so far off the mark that I have nothing to say. Edgeworth: Argh! (Was I really that far off...?) Kay: Let's review what happened here last night one more time! Edgeworth: Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer! Kay: Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night? Leads back to: \"What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling?\" Edgeworth: We have evidence right here. Shaun: Ah! Could that be...!? Edgeworth: That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance. Shaun: ........Ugh. Lang: What!? You're telling me you have video from last night!? Edgeworth: Exactly. And in this video... ...there is clearly something that is out of the ordinary. Lang: Th-This is... a monster's footprint...! Edgeworth: Would you say that monster's footprints are commonplace on a film set? Gravelle: Shaun... Why did you conceal this video from us? Shaun: ........No reason, really. Lang: Lang: Hey, pup! This is no joking matter! You had a reason to hide it, right? Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Answer him clearly! Shaun: But Mom..... Edgeworth: Well? Shaun: ...I didn't want anyone to see me rehearsing. Lang: ........ Kay: ........ Edgeworth: ........ In other words, you're embarrassed about others seeing you practice. Shaun: ...Yeah. Got a problem with that!? Lang: Lang: You're saying that's why you hid the evidence? Gravelle: Shaun! Shaun: Eep! ...Quit nagging me. You've already busted me, what more do you want? Yeah, the footprints were there, but I just practiced and headed home. Lotta: How come yer so calm after findin' those footprints!? It's a monster, ya know!? A real live monster! Shaun: ...I thought it was just a part of the set. Besides, there's lots of other weird stuff around here too. Nicole: He's suspicious, Chief! This kid's really suspicious! Lotta: Yer right! The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven! Shaun: ...Shut up. We're done talking! Lang: Leads to: \"Wait up...\" Present Monster's Footprints or Shaun's Practice Video Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? We have evidence right here. Shaun: Ah! Could that be...!? Edgeworth: That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance. Shaun: ........Ugh. Lang: What!? You're telling me you have video from last night!? Edgeworth: Exactly. And in this video... ...there is clearly something that is out of the ordinary. Lang: Th-This is... a monster's footprint...!

This is no joking matter! You had a reason to hide it, right? Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Answer him clearly! Shaun: But Mom..... Edgeworth: Well? Shaun: ...I didn't want anyone to see me rehearsing. Lang: ........ Kay: ........ Edgeworth: ........ In other words, you're embarrassed about others seeing you practice. Shaun: ...Yeah. Got a problem with that!? Lang: Lang: You're saying that's why you hid the evidence? Gravelle: Shaun! Shaun: Eep! ...Quit nagging me. You've already busted me, what more do you want? Yeah, the footprints were there, but I just practiced and headed home. Lotta: How come yer so calm after findin' those footprints!? It's a monster, ya know!? A real live monster! Shaun: ...I thought it was just a part of the set. Besides, there's lots of other weird stuff around here too. Nicole: He's suspicious, Chief! This kid's really suspicious! Lotta: Yer right! The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven! Shaun: ...Shut up. We're done talking! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We're not done here yet! Shaun: What now? Edgeworth: The monster's footprints weren't the only unusual things that happened last night. Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night? Present Moozilla's Head Edgeworth: Leads to: \"A monster's head fell from the roof of that building.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This shows what happened here yesterday. Shaun: ...And just what exactly does it show? Edgeworth: You don't understand, do you? You are still a child, after all. Shaun: I don't need some guy who's less intelligent than a child telling me that. Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (It seems that wasn't it...) Kay: Let's review what happened here last night one more time! Edgeworth: Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer! Kay: Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night? Leads back to: \"Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night?\" Edgeworth: A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that? Shaun: ...! I don't know anything about it. Edgeworth: Is that true? Shaun: I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something? Edgeworth: (...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after Shaun had already gone back...) Shaun: If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking! Edgeworth: (It seems that Shaun doesn't really want to talk about last night. Could he be hiding something after all...?) Leads to: \"Wait up...\" Edgeworth: So there was nothing out of the ordinary...? Kay: He doesn't know anything at all about the incident. That's the impression I'm getting. But isn't there evidence that shows something did happen last night? Edgeworth: Yes... I don't have time to waste dealing with a child's lies. Let's present the contradiction. Lang: Wait up... Edgeworth: ? Agent Lang? Lang: Heh heh heh. It's as I thought. Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. This video backs up my logic. Kay: Huh!? Is there something in the video that's related to the case? Lang: Yeah... Take a good, hard look at the monster costume in the top-left. Kay: The Moozilla costume...? Lang: Try comparing it with the one over there right now. Kay: Hmm? It looks like it's just hanging there limply though. And the zipper on its back is zipped up tightly. Edgeworth: (Zipper on its back...?) Wha! (Th-This discrepancy is...!) Lang: Yeah. The difference is plain to see. In the video, the zipper is clearly open! That's right... Someone was inside. Kay: WHAAAAAAAT! Edgeworth: Mr. Powers! Is the costume's zipper usually...? Powers: It's always zipped up tightly when it's not in use... Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. Do you remember? My logic from before... Lang: Two nights ago, Gravelle pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body. Edgeworth: In here? Lang: Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Edgeworth: You're saying the body... was hidden inside the costume? Lang: Yeah, that's right! Judge Gravelle! Two nights ago, you pushed the president off the roof of the tower. You then hid the body inside the monster costume! Gravelle: I... I did no such thing! Lang: Lang: Say what you want, but you're the only one who could've done it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That should have already been proven impossible. The film lot was locked at the time! Judge Gravelle could not have entered this place! Lang: Lang: ...And what if there was an accomplice? Edgeworth: What? Lang: I'll tell you my reasoning, so listen up. -- Mother and Son Theory -- Lang: When the president was pushed off the roof, Shaun was waiting at the film lot. If Shaun was an accomplice, the problem with the locks would be resolved. The two of them then hid the president's body. Inside that monster costume over there... Edgeworth: You think this crime had such an elaborate plan? Lang: To take the life of a nation's president. An elaborate plan is to be expected, don't you think? Gravelle: Gravelle: Shaun would never... take part in such a crime! Lang: Lang: You're the one being suspected. Your words don't carry much weight! Edgeworth: I wouldn't think those two had sufficient motive for something like this, though? Lang: Well, maybe they had a motive that we didn't know about? You were the last one to meet with the president. And you're still keeping the details secret. Don't you think it's only natural that you're being suspected? Gravelle: ...... Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Is there no way for you to tell us your secret. Gravelle: M-My apologies. I just cannot, no matter what... However, when the time I can talk about it comes, I will surely let you know. So, if you could please... Lang: Believe you? Is that what you wanted to say? That's what all criminals say. And you, pup... If you've got an explanation, hurry up and spit it out. Shaun: Hmph. I didn't do nothing. ...That's all I'm saying. Lang: Both mother and son won't talk. You still gonna defend 'em like this? Edgeworth: It's true, Judge Gravelle's actions are a mystery... ...however, we still don't know whether or not that ties in with a motive for murder. Lang: Yeah, that's right. Their motive for murder can wait. For now, let's talk about the situation surrounding the crime. ...And the fact that these two are the only ones who could've done it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang. Don't tell me you're saying Shaun was an accomplice? Kay: Shaun still looks like a grade school kid, he's even got a kiddy backpack to boot! How could he be an accomplice...? There's just no way! Penny: Like I said, Shaun's already in middle school, and the backpack is a part of his costume... Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says! \"No matter how young the cub, never pity an ungrateful pup.\" He may be a little brat, but a villain deserves no mercy. Kay: Uuuh... So Mr. Lang Zi didn't make any allowances for age... Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. You're not just defending him 'cause he's a pup, are you? Edgeworth: Hmph. Of course, that was never my intention. I shall present suitable evidence in due course. Lang: Oh? I'm looking forward to it. My logic's just getting started. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How would that... resolve the problem!? Lang: I figured you'd ask that, Mr. Prosecutor. But y'know, it's actually quite simple. Listen up... First, that woman pushes the president off the roof. Kay: Hmm... she pushes him off. Lang: Then, that brat, who knew the combination for the lock, unlocks the film lot. Kay: I see... the combination unlocks the brat! Edgeworth: Kay, it's the opposite. Lang: ...That's all it takes. With this, the problem of the lock is solved. Your theory that she couldn't get in because she didn't know the combination no longer files! Edgeworth: (Hmm... Regarding the lock, that certainly is a plausible explanation...) Agent Lang. Thank you for your clear explanation. Please, continue with what you were saying before. Lang: Hmph. If you're gonna give up, you better do it now. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Supposing those two were accomplices... Why would they have needed to leave the body hanging there for an entire day!? Lang: Lang: Why don't you give it a rest, and take a good hard look at reality. Thanks to their trickery, our investigation has been confused up until now. Doesn't that about answer your question!? ...Got it? Those two hid the body. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In the video, we cannot see the inside of the costume. So can you really say for certain that the body was placed inside? Lang: ...Yeah, I'll give you that much. In that case, why don't we try examining it? The inside of that costume! There might be some traces left inside. Edgeworth: Mr. Powers, may we examine the inside of the costume? Powers: Sure. Go ahead. But it might be kinda stinky, since I sweat a lot in here... Edgeworth: This is... incredibly dirty. Powers: That's strange... We always make sure to clean it after using it, so that the sweat doesn't damage the costume. Lang: Lang: Isn't this just proof that someone besides you used this costume? I'd say that dirt from the body probably got into the costume. Kay: The president's body did fall on top of the monster's footprint. That must be where the dirt came from! Lang: ...Are you satisfied now? Add statement: \"There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, dirt got into the costume when the body was hidden inside. Wouldn't that mean... ...that the dirt was transferred from the body? Lang: Hah! Isn't that obvious? How else would you say it got there? Kay: ...There's dirt stuck everywhere inside the costume. It looks particularly bad around the chest area. Edgeworth: (Dirt around the chest...? We cannot overlook this fact.) Kay: Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense... Edgeworth: Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point. Kay: In that case, what should we do? Edgeworth: Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail.

I reckon... yer through bein' a prosecutor, right? Edgeworth: Yes... that's true, I suppose. (I'm no longer a prosecutor. However...) Kay: You can't stop thinking about what Mr. de Killer said, right? Edgeworth: Indeed... de Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Edgeworth: (This case isn't over yet... The person in the red hood who kidnapped Kay at Gourd Lake... And this letter from an unknown sender. Someone's schemes are at work behind this case...) Lotta: Must be tough havin' a case you just solved still naggin' at the back of yer mind. Well, I got some investigatin' of my own to be doin', so I'll be off! Kay: That's amazing! You've already decided on your next scoop? Lotta: What're ya sayin' there, missy!? Don't you be underestimatin' the likes of Lotta Hart! I've covered a lotta scoops, ya know? I always have an extra scoop or two up my sleeves... ???: S-Someone! Help! Kay: Yikes! What's that!? ???: S-Someone! P-Please help! Edgeworth: (Hmm. This woman is...) What's happened!? ???: S-Somebody's dead! A m-monster...! Edgeworth: (A... monster?) Lotta: I-It's a scoop! A scoop's callin' me! ???: Please follow me! It's this way! Kay: Has something else happened? Again!? Edgeworth: I don't know... At any rate, we should follow her for now. Kay: Eh!? These are...!? Lotta: G-Genuine hoofprints! Edgeworth: (Hoofprints? Impossible! No animal could be this large...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Look! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang...! Why is he here?) Kay: Ah! Someone's on the ground! Edgeworth: (It can't be... The president of Zheng Fa... Di-Jun Huang!) Lang: ........ Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Lang: ......Mr. Prosecutor. Didn't take you long to get here. Edgeworth: What happened? Lang: What... happened? Ha! That's what I'd like to know! Edgeworth: (It would seem that he's in a considerable amount of shock over the president's death. However... ...what exactly are these giant footprints...? And what could have happened to the president?) Lotta: It's a m... m... monster! Edgeworth: A... monster? Lotta: Yessiree! Lookie here! Ain't no doubt about it, these are clearly the footprints of a monster! On this day, mankind received a grim reminder: we live in fear of the Mighty Moozilla! Edgeworth: (Mighty... Moozilla...?) Lotta: This here's a scoop! I got myself a scoop! \"Man Trampled to Death by Monster!\" I reckon it'll be the top story in tomorrow's paper! Edgeworth: (What nonsense... There are no such things as monsters... Wait, it can't be...?) Huang: I am Di-Jun Huang. I have heard of your deeds. You saved my country from a great crisis. Edgeworth: The real assassin was you all along...! de Killer: That is correct. I received a request from a key individual... ...to take the president's life... Edgeworth: (That man... could he have...?) Lang: Hey, you! Were you the first to discover the body? ???: Y-Yes, I...! Umm, well. Edgeworth: (! Agent Lang?) Lang: Lang Zi says: \"First come, first suspected.\" You! Did you really just discover the body!? ???: O-O-O-O-O-Of course! Kay: Please calm down! You're scaring her! Edgeworth: (He does seem to have lost his composure...) Lang: Tch. Calm down!? How am I supposed to calm down? Do you know who's been murdered!? Di-Jun Huang... the president of Zheng Fa! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. This isn't like you. Lang: ! Edgeworth: When we first met, you had an army of subordinates under your command... ...and you boasted of having the highest arrest rate in Interpol. And what now? Did you forget the fundamentals of investigation along with all of your men? Lang: What... did you say...? Edgeworth: Instead of questioning people at random, you should investigate the crime scene first. Am I wrong? Lang: ........Tch! I don't need you to tell me that. ...I'll do a thorough investigation. Edgeworth: (Well. At least it seems he's calmed for now...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Let's investigate too! Edgeworth: Yes. Let us investigate. (Right now, I do not have any investigation rights, but until the police arrive...) Lotta: What're y'all sayin'? Ain't it obvious who dunnit!? The man behind it all is the Mighty Moozilla! Hm? Well, I guess it ain't the \"man\" behind it, more like the \"monster\" behind it, ya know? Edgeworth: Good grief... Could you please just try not to interfere with the investigation? Lotta: Shut yer trap! Yer the one who better not be stickin' yer nose in my business! I ain't forgivin' ya if ya mess up my scoop! ???: Umm... Excuse me. Edgeworth: (Hmm. It's the woman who first discovered the body. I feel like I've seen her before...) ???: You're... Mr. Edgeworth, right? Do you remember me? Edgeworth: Umm. Y-Yes. That case... from before... Kay: Huh? Do you know her? Edgeworth: Yes, I do. (At least I think I do...) Kay: My name's Kay Faraday! I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! Penny: My. You have such a cute assistant? I'm Penny Nichols. I'm an assistant at Global Studios. I'm in charge of the props and sets. It's nice to meet you. Edgeworth: (Yes, that was it... I once handled a case that occurred during the filming of the Steel Samurai. This woman was a member of the show's staff, and she was involved in the incident. I must have met with her on numerous occasions over the course of the case... ...but to be honest, I had completely forgotten about her...) It's nice to see you again. The fact that you are here must mean that this place is... Penny: Yes! This is sort of an outdoor film lot for Global Studios. They're shooting a movie here right now. I was the first to arrive today, to set everything up for the filming... ...but everything seemed strange... Those giant footprints... and that... d-dead body... Edgeworth: I see. We shall examine the body. At any rate, could you please contact the police? Penny: Y-Yes! Right away! Edgeworth: (I'll have to take the time to listen to her story later... First, let's examine the scene. There are many things besides the body that concern me. I'll need to examine every nook and cranny of this place...) (Connecting \"Stepped on by a monster?\" and \"Monster's head\" Logic leads to:) Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. I'm going to take my leave here for a bit. There's something I have to check... Edgeworth: (Agent Lang. I wonder if he's caught onto something?) Hm? ???: ........ ........ Lang: ........ ???: .....Move it. Lang: What'd you say? Guess you're just a brat with no manners. ???: ...And you're an annoying old man. Quit your yapping already. Lang: ! Penny: I-I'm terribly sorry! Come on, Shaun! Lang: Tch! Penny: Oh! What were you doing!? ???: .......Who was that? Penny: Someone from the police! Why'd you suddenly pick a fight with him? ???: Hmph. Kay: That sure was a tense standoff! Edgeworth: (He didn't budge an inch, even before Agent Lang...) Penny: Ah! Allow me to introduce you! This is Shaun Fenn. He's the lead actor in our movie. Edgeworth: (The lead actor... is this child?) Kay: Hi! I'm Kay Faraday. Nice to meet you! Edgeworth: And this is Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth. Shaun: .......Prosecutor? Penny: He's a pretty famous prosecutor, you know. Shaun: But he's not wearing a prosecutor's badge. Edgeworth: Gah! (He's frightfully perceptive...) Penny: Ah! Shaun, it's probably better if you didn't go over there... Shaun: ............ Edgeworth: (That's certainly not a sight a child should see... However, he is someone involved with the case. I'll need to speak with him later.) (Connecting all possible Logic, examining ground around the body, original Moozilla model and table, clearing all \"Talk\" options of Penny and Shaun, and talking with Lotta leads to:) Edgeworth: And with that, this portion of the investigation seems to be finished. Kay: So the murder weapon really is... Edgeworth: Yes. As it stands now, the possibility that it was the monster head is quite high. Kay: So he ended up being squashed by the falling head, huh... Edgeworth: Hm? Lang: Although they're extremely late to the party, the bodyguards and the police have finally arrived. Bodyguard: Mr. President! Lang: They really were... far too late. Bodyguard: Damn it! Who did this!? Lang: ...They'll pay for this. I swear I'll make them pay. But you know, this much is enough to put me at ease. The person who did this to Huang... ...I've already got my eye on a suspect. Edgeworth: What? What do you mean? Lang: Even though Huang was the victim, he doesn't have extraterritorial rights here. Your country's police have the right to investigate. However, I've already spoken with them. As an agent of Interpol, they're letting me assist in the investigation... Edgeworth: ...So they've already established a plan for this investigation? Lang: I've already found my prey. Now it's time for the hunt... ...Take a look at this. It's a printout from a security camera on the Grand Tower rooftop. Edgeworth: Th... This is! Lang: This camera records people as they get off the rooftop elevator. And guess who was recorded? The president and his killer can be clearly seen! Kay: Wh-Why is Ms. Gravelle there!? Edgeworth: (So he's saying Judge Gravelle is the murder?) Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste! Edgeworth: (Could she, who hates crime more than anyone, have...?) Security Camera Photo jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. I'd like to hear your thoughts. Lang: Lang: ............ Just now, I heard a rumor at the Grand Tower. Miles Edgeworth, that you... are no longer a \"prosecutor\". Edgeworth: ! Lang: Naturally, that means you don't even have a shred of investigate authority. So what would be the point of having a logic battle with someone like you? Edgeworth: (Hmph...!) Kay: Why would you say something like that!? Didn't you also just get reduced to being a lone agent!? Lang: .......... Hey. Answer me this. Even though you've lost your position as a \"prosecutor\"... ...why are you sticking your neck into this case? Edgeworth: ........ (Why do I still continue to investigate...?) Agent Lang... Why are you pursuing the criminal who murdered the president? Because you're an Interpol agent? Lang: .......... Edgeworth: Right now, I am also chasing after a certain person. Someone in the shadows, who was behind the murder at the Grand Tower yesterday... Someone who placed Kay in grave danger. ...Even now, they are lurking somewhere, laughing at us. We will uncover the truth, and bring them to justice... ...and a title such as \"prosecutor\" has nothing to do with it. As long as the truth remains hidden... ...I will continue to seek out that truth. For that is a part of my creed. Lang: ........Haha! You... You're always trying to be so clever, but you really are kind of an idiot. Edgeworth: (Hmph. Me, an idiot? How rude...) Lang: That's the answer I wanted to hear. ...Alright, I'll play along with you for a bit. I've lost all my men, and you've lost your title. And yet, we still continue to investigate... Let's begin this battle of logic between two kindred spirits! Edgeworth: You have my thanks... Lang: However, I won't go easy on you. I'll definitely catch the criminal who murdered Huang. And I won't let you get in my way! Edgeworth: Yes... I wouldn't have it any other way! Lang: Let me show you the truth that this wolf has sunk his fangs into! Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower. Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president! Edgeworth: It was just the two of them alone on the rooftop... No bodyguards? Lang: Yeah. I confirmed it with those bodyguards over there. They didn't know about it either. Guess he managed to give them the slip. He must've had something secret to talk about. Edgeworth: (President Huang and Judge Gravelle... Did those two have some sort of connection?) Lang: Apparently, he had an arrangement with the owner of the Grand Tower. He requested the entrance to the viewing platform be restricted so that they could be alone. Well, it's not like the owner could turn down a request from the president. Kay: Does that mean... the last person to see the president was... Lang: Exactly... Gravelle, you mean? It's gotta be her! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang's reasoning is certainly sound... However, he has overlooked one major thing...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower. Lang: Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. Lang: At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. Lang: There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang has overlooked something major...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Edgeworth: Shi-Long Lang... For the Interpol agent with the highest arrest rate to have fallen so low. Lang: What'd you say...!? Edgeworth: This is a commemorative photo taken by the staff at Global Studios. Kay: Everyone's got such great smiles! ...Well, except for Shaun. Edgeworth: This photo was taken yesterday. Lang: What!? Edgeworth: If Judge Gravelle had murdered the president two days ago... ...then his body should have been there when this photo was taken! Lang: Owwoooooooh! Lang: Heh. Perhaps you should have listened a bit more carefully to those involved in the case. Questioning witnesses is one of the basic fundamentals of an investigation, is it not? Kay: I've captured Mr. Edgeworth's great smile! You really do look most alive when you're cornering your opponent! Lang: Grr... Just as I expected. It's been a while since I've felt like this. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, haven't you been a little hasty in your reasoning? Lang: ........Tch. I don't need your advice. Lang Zi says: \"The wrath of a wolf lasts a hundred years.\" My anger towards the woman who killed the president cannot be suppressed. Edgeworth: I, too, wish to capture the culprit. However... ...there is no doubt that the body appeared here last night. Therefore... the president could not have fallen to his death. Kay: Yeah! He was crushed by the monster head! Edgeworth: The crime occurred here at the film lot, not on the rooftop of the Grand Tower. Lang: Lang: So, that's what you think. Still, I don't intend to stray from my logic either. Edgeworth: However, he could not have fallen to his death two nights ago. This photo proves that... Lang: Is that so? Think about it this way... Two nights ago, Gravelle pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body. Edgeworth: In here? Lang: Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Once we search this area, we'll know where she hid the body. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Unfortunately, there is no need for a search. Lang: What'd you say!? Edgeworth: This piece of evidence proves that Judge Gravelle could not have hidden the body! Edgeworth: All the entrances to the film lot were locked. The chain on the back entrance was only cut last night. Lang: What!? Edgeworth: Therefore, Judge Gravelle could not have entered the film lot two nights ago! Lang: Aiyaaaaa! But the president could only have fallen two nights ago! Edgeworth: ...Why are you so insistent that the crime occurred two days ago? Lang: Why...? Because there's still more to the security camera footage. Lang: A photo was recorded 10–20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman. That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone. After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all! There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there? Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is! Edgeworth: The president never came down from the rooftop? Lang: That's right. The security camera is always watching the entrance of the elevator. It was specifically set up to record anyone who entered or exited the rooftop. Essentially, the camera created a locked room... one which the president vanished from! Edgeworth: (A locked room... I see. This is quite an unfavorable piece of evidence for Judge Gravelle...) Security Camera Photo data updated in my Organizer. Kay: A rooftop escape! That's a difficult feat! Edgeworth: So even the Yatagarasu can't just fly through the sky. Kay: That's right. I... I still need more training to be able to pull that off. Edgeworth: (Are you saying you're going to train yourself to fly?) Lang: A photo was recorded 10–20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman. Lang: That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone. Lang: After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all! Lang: There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there? Lang: Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is! Edgeworth: (A locked room created by the security camera... Is falling off the roof really the only way to escape this locked room?) Edgeworth: As a matter of fact, there was one. A hidden route... that is. Lang: A way down without using the elevator!? You'd better not tell me he flew off or something! Edgeworth: There's no need for that. It's quite simple. The president just needed to know... ...about the existence of the hidden 51st floor. Lang: The 51st floor? Edgeworth: This building has a hidden 51st floor. It is accessible through a secret hatch on the rooftop. Using that route, it would be possible to leave the rooftop without using the elevator. Lang: Lang: Hidden room? Secret hatch? How could the president have even known about that? Edgeworth: I wonder? I don't know the answer myself. I am merely raising a possibility. Lang: In the first place, what's this all about? This hidden 51st floor. Sounds like something that ninja girl over there would love to get into! Kay: No way! I'm sick of that place! Edgeworth: (For Kay, that place only holds bad memories, after all.) The 51st floor was a secret storeroom for the black market auction. Its true purpose was only exposed yesterday. Lang: ...Black market auction? You... You aren't suggesting the president was involved in something like that, are you? Edgeworth: I have no proof. However, the possibility exists, does it not? Kay: Hmm. I wouldn't put it past that president. Lang: HOOOOOOOOOOWWWL! Kay: Eek! Lang: Impossible! The president would never...! He would never be involved in a black market auction! Edgeworth: (Wh... What's this?) Lang: You punks. Are you prepared? If you're gonna spout nonsense like that... I'll tear you into pieces! Kay: Eeeeeek! Edgeworth: (...She ran away.) Lang: You don't have any idea! The amount of respect that man has earned from his country's people! Edgeworth: (I see... We have seen the president's true colors. However, the people of Zheng Fa remain in the dark... Should I inform Agent Lang of the president's true nature? No. Telling him now would only further cloud his judgment...) I understand, Agent Lang. Please calm down. We spoke out of line... I apologize. Lang: ......Sorry. My emotions got the best of me. And Kay, how long do you plan on hiding? You can come out now. Kay: ...I'm sorry. Lang: ...It's fine. My anger is directed towards the president's killer. Lotta: Well, I'll be! Yer actually a pretty good guy, ain't ya? That loyalty to yer president! It's mighty admirable! Lang: Heh. What's it to you? Lotta: Aww, don't be like that. I've got some good news for ya, I reckon. Lang: What? Lotta: The president ain't never passed through the 51st floor. Ya can count on me! Lang: Really? Lotta: I was in the storeroom myself, and I saw it with my very own eyes! Edgeworth: (That's right... She snuck into the storeroom that day.) Lotta's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer. Lang: ...Thanks. ...Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: What is it? Lang: I don't intend to give the culprit a single step of leeway. No one's seen the president since he met with Gravelle two days ago. Edgeworth: That doesn't change the fact that the body wasn't here yesterday. If he were pushed off two days ago, it would be odd that he wasn't found until yesterday. I doubt a fall from the rood would take a whole day. Lang: I'll admit, there are a few things I still haven't figured out. Edgeworth: Regardless... there is one thing I am certain of. Kay: There is? Edgeworth: What exactly occurred here last night? I'm certain we'll have to look into that in order to uncover the truth. Kay: Because the body and the hoofprints could have only appeared last night, right? Officer: Agent Lang! We'd like to bring the body in for the autopsy... Lang: Huang..... It's in your hands. Make sure you show the proper respect. Officer: I also have one more thing to report... Lang: What is it? Officer: We found some footprints near the body! Umm... They were left within the area that looks like a monster's footprint. Edgeworth: (There were human footprints within the monster's footprint?) Lang: What kind of footprints? Officer: Sir! They were the footprints of a child! About the size of an elementary school student! Edgeworth: What!? Penny: Huh!? Kay: A-An elementary school student!? Wait... Could it be...? Edgeworth: (Who... was that?) Penny: U-Umm...! Edgeworth: (Ms. Nichols?) Penny: I... I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you! Please excuse my rudeness! Edgeworth: Is there something you want to say? (What is she so scared of?) Penny: I'm worried that you'll think poorly of me, but... ...please let me testify something! It's really important! Edgeworth: (That's not something you need to be so worried about...) What is it? Penny: Last night... I... I actually came here. Lang: What!? Penny: Eek! Edgeworth: Why did you come here? Penny: ...Well, I got a little worried, so I stopped by... ...to check up on Shaun. Edgeworth: Shaun... You mean Shaun Fenn? (As I thought...) Penny: Yes. Last night, umm... Shaun stayed here late in order to practice by myself. Kay: Wow! He's really dedicated! Penny: Well, this movie is the first time he's starring as the lead role, so... ...I'm sure he wants to do his best...! Edgeworth: (She must have witnessed something last night...) When was this? Penny: Umm... If I remember correctly, I think it was a little past 10 PM. It looked like it was going to rain, and I was getting worried, so I came to check up on him. And when I got here... Well... I, umm... Lang: You... saw something? Penny: .....Y-Yes. Shaun was practicing by himself... ...and right above his head... I saw... a long... long... neck. Kay: A neck? Penny: Y-Yes! Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile... It was like... the neck of a dinosaur! Lotta: Whooooooahhh there! C-Could that've been... ...G-G-Gourdy!? Last time I went huntin' for it, it was a bust... but I reckon, this could be the real deal! Kay: What!? So this time it's Gourdy!? Penny: Th-That's right! I was really surprised! A-After all, Shaun is the boy who can communicate with Moozilla! Lotta: Yeah! That's right! Them horns of his lets him hear what the monster's sayin', right? Penny: E-Even so! He was looking up at Gourdy's face and he was talking to it! It was like they were friends! D-Doesn't that sound weird!? Lotta: You said it, sister! That's pretty darn strange, I reckon! That boy's a little traitor! Edgeworth: (...It seems she's gotten reality mixed up with the movies...) Lang: Hey, Missy... Did you really see that? Penny: Yes! But I was so shocked, I immediately ran home after that. Lang: What do you make of this, Mr. Prosecutor? Has another monster taken the stage? Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Do you really believe this absurd testimony? Lang: Hahahahaha! I couldn't care less about the monsters. However, it looks like who we need to talk to next has been decided now, hasn't it? Edgeworth: Shaun Fenn... He was here last night. It's very likely he saw something... isn't it? Lang: Atta boy! Lang: Shaun Fenn...! We've got some questions for you! ................ Penny: U-Umm... Shaun kind of left a while ago. Lang: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Kay: L-Let's go after him! Lang: Tch! Where'd he run off to!? Edgeworth: He might have just gone back home. Kay: That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today! Lang: ...Or he may have run away. Kay: A-Aren't you just overthinking things? Edgeworth: He's still a child. I can't imagine that he could have murdered the president by himself. Lang: Who said he was alone? Maybe that monster helped him. That boy can summon a monster to his aid, right? Edgeworth: Hmph. Very funny. Lang: I'm not saying that kid's definitely the culprit. But right now, he's the most prominent witness we have, So, we'll need to find that brat. Gumshoe: Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Kay: Ah! Gummy! Gumshoe: Uuugh... I, I... I...! Kay: He ran away... Edgeworth: (What is the detective doing...?) Lang: It doesn't matter... It's not like I can rely on this country's police anyways. Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. Do you intend to continue investigating by yourself? Lang: Yeah. That's right. You got a problem with that? Kay: Didn't you always have a small army of subordinates with you before? Lang: That's right... But, you know, being a lone wolf isn't all that bad. You don't have to worry about your subordinates or partners. All you need are your fangs. Simple, right? Edgeworth: (Subordinates... and partners...?) Lang: Well then. I'll be seeing you two. Lotta: He he he he. Things are gettin' interestin'! I reckon I'm about to get real busy myself! After all, I got me a pair of monsters to hunt! I'm definitely gettin' my hands on this scoop! Kay: Things have gotten pretty crazy, haven't they? Edgeworth: Indeed. There's the footprints of Moozilla, and now the shadow of Gourdy... It's almost exactly like the movie. Kay: How about we go monster hunting too? Edgeworth: Well... (Hm? Isn't that...?) Kay: Isn't that one of Lang's men...? Edgeworth: (He's one of Agent Lang's subordinates. We met him during another case.) Excuse me... MIB: Oh, Prosecutor Edgeworth. It has been a while. Kay: Shouldn't you be following Mr. Lang? MIB: Agent Lang... Shifu... is no longer my boss. Edgeworth: What exactly happened? MIB: Do you remember the incident from one month ago? Edgeworth: (The \"Yatagarasu Incident\" we had been involved with.) MIB: Agent Lang made a major mistake back then. He almost aided and abetted a dangerous criminal. Edgeworth: (Certainly... it had come quite close to that at the time.) MIB: Shifu took responsibility for what happened... and our team was disbanded. Kay: Disbanded...? Edgeworth: So that's what Agent Lang was talking about when he said he had become a lone wolf. Kay: Then... Why are you here? MIB: That's..... Well. I was a little worried about Shifu. ...It seems that even now, he's still chasing after them. The ghosts of 12 years past... Edgeworth: Ghosts of 12 years past? Just what are you... MIB: .......... I'm sorry. I've already said too much. If you'll excuse me... Edgeworth: (These ghosts Agent Lang is chasing after... Do they also have something to do with this case?) Kay: Looks like everyone's left now... So, what do we do now? Edgeworth: Well... Ms. Hart is going after the monsters, and Agent Lang is going after Shaun. We should also try approaching this case from a different angle. Kay: What angle would that be? Edgeworth: ...We should listen to what Judge Gravelle has to say. Kay: Ah! That's right! If I'm not mistaken, Ms. Gravelle is... Gravelle: ...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Fifi Laguarde's trial. Kay: She said that she had a trial coming up! Edgeworth: Indeed. Let's head to the courthouse as well. Kay: 'Kay! To be continued. Gravelle: Court is now in session. Is the defense ready? Ray: Of course, Your Honor! We can begin whenever you want. Franziska: The prosecution has been ready from the start, Your Honor. Edgeworth: Jill Crane, the attorney in charge of the defense, has passed on from this world. Furthermore, Sebastian Debeste, the prosecutor-in-charge, has disappeared... And so, Franziska and Mr. Shields have taken over their duties. Gravelle: Before we begin, I would like to apologize for the delay of today's trial. As the crime took place in the prison, a place where justice is normally administered... ...and the defendant was the warden of the prison, further exacerbating the situation... ...additional time was specially arranged to investigate and prepare for the trial. In addition, the defense attorney in charge of the case, Jill Crane, has recently passed away... Due to these circumstances, the trial was further delayed. Mr. Shields, Ms. von Karma. At this time, I'd like to give you my gratitude for taking up this responsibility on short notice. Ray: I guess this is the last job Gravelle-pie's friend left behind for us, huh? Well, Uncle Ray's more than happy to help out. Although having said that, I only had enough time to skim through the case files... Are you OK on your end, Franny-pie? Franziska: What kind of prosecutor abandons his own case and vanishes without a trace...!? I won't allow any more delays in this trial while we wait for that foolish man to return. I have received the evidence just now. There should be no problem continuing the trial. Gravelle: ...You have my thanks. And with that, I hereby call the defendant, Fifi Laguarde, to the stand. Laguarde: ........ Gravelle: Now then, will the prosecution please give us their opening statement? Franziska: Very well, Your Honor. The defendant... Laguarde: ...Please wait, Your Honor. Gravelle: What is it? Laguarde: Well, there's something I'd like you to fill me in on. Just what exactly... am I doing in a place like this? Gravelle: Then perhaps... you would do well to listen to the opening statement. Laguarde: Hmm. So if I listen to it, I'll get it, huh? OK then, let's hear it. Franziska: ...That was the plan from the start. Now, if you would kindly shut up and listen. The incident occurred in the detention center and the prison Warden Laguarde is in charge of. The victim is Horace Knightley, who was being held in the detention center. The prosecution is certain that this woman here is the culprit. This knife, the murder weapon, is the decisive evi..... Huh!? Gravelle: Ms. von Karma. Is something wrong? Franziska: Th-That's... impossible! The evidence is...! Ray: What's wrong with the evidence, Franny-pie? Franziska: The evidence... the knife's gone! The chisel with Kanis's bell attached to it is missing too! Ray: Wh... Whaaat!? Gravelle: Order! Order! Prosecutor von Karma. What is the meaning of this? Franziska: I... I don't understand it either, Your Honor. Laguarde: If there's no evidence, then I suppose there's not much reason for me to be here. Some prosecutor. Can't even hold on to one little piece of evidence. What a dunce. Franziska: I... I only received everything that the previous prosecutor had... Ah! Ray: ...It appears the culprit is that pampered prosecutor, the Boy Blunder. Hey, Gravelle-pie. Gravelle: What is it? Ray: Your Honor! Considering our predicament, what say we postpone the trial until later? Gravelle: Gravelle: The defense's proposal is overruled. Ray: Eh? Gravelle-pie...? Laguarde: I know, right? It'd be troubling for me if this trial were to be delayed any further. I just want everyone to know that I'm innocent. As soon as possible. Franziska: Franziska: Innocent!? I've had more than enough of your foolish... Laguarde: And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... \"In court, evidence is everything.\" Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor? Gravelle: .......... That is correct. Franziska: Eh! Ray: What!? Gravelle: The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Fifi Laguarde... Ray: Ray: Hold your horses, Gravelle-pie! You can't just declare her innocent all of a sudden! Gravelle: Is something the matter? For the defense to object to a \"not guilty\" verdict... Ray: Well, I mean... Even you must know that the warden over there is guilty, right? You were there with us when we found the murder weapon! Gravelle: ........ Mr. Shields. A judge must remain impartial when handing down a verdict. That is why I cannot allow myself to get caught up in my own personal feelings... The person who was present when the murder weapon was discovered... ...and the judge sitting before you now, are two completely different people. Ray: ...You're kidding, right? Gravelle: I can only hand down a verdict based upon the evidence that was presented. Franziska: Franziska: There is evidence! It's just... Well, it's not here right now, but... A few minutes, that's all I need! I'll find the evidence and return to court, without fail! The prosecution requests a brief recess, Your Honor! Gravelle: ........ Ray: Th-The defense would also like a recess, Your Honor. Gravelle-pie. Please... Gravelle: ........ ...I understand. I shall grant your request. Laguarde: Well! Verity-darling! Aren't you wishy-washy today? Gravelle: This court will now adjourn for a 15 minute recess! During with, the prosecution and the defense shall prepare for the resumption of the trial. Franziska: ...Understood, Your Honor. Ray: Phew. That was a close one. Gravelle: Court is now adjourned! Kay: Didn't we find it together!? The evidence! Edgeworth: Yes, we certainly did. Gumshoe: Huh? Edgeworth: What's the matter, Detective? Gumshoe: It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator. Kay: Really! Why? Edgeworth: (Of course, that's why the metal detector reacted!) Judge Gravelle, I'd like you to take a look at this. Gravelle: The chisel...? Debeste: Wasn't that just the fake murder weapon? Edgeworth: Kanis hid this chisel inside this dog's mouth. And the real murder weapon was hidden in very much the same way... Laguarde: ...! Edgeworth: The real murder weapon is in the pond, inside the alligator! Edgeworth: I wonder if it was stolen by someone... ???: Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Ms. Berry and Mr. Saint. Did you come to attend the trial? Regina: I came because I heard there's a really fun show around here! So, where is it? Simeon: The trial for the case I got caught up in was supposed to have already started, but... ..our practice ran a little late. I believe it was somewhere around here, wasn't it? Kay: Actually, two key pieces of evidence have gone missing: the chisel and the knife... The trial is in recess now. Sort of like an intermission. You just missed it, Simeon. Simeon: Wha... Whaaaaaat!? Wh-wh-wh-what's that supposed to mean!? Regina: Ah ha ha! Looks like Simeon's going to get arrested again! Simeon: Eeeeeeeeeek! Nowaynowaynoway, I can't...! Kay: Hmm. I guess Simeon is his usual noisy self. ...Huh? ???: To think that I would be humiliated like this! Edgeworth: ...And here comes another noisy individual. Ray: Now, now, Franny-pie. Let's just take a moment and calm down a bit. Maybe you could put that whip of yours away, him? Whaddaya say? Franziska: That foolish prosecutor! When I get my hands on him... ...my whip is going to give him the thrashing of a lifetime! Ray: Eek! Miles, why don't you try talking to her? Edgeworth: (Good grief... On that note, I guess I should probably hear what she has to say.) (Clearing all \"Talk\" options of Franziska and Ray leads to:) Ray: If only there were someone who could go search for the evidence for us... ........ Edgeworth: ........ .....Very well. I'll go look for them. Ray: Oh! Miles! You'd do that for us? Edgeworth: Of course, finding the evidence within fifteen minutes will be no easy task. Ray: Well, if worse comes to worst, Uncle Ray and Franny-pie will help you stall for time. Franziska: .......... Ray: Until you recover the evidence, we won't let her hand down a verdict. Edgeworth: Please do so. ...Franziska, are you OK with this? Franziska: .....You're asking me, Franziska von Karma, to help you out? You'd be better off spending the rest of your life as an anchorman for the local news... Ray: Ms. von Karma. This is an emergency. We could really use your cooperation. Franziska: ! Hmph... I understand. As acting prosecutor, I, along with that attorney over there, shall continue this trial. Meanwhile, you, the \"former\" prosecutor shall run around and look for the evidence... ...all for my sake. It's a job that suits you perfectly! Edgeworth: ...I'm glad that you're on board. Simeon: I-I'll help out too! ...'Cause I really don't wanna get arrested again. Regina: This sounds like fun! Regina wants to tag along too! Edgeworth: Alright. That would be helpful. Now then, where should we begin? Kay: I think we should go find that person, and hear what they have to say! Edgeworth: Who should we talk to in order to learn where the evidence went? Edgeworth: Yes. The person in charge of the evidence was Sebastian Debeste. Simeon: Ah, you mean that rookie prosecutor, right? Got it! Edgeworth: I'll leave him to you. Ray: Alright. Time for Uncle Ray to have a strategy meeting with the opposing counsel. ...Just the two of uUUAAAGH! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... You better not keep me waiting. Lest you end up like your friend here. Edgeworth: Yes.... I'll keep that in mind. Ray: Franny-pie, wait for meeeee! Edgeworth: Now then, let's go help look for Sebastian as well. Kay: Ah! Edgeworth: (Judge Gravelle...) Gravelle: ...If it isn't Prosecutor Edgeworth. I hope that all is well. Kay: All is NOT well! Just what was going on in that trial earlier...? Edgeworth: Kay! There's no need for that. Kay: But...! Even though Ms. Gravelle should know exactly who the culprit is... What made you...? Gravelle: ........ In a court of law, the only thing that truly matters is evidence... Whatever my own feelings may be, it should not affect the verdict. Edgeworth: So, is this the \"Judge persona\" of Verity Gravelle we're seeing? Gravelle: Cold-blooded and heartless... It's fine if you think of me as such. Edgeworth: (Even as a judge, she's still this stubborn?) Judge Gravelle. There's just... one thing I'd like to ask you. Gravelle: And what would that be? Edgeworth: Two nights ago... you went to the roof of the Grand Tower. Gravelle: ! The roof... you say? Edgeworth: You met with the president there, correct? The two of you were caught on the security camera. Gravelle: Is there some sort of problem with that? Edgeworth: Today... The president's body was discovered. Very close to the Grand Tower. Gravelle: Th-That's...! Edgeworth: You understand now, don't you? You're a suspect. ...What happened between you and the president up on the roof? Gravelle: Nothing... We merely spoke for a few minutes. Once our business was done, I headed straight home. I took the elevator back down alone. Edgeworth: Indeed. That was shown on the security camera footage as well. What exactly did you and the president talk about? Gravelle: Th-That... I cannot say. Edgeworth: (I see. However, I cannot afford to let up just yet. That being the case... Heh. I guess my only remaining options is to use that. She is definitely hiding something...! And I'm going to draw it out of her!) Edgeworth: Two nights ago, Judge Gravelle met with President Huang... Gravelle: ........ Gravelle: ...It is true that I spoke with President Huang on the roof of the Grand Tower. However, we only discussed business. There is no need to tell you what was said. Edgeworth: Hmm... Just like in the trial earlier, she won't reveal her personal feelings easily. When she's speaking as a judge, it would be better for me to wait and see what develops. Now then, I'll start by asking her what she talked about with the president! Edgeworth: Could you tell me... what you and the president talked about? Gravelle: My meeting with the president was strictly business. And since it has nothing to do with you, I am not obligated to answer your question. Edgeworth: ...... Gravelle: I appreciate your understanding. Edgeworth: Even so... You certainly are a very busy person, aren't you? You're a member of the P.I.C. and a judge as well. You even assist with the investigations. Gravelle: I am simply fulfilling the professional duties that have been assigned to me. Edgeworth: Was your meeting with the president also one of the duties assigned to you as a judge? Gravelle: .....Yes. Of course it was. I... am one who lives for the law. I would never act outside my professional duties. Edgeworth: This morning, you returned Kay's \"promise notebook\" to me. I don't believe that all of yours actions are simply done for the sake of your duties. Gravelle: .....It's true, it seems I still retain some immature qualities. Edgeworth: I wouldn't call it immature. It was your own personal kindness. Weren't you also distressed when you found out the president had passed away? Gravelle: Yes... It is very unfortunate... Why did he have to die...? Edgeworth: It seems he was crushed by the head of a monster called the \"Mighty Moozilla\". Ah... Excuse me. You see, Moozilla is... Gravelle: I-Is that true!? You mean... the president died at the temporary Moozilla film lot...? Edgeworth: Yes. That's right... I'm surprised that you know about Moozilla. Gravelle: Y-Yes... I had heard about it from Sebastian. He told me that the movie was being filmed near the Grand Tower... Edgeworth: ...She seems awfully shaken up about that. And I'm also curious about Sebastian, who went missing along with the evidence. She said she wouldn't talk about the president... However, I might be able to get her to reveal her secret through another line of questioning. She is flustered beyond normal. There must be some reason behind it! Edgeworth: Franziska may have taken over the prosecution in Sebastian's place, however... ...as long as he still possesses some of the evidence, the trial cannot proceed. Gravelle: I intend to carry out a fair trial. If the prosecution is unable to present evidence... the defendant must be declared not guilty. Edgeworth: ...... Gravelle: I am a judge. I cannot allow my own personal feelings to get in the way. Edgeworth: So, you're saying you're not the least bit worried about Sebastian's whereabouts? Gravelle: Of course... I am... I am worried about Sebastian, as well, but... Edgeworth: You're worried about Sebastian \"as well\"? Wouldn't that mean... ...that there is someone else you're worried about? Gravelle: Ah...! Edgeworth: By any chance... would that person have something to do with your unnatural behavior? Gravelle: ...That's impossible. I... ...I am a follower of the law... I will not... be swayed by... personal feelings. Edgeworth: It may be true that those who stand in court have a duty to follow the law. However, we're not superheroes! You and I are only human. It is impossible to completely ignore your own feelings and render an impartial judgement! Gravelle: Aaaaaaah! .....It is as you say. As I am now... I cannot hand down an impartial verdict. Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Why don't you tell me the truth? Gravelle: I... I...! Just what am I supposed to do...!? Edgeworth: For Judge Gravelle to become this distraught... I should find out exactly who she is searching for. Up until now, she has been wearing the mask of a judge... This time, I should be able to draw out her true feelings! Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: Earlier, when Moozilla was brought up, it seemed to be a sensitive topic for you... Is that \"child\" you spoke of involved with the Moozilla movie? Gravelle: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! H-How!? How do you know that...!? Edgeworth: You're usually so calm, yet you seem rather distraught right now. Please, tell me... Who is that child!? Gravelle: ...I understand. If you've come to know this much... I shall prepare myself for the worst. The child I'm searching for... is a boy by the name of Shaun Fenn. Edgeworth: Shaun...? Why do you want to know his whereabouts? Gravelle: Well... That much, I simply cannot say... Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Didn't you say you were prepared for the worst!? Gravelle: .....! Edgeworth: Even if you don't intend to talk, I am determined to expose the truth. ...That is my resolve. Why is she searching for Shaun... I must get her to tell me the reason. Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: I don't know what kind of relationship you have with Shaun... ...but at the very least, the two of you must be acquaintances! Gravelle: E... Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Won't you allow us to help you in your search for him? Gravelle: Help...? No, that won't be allowed? Edgeworth: Who won't allow it? The so-called Goddess of Law? Gravelle: ...The person who knows where that child is.. Edgeworth: I see... Finally, I've connected all the pieces of the puzzle. The reason why you cannot easily talk about Shaun... It was because... Someone kidnapped him, isn't that right? Gravelle: A-Aah... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: ...Judge Gravelle. I would like to hear the truth from your own lips. Gravelle: .....I understand. This time... I will truly be prepared for the worst. It is just as you deduced... Someone has kidnapped Shaun. Edgeworth: ! As I thought... There was a kidnapping! Still, how is Shaun's kidnapping related to you in any way? Gravelle: ......Shaun and I are... ...mother and child... Edgeworth: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? I was unable to learn much about the conversation she had with the president, but... ...I have learned of Shaun's kidnapping. ...It was an unexpected result, but with that... it's checkmate. Gravelle: ....... Kay: Whaaat!? J-Shaun is... Ms. Gravelle's son!? No way! I mean, he's already so big, for him to be your... Gravelle: Yes... Shaun is indeed my son. Please look at this... Edgeworth: (This is a clipping from a magazine...) Kay: It's an article about Shaun! Do you always carry this around with you? Gravelle: Yes. I always keep it close by. It's like a charm to me... Edgeworth: (It seems the bond that they share is a strong one.) Gravelle: ....... Edgeworth: However, are you absolutely certain that he's been kidnapped? Gravelle: Yes. I received a call from the kidnapper just before the trial started... Edgeworth: What were their demands? Gravelle: They had only one demand. A \"Not Guilty\" verdict for Fifi Laguarde... Edgeworth: (I see. So that's what happened...) Laguarde: And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... \"In court, evidence is everything.\" Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor? Gravelle: .......... That is correct. The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Fifi Laguarde... Edgeworth: So, that's why you were going to deliver a \"Not Guilty\" verdict earlier? Gravelle: I am... not qualified to be a judge... A judge must be able to remain impartial and composed, above all else. And yet... despite this, in the trial just now, I... ...I was about to hand down a verdict that was led solely by my heart! Edgeworth: .....Judge Gravelle. Gravelle: The Goddess of Law must be furious with me... ...but, I simply couldn't do it. I couldn't hand down a fair verdict... if it meant I had to sacrifice my own son! Kay: Of course you can't! Edgeworth: (Kay...) Kay: A real parent... would never abandon their own child! If that makes the Goddess of Law angry, then maybe the Goddess is the one who's wrong! The Goddess is guilty! Guilty! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Indeed. (To declare a goddess guilty...) We're responsible for upholding the law, but at the same time, we are only human. Nobody would hand down a verdict that would sacrifice their own child. Gravelle: .....Thank you very much. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth. However... I cannot simply run away from the courtroom. Bailiff: Judge Gravelle! So this is where you've been. Gravelle: It appears it's time... Kay: .......... Ms. Gravelle! ...My father, he was a prosecutor. Gravelle: Your father...? Kay: Yes. He stood in court, just like you. ...And now, with all that has happened, it got me thinking... What if, my father had been in the same position as you are now? Gravelle: If a prosecutor was being coerced into obtaining a guilty verdict... Kay: I know... if my life were on the line, my father... ...would definitely come to steal me back! Gravelle: Steal you... back? Kay: Ms. Gravelle. Why don't you let us take care of it? Gravelle: What...? Kay: I'm gonna go steal Shaun back for you! As the second Yatagarasu, I, Kay Faraday, give you my word! Gravelle: ...... Edgeworth: (Heh. So, the Great Thief Yatagarasu plans to steal the \"truth\", huh...) What say you, Judge Gravelle? Will you place your trust in our young Great Thief? Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth... Edgeworth: And, if it's alright with you, I wish to help as well. Gravelle: .....Thank you very much. I know that it's really not my place to ask this of you... ...but please... do whatever you can... Please save Shaun. Kay: You got it! Just leave everything to us! Gravelle: Allow me to leave my cellphone with you. You may get a call from the kidnapper at some point. Edgeworth: You have my word. I will ensure the safe return of your phone, alone with your son. Gravelle: And I will do everything in my power to prolong the trial. But... even then, at most the trial can only last for about two more hours... Edgeworth: (Two hours, huh... So, until 2 PM. That's our time frame...) Gravelle: ...I must return to court. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall leave the rest to you. Edgeworth: Heh. Kay, I thought you were taking a break from being the Great Thief? Kay: As of right now, the Great Thief Yatagarasu is back in business! Alright! Time to put on the gloves and hit the pavement! It's my first request, after all! Edgeworth: Is that so? In that case, we'd better begin our investigation posthaste... ...if we hope to track down Shaun... Lang: Tch! Where'd he run off to!? Edgeworth: He might have just gone back home. Kay: That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today! Lang: ...Or he may have run away. Edgeworth: We should probably begin our investigation from the front of the Grand Tower. Kay: H-Hey! Hold it, Mr. Edgeworth! You're not the one in charge anymore! From here on out, this is a job for a Great Thief! Which means, I'm the leader now! Edgeworth: ...If that's the case, then what am I supposed to do? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, you get to be... the first ever Great Thief's Assistant! Edgeworth: (So, I'm a thief's assistant now...?) Kay: Alright! Let's get going! The Great Thief Yatagarasu takes flight once again! Kay: Here we are! The scene of the crime! Let's get to work! Now, say it with me, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hm? Say what? Kay: \"Even in the depths of night...\" Edgeworth: .......... Kay: Aww, come on! Say the rest with me! Edgeworth: And just why should I do that!? Kay: Because! The Great Thief Yatagarasu has arrived on the scene! If we don't say the introduction, it just doesn't feel right! Edgeworth: I have no intention of becoming a thief. Kay: Aargh! Fine, then. I'll do it by myself! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: Yes, Kay. I know you are. I, on the other hand, am starting the investigation. Kay: Tch. You're no fun. Edgeworth: ...We don't have time for \"fun\". We only have until 2 o'clock. We need to begin making inquiries immediately. Kay: Good thing we have a photo, so we can go right ahead and start asking around! (Examining trailer after clearing all \"Talk\" options of Powers, blue truck, taxi, and film equipment and talking with officer leads to:) Edgeworth: (Hmm. It's already half past 12...) Kay: I wonder how Ms. Gravelle and the others are holding up... Edgeworth: How long will they be able to prolong the trial...? Kay: We gotta hurry and find Shaun! Edgeworth: Indeed. Lotta: Aww heck naw! That ain't how it's done! Ya ain't gonna catch a scoop like that! Nicole: S-Sorry, Chief! Lotta: What am I always tellin' ya!? We're beasts! Scoop-eatin' animals! It's scoop or starve! No story, no glory! Ya gotta get fired up! Nicole: Yessir! As expected of my mentor! Edgeworth: They're here... (It's those noisy reporters.) Kay: Hey, they came here too! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go talk to them! Edgeworth: ...Good grief. If we must. Edgeworth: What if the kidnappers stole the box? Kay: Ah! You mean they...! Edgeworth: Exactly. They took it in order to carry Shaun inside it. Kay: Shaun's a tiny kid, after all. Then, the reason the taxi driver didn't see Shaun was because... Edgeworth: It's likely he was put in the trunk as the kidnapper's luggage. Kay: But, why did they need to go through all the trouble of hiding him? Edgeworth: At first, the kidnappers must have intended to abduct him without being seen. However, they didn't anticipate all the policemen in the plaza. Kay: Ah, I see. If they tried to just walk away with him, they would've been spotted... Edgeworth: Just the mere presence of policemen would have been a sizable threat. Kay: I geddit! In that case, we've gotta ask the taxi driver! Edgeworth: Did the two men you told us about earlier have any luggage with them? Driver: Yeah. They stuffed a huge box into the trunk. Kay: Then that's that! Those guys must be the kidnappers! Edgeworth: Do you remember where you took those men? Driver: Sounds to me like something serious has gone down here... If you'd like, I could take you to the same place I took them. Kay: Let's do it, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes. Thank you for your help. Driver: No problemo! Just leave it to me! Kay: Uugh... That taxi drove way too fast. I don't feel too good. Edgeworth: ........ Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, are you alright? Your face is really pale. Edgeworth: I-I'm fine. The driver said they came to this house's garage... Kay: This must be where those two men brought the box! ...Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Look at the nameplate on the door! Edgeworth: Nameplate...? What!? \"Blaise Debeste\"!? Kay: So this is... the chairman's house! Edgeworth: (Does that mean the one who kidnapped Shaun was Blaise Debeste? Blaise should have already been arrested though...) Kay: Ah! The garage door is unlocked! Edgeworth: You really do have a good eye for this sort of thing... Edgeworth: (It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.) Kay: Excuse me... we're coming in... Anybody home? Edgeworth: Doing something like this, it's as if we're a couple of petty thieves...! Kay: Shh! Be quiet! Right now, we're Great Thieves! Have some self-awareness! Edgeworth: (...She scolded me.) Nobody's here... For now, it looks like we can get through this without being arrested. Kay: This isn't the time to be relieved! Now the real deal begins! Let's go look for treasure! Edgeworth: (We are looking for Shaun, not treasure...) (Examining the \"Cement bag\", \"Shovel and sledgehammer\", \"Gloves\" and \"Green box\" leads to:) ???: ...*thump, thump*... Edgeworth: Hm? Kay: Th-There's someone inside! ???: ...*thump, thump*... *thump, thump*... *CRASH*! Edgeworth: Is it... Shaun...? Kay: Shaun! We're coming to save you! ......Eh? Edgeworth: (Th-This is...!) You're..... S-Sebastian! Kay: Whaaaaat!? Why!? Debeste: Nnnnf, Nmmnnnmmf! Kay: This is Blaise's house, right? That would mean... Edgeworth: Yes. It should also be Sebastian's house. (So then, why is he...?) Kay, go help him out. Kay: If it has to do with ropes, just leave it to Kay! Here I go! A little pull over here, and a quick tug over there! Are you alright, Sebastian? Debeste: .......... Edgeworth: (He looks a little worse for wear.) Why were you tied up in a place like this? Debeste: .....How should I know!? Y-You guys don't know anything about me! Edgeworth: .....It's because we don't know. That's why we're asking you... Debeste: .......... Kay: He's completely shut off his heart... Edgeworth: Indeed... If it's come to this... ...I suppose I have no choice but to use that. Kay: Ah! You mean! Edgeworth: I hate to do this when he's in such a fragile state. It's like kicking a man who's down... Kay: ...Will it be alright? His mind might break if you corner him too much, y'know? Edgeworth: Yes. I am aware of that. I will try to be careful. (Good grief. I wonder how this will turn out... I've never held back against anyone before...) Edgeworth: After running out of the meeting room this morning, why would he be here of all places...? Debeste: You guys... You don't know how I feel! Edgeworth: (He's gone through a lot of shock. He must be on the verge of an emotional meltdown.) It can't be helped... At times like this, I must quietly listen to what he has to say. Debeste: N-No one tells me anything... I'm always the only one being left out like an idiot...! Edgeworth: (Hmm... I should try to answer his questions as best as I can.) Considering how fragile he is... I won't have much time to spare. I'll need to ask about his true feelings, and try to calm him down posthaste! Edgeworth: Could you please tell me what's on your mind? Debeste: I... I don't wanna! It's not like you'd listen to me anyways! Edgeworth: ..... Debeste: Wh-What's wrong? Normally, you'd be shouting \"Objection!\" right about now! Edgeworth: ..... Debeste: ...You're serious? Y-You're really... gonna listen to what I have to say? Edgeworth: I can understand... the shock you went through after what happened with your father. Debeste: It wasn't just Pops. This morning, I... I lost everything! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: E-Everything I have... was given to me by Pops... T-Tell me, Mr. Edgeworth... Just what am I supposed to believe in...? Edgeworth: If you can't believe in others, then at least believe in yourself. You'll need to gain experience on your own, but if you require wisdom, I can lend you a hand. Debeste: ! ...Ever since I got locked up, I've been thinking... ...am I too inculpable to be a prosecutor... uh? Incapable...? Erm, which one was it? Edgeworth: I believe \"incapable\" is the word you are looking for. Judging your own ability is not an easy task. Sebastian. Little by little, you are growing. Debeste: ! Edgeworth: Sebastian. Would you tell me your side of the story? Debeste: .....I-I understand. What... should I talk about? Edgeworth: Hmm. He seems to have calmed down slightly. I'd like you to tell me everything you know about the kidnappers. Now then... Tell me what you heard and saw! Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: Kidnapping his own son in order to demand a ransom wouldn't make such sense. Debeste: .....Y-Yeah, you're right! Edgeworth: Did you notice anything strange when you got kidnapped? Debeste: Oooh... As soon as I answered their question, they just took me away... Edgeworth: They asked you a question...? Tell me what they asked you! Debeste: Waaah! D-Don't glare at me like that... Erm... I think they asked me, \"Do you know Gravelle?\" Edgeworth: ! I see.. The pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall into place. Blaise... and the kidnappers did not intend to kidnap you. Their objective was Shaun Fenn. They were planning to kidnap Judge Gravelle's son... ...in order to have Fifi Laguarde declared not guilty! Debeste: J-Verity has a son...? And Warden Laguarde gets declared not guilty...? Edgeworth: I suspect... the kidnappers mistook you for Shaun Fenn. Debeste: A-All of this... was just a mistake? ! Wait... maybe that's why, back then...! Edgeworth: Hm...? Did you just remember something? Debeste: N-No..... It's nothing! I'm useless anyways... Just... leave me alone already! Edgeworth: Th-This is bad! He might be at his emotional limit...! I must get him to tell me what he remembered, and try to calm him down as well. Based on how distressed Sebastian looks right now... ...it must have been quite traumatic. I'll need to help him get back on his feet! Edgeworth: What did you remember just now? Debeste: I-I didn't remember anything... about Po... that guy... Edgeworth: Would \"that guy\" happen to be Blaise? Debeste: D-Darniiiiiit! Oooh... So this is the difference between me and someone who earned his Prosecutor title... Edgeworth: ...I've been waiting to ask you: Why did you become a prosecutor? Debeste: What does it matter!? I'm not fit to be a prosecutor anyways! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: S-Say something! Edgeworth: You must have some reason for choosing this path, right? Debeste: ...N-No, it's not like that! It wasn't anything special! I became a prosecutor for a really insignificant reason! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: It was just... a personal reason. Edgeworth: Heh... Just like you, I, too, became a prosecutor for a personal reason. Debeste: Huh...? I-Is that true...? B-But... you're a really successful prosecutor... I'm sure that Pops... the P.I.C. chairman... would have been more proud of you than me. Edgeworth: I see... so, you wanted your father's approval. Debeste: Ooh.....! I thought that if I became the best prosecutor, he'd be proud of me! That's why I...! I just wanted to help out Pops as much as I could......! Edgeworth: Would you... happen to be protecting your father? Debeste: Wha... I-I don't have any reason to protect someone like him...! Edgeworth: Didn't you want to help out your father... as much as you could? Debeste: Uuuuuunngh... Just once... I only wanted to be useful to Pops just this once! That way... I could help him regain his repetition! Edgeworth: You seem to be mixing up your words again... The word you're looking for is \"reputation\". Debeste: Huh? N-No one's ever told me that before! Edgeworth: Your father, who has strayed from his path, continues to add to his crimes... Even knowing that, do you truly want things to stay the way they are? Debeste: But... in that case, just what am I supposed to do? Edgeworth: You should triumph over your father, who has treated you like a fool. You must stop Blaise before he commits another crime! Debeste: ! I never thought of it that way. I... I want to triumph over Pops! Edgeworth: ...Somehow, it seems he has calmed down once again. Now's my chance to ask him about Blaise's secret! I will give Sebastian the courage to stand up to his father! Edgeworth: Hmm... He seems to have become unsettled again. I suppose I should lend him a hand... Edgeworth: The place you thought would be the safest... Would that have been in Blaise Debeste's hands? Debeste: Ungh... Waaaaaahhh! H-He told me that it would be safer if he took care of the evidence! Edgeworth: I'm sorry... but he has betrayed your trust in the worst way possible. Debeste: Pops... why would he want to hide the evidence...? Edgeworth: Blaise's objective was to have Warden Laguarde found not guilty, by obscuring the truth... Sebastian. You... were used by your father! Debeste: Ungh... Uwaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: It's possible that Blaise Debeste has the evidence with him. Furthermore, we still have no idea where Shaun is. I must return to my investigation posthaste, however... Debeste: This... This is all my fault...! What am I gonna do now...!? Edgeworth: ...Seeing him like this, I can't just leave him be. He is still suffering in the gap between his ideal and reality. He will never move on until he figures out how to live his own life! Sebastian is about to face his greatest trial. Perhaps this is fate. I shall give him the push forward that he needs. Edgeworth: For goodness' sake... Don't you remember your own words? Perhaps his \"own will\" can show him the way. Edgeworth: As a prosecutor... didn't you want to walk a different path from your father? Certainly, the path you have chosen is not an easy one. Nevertheless, you still chose to live as a prosecutor. In that case, it should be clear to you what you need to do...! Debeste: ! Edgeworth: ...I still question how I live my life to this day. But you, Sebastian... have found your own answer. So believe in yourself, Prosecutor Debeste! Debeste: I... WAAAAAAAAAAH! Edgeworth: (He was mistaken for Shaun, and kidnapped by Blaise's underlings. And after his father stole his evidence, he lost his confidence as a prosecutor... The emotions he is going through must be more painful than anything I could imagine.) It's taken longer than I thought... but with that, it's checkmate. Debeste: U-unh, uugh... ungh...! D... D-D-D-D... DARN IIIIIIIIIIIT! Edgeworth: .......... Kay: H-He dashed out of here at full speed... Edgeworth: (It seems if there's one thing he's \"the best\" at, it's running away...) Edgeworth: (Curses! We're running out of time...) We should check in with Mr. Shields. (I'd also like to know what the situation is like on their end.) Kay: But Mr. Debeste ran off again... Edgeworth: We'll just give them the new information we discovered. Franziska will take his place. Kay: Hmm... I wonder if that's going to be enough... Edgeworth: It can't be helped. Since he ran away, there's nothing more we can do. District Court - Courtroom No. 3 Ray: Eerm. I guess I'll just say it again. If there's no murder weapon, you can't prove the defendant is guilty. Franziska: Franziska: Just because we don't have the murder weapon, doesn't mean the defendant is innocent! It seems you wish to taste the sting of my whip. Ray: Gyaaah! Laguarde: Mr. Attorney. This trial... How much longer will it take? Because it feels like it hasn't gone anywhere at all for a good while now! Ray: Well, sorry, but that stubborn prosecutor over there just doesn't seem to understand. Franziska: Until I am satisfied... ...this whip will lash out at you as many times as I see fit. Ray: (By now, she's probably whipped me once for every year I've been alive... Miles... What's taking you so long? Even though we're just stalling for time, Uncle Ray can't keep this up much longer!) Whoops, 'scuse me. Phone call. Mind if I take this? Gravelle: ...I will allow it. Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. Ray: Oh, Miles, it's you. How's it going over there? Edgeworth: We found Sebastian. Ray: Oh! And the knife and chisel? Edgeworth: It seems he handed the evidence over to Blaise Debeste. It's very likely that Blaise knows the whereabouts of the murder weapon. Ray: Ex-chairman Debeste!? But, why would Blaise...? Edgeworth: That, I don't know yet. However, there may be some hidden connection between... ...Fifi Laguarde and Blaise. Ray: Gotcha. In that case, I'll issue a subpoena for Blaise Debeste right away. Edgeworth: ! Ray: I'll grill him personally. Edgeworth: I will continue to search for the missing evidence. (And for Shaun, as well...) Ray: Try to hurry it up, would ya? We're at our wits end over here! It feels like the verdict could be handed down at any moment! Edgeworth: Understood. (How much longer can Judge Gravelle's heart hold out? I know she's in a lot of pain... I've got to hurry.) Outside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza Kay: So? How's the trial going? Edgeworth: Blaise will be taking the stand. I don't know how things will turn out, though. Kay: He'll do anything, from hiding evidence to kidnapping... He really is nothing but trouble. Edgeworth: I agree. We should probably take another look at the evidence concerning him. Kay: OK! Leave it to me! First, here's the latest evidence fresh from the scene! Edgeworth: They're... the gloves from earlier. Although I am certainly curious about them... Anything else? Kay: The case files from the IS-7 Incident. If I recall, Blaise was also involved in this, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. He was involved in destroying the evidence. For now, let's keep this on hand. IS-7 Incident Documents jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Now then... is there anything else? Kay: Of course! Last but not least... We've got this! Edgeworth: This is... the Yatagarasu's badge. ...Kay. I'm talking about things related to Blaise. Please be serious. Kay: But aren't you always going around presenting random evidence too, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Gah...! No... W-Well... That's... Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?) Kay: Ah! What're you doing here? Debeste: WHOOOOOOOAAAHH! Kay: H-He ignored us... Edgeworth: (He came out of the Grand Tower... What was he doing in there?) Kay: Let's go investigate what Mr. Debeste was up to! Edgeworth: Yes... Let us go. Grand Tower - Rooftop Edgeworth: Hm? (The hatch is open...) Kay: It might be Mr. Debeste who opened it! Grand Tower - 51st Floor Storeroom Edgeworth: (Did Sebastian come in here...?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Over there! The safe's open! Edgeworth: (Did he come here to open that? ...Let's examine it thoroughly.) Kay: There's something inside the safe! Edgeworth: Let's go ahead and have a look. There are some documents in here... Kay: Hmm... it's just a bunch of papers and... huh? There's a photo here too. Edgeworth: Hm? This is a picture of...! Kay: Huh!? Th-That's Mr. Knightley! Knightley: ...Horace Knightley. The president's bodyguard. Kay: Why is his picture here? And what are all of these papers for!? Edgeworth: I don't know... We will have to read the documents to find out. I'm all but certain there is a connection between Knightley and Kanis. Kanis's chess partner, whose identity remained unknown until now... ...was actually Knightley all along. That is proof enough. Tomorrow, I shall interrogate him in the warden's office. I'll get him to confess that he's one of Kanis's henchmen. That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago... ...you simply must retrieve it. Edgeworth: This... seems to be a report about Knightley. Kay: Not to mention, it was apparently written before Knightley was killed...! Edgeworth: (Horace Knightley was murdered while he was being interrogated in the warden's office...) Judging from the contents, this document was probably written by Fifi Laguarde. Kay: I knew it! Edgeworth: The question, however, is who this report was addressed to. Kay: Ah! The owner of this safe is...! Edgeworth: The Conductor... Blaise Debeste. Kay: So, this proves that Ms. Laguarde and Blaise are connected! Edgeworth: Indeed. However, it's not just the two of them. Kay: Huh? Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste and Fifi Laguarde were searching for Kanis's henchmen. Kay: Bodhidharma Kanis! That dog-loving assassin! Edgeworth: This means that there is a hidden connection between the three of them. Kay: I wonder what it could be? Edgeworth: I don't know, but it must be related to this case. Report on Knightley jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Ah! There's some other stuff in here that I remember seeing! Edgeworth: Hm? There's something on his finger. Kay: Let's have a closer look! Oh! It looks like an expensive ring! Edgeworth: Don't steal it. Kay: Wha...! I didn't do anything yet! Edgeworth: It's Horace Knightley's... The chessboard and the ring... All of his possessions are inside this safe. Kay: So basically, all of this stuff is evidence from the prison case? Edgeworth: Correct. Kay: Then, the knife and chisel that vanished might be in here too! Let's see. Mr. Knife... Mr. Chisel... Hmm. They're not in there... I guess this is all just Mr. Knightley's stuff. Edgeworth: I see... That's too bad. (Horace Knightley... is dead.) Knightley: EEEEEDGEWOOOOOORTH!!! This game isn't over yet! You hear me! I...! I...! Edgeworth: (However, the game is not over yet... ...unless I can see it through to its end!) Knightley's Mementos data jotted down in my Organizer. Grand Tower - Rooftop ???: Young lady, good sir. ...Might I interest you in some cotton candy? Edgeworth: Hm? ???: There is also ice cream, if that is what you'd prefer? Edgeworth: Y-You! Sh-Shelly de Killer! de Killer: It's good to see you are well, Mr. Edgeworth. Kay: Wh-What are you doing in a place like this!? de Killer: As you can see, I am selling cotton candy. Would you care for some \"Heavenly Cotton Candy\"? Even sweeter than death. One bite will send you straight to heaven. Edgeworth: (That's definitely not something I'd want to buy from De Killer.) de Killer: The meaning of my message... Have you understood it? de Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Edgeworth: Have you been spying on us this whole time? de Killer: Spying? Heavens no. I was simply watching over you... ...while disguised as a cotton candy salesman. Edgeworth: (Isn't that the exact same thing!? What is this man's objective?) Were you the one... who murdered the president? de Killer: No. The contact with my client has already expired. ...President Huang is a bit of a celebrity in the world of assassins, you see. Over the years, many attempts on his life were made, and yet, he stubbornly lives on. He is a robust man, surrounded by flawless security. He even employs body doubles. Edgeworth: (Robust... That president? Rotund seems more apt.) ...However, it seems this time the president's security wasn't exactly flawless. Kay: Mr. Rooke had only just prevented your previous assassination, but this time...! de Killer: I did not kill him. It is not my principle to kill needlessly. I am also grateful to Rooke, a worthy adversary who was connected to me by fate. Thanks to that man, I did not kill a target who had no value to be killed. Edgeworth: (\"Thanks\" to Rooke preventing the assassination... What does he mean?) de Killer: My client deliberately gave me a false target. ...It was a betrayal most foul. I am now searching for my client. In all likelihood... ...it is the same person you are looking for. Edgeworth: (Is he saying that his client murdered the president?) Just who is this person you are referring to...? de Killer: I, myself, am not allowed to say. It would be a violation of the rules. I cannot disclose the identity of my clients. For to do so would create a problem of trust with my other clients. This is precisely why I am personally searching for them myself. Kay: What are you going to do when you find your client? de Killer: Of course... they shall be rewarded with a punishment most befitting of a traitor. Kay: Whaaaa!? That person... Wh-What'll happen to them? de Killer: ...I will leave that up to your imagination. Edgeworth: (It certainly won't be anything pleasant...) de Killer: Oh, yes... I will tell you just one more thing. Three days ago, Bodhidharma Kanis escaped from prison. Edgeworth: What!? de Killer: Three nights past, Kanis's solitary cell was found vacant. It was almost as if he knew I would come pay a visit. Edgeworth: (He visited Kanis's cell? Could it be, that the person De Killer is searching for is...) de Killer: Well then, if you'll excuse me, I must get going. Let us both do our best in tracking down that person... Edgeworth: (So, De Killer and Kanis. These two assassins...) Outside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza Edgeworth: (Hmm. This sound is...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Judge Gravelle's cellphone is ringing! Edgeworth: (Could it be Shaun?) ???: Mr. Edgeworth. How are you doing? Edgeworth: (It sounds like they're using a voice changer...) Who is this? ???: Someone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood... Edgeworth: (The red hood?) ...Are you the person who ambushed Kay? ???: Brilliant deduction! I'd expect no less from a prodigy prosecutor such as yourself! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I wanna listen in on this too! Edgeworth: Very well. (I'll put it on speaker...) ???: Well, I must say that I didn't expect the girl to get amnesia. Kay: Hey! What's that supposed to mean!? ???: But that's not all, y'see. Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane. Edgeworth: What!? (This must be the person De Killer spoke of...!) ???: I really should thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: You have no reason to thank me! ???: Oh, you haven't noticed? My, that's troublesome, y'know. I wanted you to catch Blaise for me... ...so I took dear little Kay. Edgeworth: What? ???: If Kay was suspected, I knew you would investigate the case. And I was sure that the great Miles Edgeworth would be able to catch Blaise! It was according to my plan! And y'know, I get the feeling that you have the wrong idea, so let me clear something up. Blaise Debeste wasn't the one who kidnapped Ms. Gravelle's son. Edgeworth: ! You... Why do you know about the kidnapping? ???: You and Ms. Gravelle are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you... Edgeworth: (How could this person know something like that...? Judge Gravelle was supposed to have visited me using the detective's name...) ???: I bet you're wondering how I knew about the kidnapping, right? It's quite simple, really! It's because darling little Shaun is in my care right now. Edgeworth: What!? Kay: Huh!? ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Quickly, little Kay! You have to hurry and steal him back! You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you? Kay: You even know it's my first job!? Edgeworth: (Why does this person know everything in so much detail?) ???: Well... I suppose I can't blame you for your mistake. It seems Blaise was after Shaun as well, y'see. Edgeworth: (So there were two kidnappings...) ???: He's such a fool, y'know. Kidnapping his own son instead! Edgeworth: Is Shaun there with you? If he is, then I would like to hear his voice. ???: Hmm. He's here, but I'm afraid I can't do that. Y'see, he's asleep right now. Edgeworth: In that case, there's no way for us to know if you really kidnapped Shaun or not. ???: ...Hmph. I suppose you don't have to believe me if you don't want to. Edgeworth: What is your objective? Is it to get Fifi Laguarde declared not guilty? ???: A not guilty verdict, eh... I couldn't care less about that. Edgeworth: (So his objective is different from Blaise's?) ???: ...I think I'll keep my objective a secret for now. Well then, I must be going. I hope you enjoy yourself, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Don't think you can get away with this. ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: Ngh...! Kay: Who in the world was that...? Edgeworth: I don't know. We don't have enough information. Kay: Darn it! We're totally clueless! Meanwhile, they seem to know everything about us! Edgeworth: ! (Know everything about us...?) Kay, you're right. Thinking about it, it is strange. How does the culprit know so much about us? Kay: It's so weird! I mean they even know about the kidnapping! Edgeworth: We must figure out how the culprit was able to obtain that information. (I must recall... What exactly did that person know?) ???: You and Ms. Gravelle are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you... ???: You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you? Kay: You even know it's my first job!? ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Edgeworth: (That's it! By analyzing our conversation with the culprit...!) I've figured it out, Kay. I know the source of this person's information! Kay: What!? Really!? Edgeworth: In all likelihood, this person probably... Edgeworth: I believe it is highly likely that we have been bugged. Kay: B-Bugged!? Edgeworth: If you recall what that person said... ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Edgeworth: If they couldn't see our faces, that means they weren't talking our pictures or following us. Kay: Th-Then, they must've planted a bug somewhere! Could it be in my stuff...? Edgeworth: (Was there anything they could have had a chance to bug...? There must be a hint somewhere in our conversation just now... That's right... that person knew something they shouldn't have. The conversation between Judge Gravelle and myself in the visitor's room...) Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! Gravelle: Hush. Please, have a seat. Edgeworth: (The only evidence I had with me at the time was...!) Where was the bug planted...? Edgeworth: Kay. May I see your badge? Kay: My Yatagarasu's badge? No way! Edgeworth: Wh-Why not...? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, just because you became a Great Thief's assistant... ...doesn't mean you're ready to wear this badge yet! Edgeworth: That's not it! It's very likely that a bug was planted in it. Kay: Whaaat!? In my badge? Edgeworth: Let's take a closer look. Kay: Ah! This is...! Edgeworth: It seems I was right. Yatagarasu's Badge data updated in my Organizer. Kay: How did you know? Edgeworth: The person had been in contact with you. Kay: You mean, when I was knocked unconscious. Edgeworth: Yes. That's why I thought one of your possessions might have been bugged. However, that person also overheard my conversation with Judge Gravelle. Even though that conversation took place in the visitor's room with just the two of us... Kay: Ah, so you were holding onto it at that time... Edgeworth: Exactly. All the other evidence had been taken away from me... Only the Yatagarasu's badge remained with me. Kay: So this creep's been listening in on us the whole time! Edgeworth: Indeed. That must be how they knew about all the information we collected. Kay: Does that mean... they're also listening in on this conversation? Edgeworth: Most likely. Kay: Hey, buster! Edgeworth: K-Kay... Kay: Eavesdropping is for cowards! Why don't you come out here and fight us fair and square!? Edgeworth: (Hm? What was that sound just now?) Nicole: Owwwwwwww... Kay: Huh? That's... Nicole! Nicole: Honestly, y'all scared the bejeezus out of me! Your voice was so loud there, Lil' Missy... I was so surprised I done fell flat on my behind! Kay: I-I'm sorry...! Nicole: What were ya gettin' so riled up for? Kay: You gotta hear this! It really grinds my gears! Nicole: Yes, yes? Edgeworth: ...Kay. Please just leave it at that. Unless you want to make tomorrow morning's headlines. Kay: Ah! That was close... Nicole: Aww, shucks. Don't be such a stick in the mud... What's wrong with lettin' a gal open her heart and spill the beans? Edgeworth: (For now, I'll turn the bug off.) Bug data jotted down in my Organizer. Nicole: So... did ya find the kidnappers? Edgeworth: Ms. Swift. Was the boy you saw being kidnapped... ...this boy in the photo? Nicole: Hmm? Nope, they ain't nothin' alike. He had a more stupid-lookin' face, and was wearin' a collared school uniform... Kay: I thought so... Edgeworth: (Yet again, we were led astray by this woman's testimony...) We will have to conduct our investigation all over again. So, we're back where we started. Are there any new leads...? (There's only 20 minutes left until 2 o'clock! Will we be able to make it in time...?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Mr. Edgeworth! About that phone call just now... Wasn't there a strange sound at the end? Edgeworth: A strange sound...? Edgeworth: Don't think you can get away with this. ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: Now that you mention it... It sounded like an explosion (Sound of an explosion - Sound of an explosion was heard during the call from the kidnapper.). It might be a hint to establish the culprit's whereabouts... Nicole: Mm-hmm. I see, I see. The sound of an explosion, eh? Edgeworth: Hmph! I would appreciate it if you stopped eavesdropping on us! Nicole: Mr. Prosecutor... Yer as stingy as ever. Edgeworth: (...First, let's see what she has to say...) (Clearing all \"Talk\" options of Nicole leads to:) Nicole's Tape Recorder data jotted down in my Organizer. ???: Mr. Edgewooooorth! Edgeworth: Mr. Saint, Ms. Berry! Simeon: D-Did you find him? Kay: Not yet. Just where could Shaun be...? Simeon: Shaun? Kay: Ah! No, no! It's nothing! Don't worry about it. Edgeworth: (They don't know anything about the kidnapping.) Regarding Sebastian, we found him not too long ago. Simeon: Really!? That's great! Thank you so much! Now I won't be arrested again. Edgeworth: Based on the explosion sound we heard from the kidnapper's phone... ...we know that Shaun is being confined some place in the vicinity of the Coliseum. Kay: One of the garbage dumps is right next to the Coliseum! Edgeworth: Shaun was almost certainly taken there. In which case... the place he is being confined to must also be somewhere close by. Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Could I ask you to search the area around this garbage dump? Gumshoe: .....You don't have to ask me like we're strangers, sir! It feels... so distant. ...Please just order me around like you normally do. Edgeworth: Are you sure, Detective? Right now I'm not a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Didn't I tell you, sir? Detectives don't just investigate for the sake of prosecutors! Edgeworth: ...You have my thanks, Detective. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth. Look. It's almost time...! Edgeworth: Yes. It would be best if we hurry. They should also be at their limit. Detective Gumshoe, I'm counting on you! Gumshoe: Leave it to me, sir! This may be an unofficial investigation... ...but I'll call in all of my pals from the station to help! Kay: I'll help too! Stealing Shaun back is my job, after all! Edgeworth: I'll be returning to the courtroom. I might be able to draw out some more time. Kay: Oookay! Well then! Even in the depths of... night... Edgeworth: Hmm. The clock just struck 2...! We have to hurry! Gumshoe: Yessir! Kay: Aaah, my introduction! ...When no other bird dares to take fliiight... Blaise: Well, well, well. If it isn't former Prosecutor Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Blaise Debeste...!) Franziska: Witness! Face forward! We're not done talking yet! Blaise: Like I said, y'see. Why exactly would I have needed to help that person out, Your Honor? Blaise: Y'know, it's a crying shame. Having a beautiful woman declared guilty. Honestly, it brings tears to my eyes. But y'see, there's no reason for me to go out of my way to hide evidence just to save her. Franziska: Franziska: However, we still have the testimony of your son, Prosecutor Debeste! He testified that he handed the evidence over to you! Blaise: Hmm. Well, I haven't the slightest clue what he was talking about. I simply can't imagine why Sebastian would have said something like that, y'know. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What if there is evidence that shows your connection with Warden Laguarde? Blaise: Hm? And just what do you think you're doing, \"Former\" Prosecutor Edgeworth? I was under the impression that you were no longer in any position to stand in court? Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! How dare you barge into my prosecutor's bench... Edgeworth: Franziska. I'm sorry. I need you to lend me the bench for a little while. Franziska: Wh-What are you saying...!? Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! I've brought vital evidence related to this case. Your Honor, please allow me to testify! Gravelle: ........ Blaise: Hah hah hah! She'd never allow it! Ray: Ray: Gravelle-pie. Uncle Ray also asks that he be allowed to testify. There are no objections from the prosecution either, right? Franziska: .......... Understood. The prosecution also has no objections. Blaise: Blaise: There's no way you can allow something like this, y'know. Such high-handed methods... ...surely are enough to warrant being held in contempt of court. Wouldn't y'say, Gravelle? Gravelle: ........ Edgeworth: (Ngh! As long as Shaun is still in danger... ...Judge Gravelle cannot rule against the warden. I must convey to her somehow that the search for her son is progressing!) Judge Gravelle. I ask that you have faith in me and my assistant. Franziska: Now that you mention it, where exactly is she...? Edgeworth: She is currently out searching for the most important piece of evidence. Blaise: Blaise: It's a waste of time. There's no such evidence. Are you stalling for time? How disgraceful. Ray: Ray: Most important piece of evidence, huh? ...Gravelle-pie. I don't really know what that evidence is, but I think we should have faith in her. After all, even if she may not look like it, she's still the Great Thief Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: (Somehow... it seems that Mr. Shields understands.) Judge Gravelle! We've already determined the general location of that evidence. It's only a matter of time before she steals the evidence back. Gravelle: ! ......I understand. Then I shall give you special permission to testify. Edgeworth: ...Thank you, Your Honor. Blaise: This is ridiculous! Gravelle: This vital evidence that you have found... Please present it to the court! Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste and Fifi Laguarde are somehow connected. Allow me to present the evidence that proves it! (Which piece of evidence shows the relationship between Fifi Laguarde and Blaise Debeste?) Edgeworth: This document contains a detailed report regarding the interrogation of a certain man. Ray: A certain man? Edgeworth: That man being the late Horace Knightley. And, the one who interrogated him was the defendant in this trial, Fifi Laguarde. Ray: ! So that means, that was the interrogation where... Edgeworth: That's right... Fifi Laguarde murdered Knightley in the aftermath of the interrogation. And that very interrogation has been recorded in this written report! Gravelle: That... definitely sounds like vital evidence! Franziska: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. Just now, you referred to that document as a \"written report\". Now, just who in the world was that report written for? Edgeworth: I thought you might ask that, Franziska. And that's precisely what is most important about this report...! We found this document inside the safe in the storeroom on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower. Franziska: The 51st floor... The storeroom for the black market auction! Edgeworth: Indeed. And the Conductor of the auction was you, Blaise Debeste! Blaise: ............ Edgeworth: You received a report about the victim from Warden Laguarde! In the face of this evidence, can you still say you have no connection to this case? Blaise: ......In regards to that, I refuse to answer. Edgeworth: What? Blaise: It has yet to be proven in court that I was the Conductor of the black market auction. Edgeworth: Oh? Have you already forgotten the events of this morning? I believe I had already proved it back then, did I not? Blaise: I will not deny that I was bested by you. However, that was at the crime scene. Who knows if the results will be the same in court. An acquittal is still possible, y'see. ...Until it's been proven in court that I am the Conductor of the black market auctions... ...you can't prove that document was addressed to me. Edgeworth: Your logic is twisted...! Blaise: That's not very nice, y'know. My logic isn't twisted, is it? Gravelle? Don't you feel the same way? It was quite unlike you to allow Former Prosecutor Edgeworth's statement just now, y'know. ...It saddens me, y'see. That you would fail to uphold the law as a judge should. In fact, I'm so upset by this, I may have no other choice but to use my last resort, y'know. Gravelle: .....I-It is as you say. Something that has not been proven in court does not merit any deliberation. I will have to... overrule... Mr. Edgeworth's claim. Edgeworth: (Ngh... As I thought, until Shaun has been rescued...) Blaise: Y'see? The truth at the scene and the truth in the courtroom are two very different things. Edgeworth: So, you're saying the truth can be distorted in court, as long as it's for your sake? Blaise: What a horrible thing to say. I'm not distorting the truth or anything like that, y'know. If a not guilty verdict is handed down, then that becomes the truth. That's all it is, y'see. Edgeworth: (It's useless. There's nothing we can do useless the missing evidence turns up...) Blaise: Now then, Gravelle. Why don't you deliver a Not Guilty verdict and let's get this over with? After all, that evidence... isn't gonna show up any time soon, y'know. ???: Gravelle: Wh-Who raised an objection just now? Debeste: ...P-Pops... Blaise: .....Sebastian. Debeste: ......Uugh. Blaise: Why did you come back here, now of all times? Gravelle: Sebastian! What is the meaning of this? Franziska: Just where were you and what have been doing since you abandoned your own trial? Debeste: I-I'm sorry. I was... umm... Franziska: Such an act is unbecoming of a prosecutor! You should be ashamed! Debeste: I... umm... well... Blaise: Sebastian. You still don't get it, y'know. This court has no place for sniveling child such as yourself! Debeste: .....Pops.....! I...... I...! I-I've come to present new evidence, Your Honor! So, so... please! Let me take my place back at the prosecutor's bench! Edgeworth: (Sebastian...! I didn't think he would come back...) Blaise: Blaise: Hah hah hah hah! What's all this now, Sebastian? You don't seem at all like your normal self! Debeste: ........Uugh. Pops... Blaise: Hm? Come now! What's the matter? You want Daddy to play with you? Is that it? Well then, why don't we just head on back home. Debeste: R-Return to the witness stand. Blaise: What's wrong? You're shaking like a leaf. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! The prosecutor officially in charge of this case has just arrived with new evidence. The trial is still in session. In light of this, shouldn't we continue with the proceedings? Gravelle: ........ Ray: Naturally, the defense has no objections, Your Honor. I'm sure the defense attorney originally in charge would say the same. Franziska: .....The prosecution has no objections, either, Your Honor. Gravelle: .......... Blaise: Continue with the proceedings? That won't be necessary. Isn't that right? Gravelle. Edgeworth: (Blaise still believes that he was the one who kidnapped Shaun. As long as Shaun still hasn't been found... ...Judge Gravelle will remain bound by Blaise, and nothing else will change that!) Gravelle: .......... Th-That sound is... Edgeworth: (Her cell phone...!) Hm...! (My phone as well...?) Ray: Eh? Uncle Ray's phone is also...! Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! Kay: Mr. Shields! Gumshoe: We've found Shaun, sir! Kay: We rescued Shaun! Edgeworth: Excellent work, Detective! Ray: That kid was the most important piece of evidence, right? Way to go, Kay! Kay: Eheheh! I wanted to spread the word quickly, so I had everyone call! Edgeworth: .....Judge Gravelle. It's for you. Gravelle: ..... Gravelle: .......Yes. I see. I'm..... I'm so glad you're safe...! Make sure you properly thank everyone. OK? ............Be careful, and come home safe. Gravelle: ...Let us resume the proceedings. Now that I may once again swing my gabel to my heart's content. Blaise: Hah...! You're kidding, right? This is just a sad joke, y'know! Gravelle: Witness! This is no joke! Please return to the stand! Prosecutor Debeste, as well. Promptly return to your seat at the prosecutor's bench! Debeste: Y-Yes, Your Honor! Franziska: ........Sebastian Debeste. Debeste: Y-Yes, Ms. von Karma...!? Franziska: .....I leave the rest to you. Debeste: Huh...? Franziska: \"Going up against your own father...\" It won't be easy. I shall observe how things pan out... from the gallery. Gravelle: Now then, allow me to ask once more... Is the prosecution ready? Prosecutor Debeste. What is this new evidence you wish to present...? Debeste: .....The missing knife and chisel, Your Honor. Ray: You mean they've finally been found!? Gravelle: Prosecutor Debeste! Is this true!? Debeste: ...Th-The knife and chisel... I wasn't able to find them... I searched and searched! I really did! But... it was already too late... Edgeworth: (Too late...?) Ray: What do you mean? Debeste: I remembered... This morning, when I passed by Pops in the garage at home... ...he was holding something wrapped in a newspaper. Debeste: Pops, where are you going? Blaise: Ah, Sebastian. Just taking out some trash. Debeste: At that moment, I heard it. .....The faint sound of a bell. Ray: Could that sound have been, by any chance... Edgeworth: ...the bell attached to Kanis's chisel!? Gravelle: In other words... you're saying that the witness threw away the evidence? Blaise: ........ Debeste: I searched for it, but I didn't make it in time. I'm sorry... Ray: Where exactly did you search for it? Debeste: The garbage dump! I went to the garbage dump and searched everywhere! I thought the evidence Pops threw away had to be there...! Edgeworth: Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?) Kay: Ah! What're you doing here? Debeste: WHOOOOOOOAAAHH! Kay: H-He ignored us... Edgeworth: (So at that time, he had gone to the garbage dump...) Debeste: But... but... ...this was all I could find. Gravelle: This is...? It smells rather peculiar... Ray: Now that you mention it, there's kind of a funky smell coming from you as well... Debeste: Wh-What do you expect!? I was digging through garbage! Edgeworth: And what of the knife? Debeste: I think it's buried somewhere in that giant mountain of trash... ...but I couldn't find it by myself. Gravelle: ...I understand. I shall accept this into evidence. Blaise: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Well done, Sebastian! You never betray my expectations, y'know! You searched so desperately through the garbage and that's all you have to show for it? Debeste: Urk...! Blaise: Awww, what a tear-jerker! I'm tearing up already! Ray: Ray: It's a bit too early for tears, don't you think? We haven't examined the evidence properly yet. Blaise: ...I think it's just a pointless waste of time, y'know. Ray: I'm counting on you. Sebastian, Miles. Show him that the truth can be exposed in court and take him down! Edgeworth: (Mr. Shields is backing us up. Now all we need is a breakthrough...!) Prosecutor Debeste. Let's take a closer look at the evidence. Debeste: R... Right! Edgeworth: Let's have a look inside. (It'd be great if we could find some kind of proof.) This is... the bell that was attached to Kanis's chisel... Are there any traces left behind on it? Debeste: .....Ack, it's no good. There's not even a single smudge on it... Gravelle: What did you find, Prosecutor Debeste!? Blaise: Did you even find anything? Debeste: D... Darn it... Blaise: Of course you'd find nothing. Something like that can't be called evidence, y'know. All it is, is trash. It may be sad, but that's the truth, y'see. Edgeworth: (Were Sebastian's efforts all for naught...?) Indeed, this bell does not seem to be valid evidence... (However...) Debeste: Mr. Edgeworth! Are you really giving up!? Blaise: Calm as always, Edgeworth. Quite unlike Sebastian here! Gravelle: ...Well then, is the prosecution finished with its argument? Debeste: Debeste: Verity, not yet! We're not through yet! There's still something we haven't examined! Blaise: You're still not giving up? Struggling in vain's not cute at all, y'know. Edgeworth: (It seems Sebastian hasn't given up yet either. I was just thinking the exact same thing. The last item remaining... Is it trash, or is it evidence...? If we don't examine it, we'll never find out... The item I'm thinking of is...) Debeste: We're still not done examining the newspaper that the bell was wrapped in! Edgeworth: (It seems that Sebastian has the same idea as I do.) Blaise: Wow, this is just wonderful, y'know. So wonderful, it's to cry for. Is it desperation, or simply reckless abandon? Are you really going to... pin all your hopes on a worthless scrap of newspaper? Edgeworth: Heh. We won't know for sure whether or not it's \"worthless\" until we examine it, will we? Sebastian. Let's examine it posthaste. Edgeworth: Is this... a handprint? Debeste: ! There's something greasy on here too... Is it oil? Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! We'd like to request a fingerprint analysis on this paper! Could you please summon someone from forensics? Gravelle: Your request is accepted. Contact the lab at once! Forensics: Reporting! These are definitely fingerprints! However... it's from a glove! Debeste: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? Blaise: Didn't I tell you? It's nothing but a worthless scrap of paper. Just thinking about it, y'know. When handling important evidence... ...what kind of idiot wouldn't use gloves!? Oh wait, wouldn't that be you? The idiot who doesn't know when to give up. Ray: ...That's pretty harsh, talking to your son like that. Blaise: What's wrong with calling an idiot an idiot? If you want to be The Best, you have to be heartless. I have no compassion worthless individuals, not even my own son! Debeste: Pops...! I.....! Blaise: Y'know, you've always called yourself a genius prosecutor, haven't you? Didn't I explain to you this morning why you were a genius up until now? That's right. It was all because of me. Because of my authority. You were always being protected. By people like Gravelle... and me. Debeste: ........Uuunghh. Blaise: Now, get that stinking face of yours out of my sight. Debeste: Stinking... Blaise: Y'know, now that I think about it, that stench might just suit you perfectly. Just keep it away from my nose, or my eyes will start watering. Debeste: Debeste: Wrong... You're wrong, Pops. Blaise: ...Sebastian? What are you talking about? Debeste: ...You're the one who stinks, Pops. It's you, not me! Blaise: What...? Debeste: ...You haven't noticed, have you? You smell, Pops. So much that you can't even hide it. Mr. Edgeworth... Try smelling the hand print on the newspaper. Edgeworth: The smell...? ...Hmm. It smells... like oil... Debeste: I know something that smells just like it... Edgeworth: (Come to think of it, back then...) Edgeworth: (It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.) Debeste: That's right... The smell proves it. It proves that the culprit who hid the evidence was...! It's no good... I guess I can't become the best after all. I'm too soft... I could never be so heartless... ...I just can't bring down my father with my own hands. Edgeworth: (Prosecutor Debeste...) ..........Summon... your courage. \"Become a different prosecutor from your father\"... Wasn't that what you decided? Debeste: ! Edgeworth: We are prosecutors. And as prosecutors, we stand in the courtroom. In that case, isn't it our duty to shed light on the truth? Debeste: ........ Edgeworth: Exposing crimes and bringing criminals to justice. Even if the criminal is your own father... ...that is your duty, as a prosecutor. Didn't I promise you? That if you have the courage to stand up... I will show you the way. And if you cannot do it alone, then we shall do it together... Debeste: ...Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Allow me to present the evidence that connects this hand print with my father! Edgeworth: This is the smell of motor oil. The kind used for maintaining motorcycles... Debeste: Both myself and Mr. Edgeworth have smelled this exact same smell before! Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste! It was in your garage! Blaise: ! Edgeworth: And wouldn't you say these fingerprints have a rather peculiar shape? The five letters that spell out D-E-A-T-H. It's exactly the same as your own gloves. Blaise: Blaise: Ha ha ha! You can buy gloves like that from anywhere! It doesn't prove a thing! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that really the case? Debeste: That's not the only thing that these two pieces of evidence have in common! Edgeworth: (The fingerprints on the newspaper that was used to wrap up the bell... ...and Blaise's mechanic's gloves...) This is the unmistakable similarity they both share! Edgeworth: If you examine the imprint left by the letter A, you'll see it's unmistakably from this glove. Blaise: Whaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: And that's not all... There is one more item we must take note of. Namely, these dirt stains. I suggest we do a comparative analysis of the dirt stains from the newspaper and the glove. If the contents match up... then it will prove to be decisive evidence. Gravelle: Bailiff! Please have these dirt samples sent to forensics for analysis immediately! Blaise: Gaaaaaaaarrgh! Edgewooorth! Sebastiaaaan! You lowly prosecutors! Do you have any idea who I am!? Debeste: Pops... you can't run away anymore. It's been proven in court that you concealed the evidence. And that you tried to cover for the defendant... Blaise: Y-You're saying that I'm... Guilty? That I'll be sent to prison...? Me, Blaise Debeste? A couple of snot-nosed punks are gonna make me disappear!? There must be some mistake! Debeste: Debeste: Be a man and admit your crimes! Blaise: Blaise: Do you really think you can survive if I'm not around? Debeste: I..... I'll be fine now. I thought I wanted to be the best prosecutor, so I could get your approval, Pops. But, when I was kidnapped by your men... and stuck in that dark room, I started thinking. \"I am... truly powerless.\" I despaired, and averted my eyes from the truth. But... ...at that moment, Mr. Edgeworth stepped in and showed me the way. And now, I am no longer just a child chasing after his father's approval! I've become capable... I can find evidence on my own now! Blaise: Wha... My men kidnapped you? Why were you...!? Debeste: Debeste: Pops, I'll show you the truth you never knew... through this trial. Blaise: Sebastiaaan! How dare you speak to me like that...! You should've just stayed as an idiot son! Debeste: You may have hated me to the very end, Pops... ...but I... I've always looked up to you. Thank you for everything up until now. .....And goodbye. Blaise: You... Since when did you... All you've ever been able to do was depend on me! SebaSTIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNN! Gravelle: It has been established that the evidence was concealed by Blaise Debeste himself. A judgment regarding his concealment of evidence shall be delivered at a separate trial. The missing chisel and knife still have yet to be found. However, once a search of the waste disposal site is underway, they will surely be discovered. Laguarde: ...The knife will be found? Wh-What will happen to me if it's found? Edgeworth: Heh. No need to worry. You'll simply receive the punishment you deserve for your crime. Laguarde: Grrrr! Punishment? For me!? Blaise, what in the world are you doing!? You! You... After all your boasting about being able to create your own truths and Not Guilty verdicts! That's why I contacted you immediately after the prison incident in the first place! And to make matters worse, you even kidnapped the wrong kid! I just can't believe this! You really, really, really are... completely useleeeeeessss! Edgeworth: ...That was certainly a violent outburst. But you heard her, Prosecutor Debeste. Debeste: Yeah. She got flustered and said a bunch of important stuff! ...Right? Edgeworth: Indeed... That's correct. (He still doesn't seem very sure of himself...) Gravelle: Very well. And with that, this court is adjourned. ???: Edgeworth: What? Franziska: Huh!? Gravelle: Wh-Who are you? Lang: Judge Gravelle. It's still too early for a happy ending. Lang Zi says: \"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case.\" Gravelle: And who... might you be? Lang: The name's Shi-Long Lang. I'm just a humble, lone investigator. Gravelle: Do you have some objection with this trial? Lang: Hah! Not a chance! The defendant there has a heart as black as a moonless night. Laguarde: Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...? Lang: You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree? Edgeworth: Agent Lang. What are you talking about? Lang: The SS-5 Incident from 12 years ago... It's a case I'll never forget. Edgeworth: (12 years ago...?) Lang: ......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa. Edgeworth: (12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?) Edgeworth: (Might it have something to do with Lang's father and President Huang?) Lang: Fifi Laguarde. And you, Blaise Debeste. Back then, the two of you killed off the Lang clan... Laguarde: Rrgh... Gravelle: Were you involved in the incident 12 years ago? Lang: That's right, I was. However... I'm not here to chase after ghosts of the past. I'm here for you, Verity Gravelle...! Gravelle: M... Me? Lang: You, and one other... Shaun: .......... Gravelle: Shaun! Lang: Ms. Gravelle! You're coming along too! As a suspect in the murder of the president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang! What evidence do you...!? Lang: Lang: Settle down, Mr. Prosecutor. The investigation has only just begun. We're going to inspect the crime scene with the suspects in attendance. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang... did he get his hands on some new pieces of evidence?) Lang: If you have any objections, then you can tag along as well. Edgeworth: ...I shall do just that. Shaun: ........ Edgeworth: (\"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case\"... There are still many mysteries yet unsolved surrounding the murder of the president... Namely, the true nature of the \"giant monster\", and...) ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: (The true identity of the person on the other end of the phone...) To be continued. \n-- Shaun's Rehearsal -- Shaun: I wasn't feeling too great during yesterday's shoot, so I made a few bloopers. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. You said you didn't feel well. Could you tell me more concretely what was wrong? Shaun: That doesn't matter! I just wasn't feeling well, alright!? Kay: You weren't feeling well... Maybe you drank too much milk? Shaun: Wha... How'd you...!? Ah, no, I mean, that's not it... Edgeworth: (So he didn't feel well because of his stomach...) Kay: When I was young, I was told that chewing milk makes it easier on your stomach, y'know? Shaun: Th-This conversation is over! Anyways, I made a few bloopers. Shaun: They're reshooting the scene today, so... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So they planned to reshoot the scene today. And you were practicing for that last night. Shaun: ...My mistakes caused a lot of trouble for the people around me. I'm a pro, so practicing that much more is natural. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He certainly does have an admirable sense of responsibility.) Penny: Shaun is incredibly dedicated to his craft. He didn't even make any major mistakes in those bloopers. But he said if it would make the movie just a tiny bit better... Shaun: Shut up! You don't need to go around blabbering about stupid stuff like that! Penny: Ah... I-I'm sorry. Edgeworth: (If only he was a little more cooperative, I'd have no complaints.) Shaun: Hmph... Anyway, that's what happened. Shaun: Well, I decided to rehearse a little on my own. That's all. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. About your testimony just now... Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Don't I always tell you!? If you're going to practice by yourself, you have to let me know beforehand! Shaun: I-I-I know! Edgeworth: (...My time to speak was completely stolen away from me.) I shall ask you once more. Shaun, about your testimony just now... Kay: But you know, Shaun, I think that's really great! Edgeworth: (Mmph... A-Again!?) Kay: I bet putting in an honest effort like that will make someone even more talented. You'll go from a little thief to a Middle Thief, and then someday you'll become a Great Thief! I'll be doing my best, so you do your best too! OK, Shaun? Edgeworth: ........Ahem. Now then, if I may? Shaun. Do you often rehearse in that way? (At last... At long last, I finally got to ask my question...!) Shaun: I do it all the time. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There are no mistakes in that testimony, correct? Shaun: O-Of course there's no mistakes! It was just a normal, peaceful night! Nothing out of the ordinary happened at all! Kay: A... A peaceful night!? How can you say that when an incident like this has occurred!? Edgeworth: Kay, he is still a child. Please don't get seriously angry. Present Moozilla's Head Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that? Shaun: ...! I don't know anything about it. Edgeworth: Is that true? Shaun: I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something? Edgeworth: (...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after Shaun had already gone back...) Shaun: If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We're not done talking yet! Shaun: What now? Edgeworth: The falling monster's head wasn't the only unusual thing that happened last night. And this is something you should be well aware of. What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling? Present Monster's Footprints or Shaun's Practice Video Edgeworth: Leads to: \"We have evidence right here.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. Take a look at this. Shaun: And what's that supposed to be? Edgeworth: Don't you understand? This shows what happened last night. Shaun: ...... Edgeworth: Hmph... Have I left you speechless? Shaun: ...You're so far off the mark that I have nothing to say. Edgeworth: Argh! (Was I really that far off...?) Kay: Let's review what happened here last night one more time! Edgeworth: Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer! Kay: Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night? Leads back to: \"What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling?\" Edgeworth: We have evidence right here. Shaun: Ah! Could that be...!? Edgeworth: That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance. Shaun: ........Ugh. Lang: What!? You're telling me you have video from last night!? Edgeworth: Exactly. And in this video... ...there is clearly something that is out of the ordinary. Lang: Th-This is... a monster's footprint...! Edgeworth: Would you say that monster's footprints are commonplace on a film set? Gravelle: Shaun... Why did you conceal this video from us? Shaun: ........No reason, really. Lang: Lang: Hey, pup! This is no joking matter! You had a reason to hide it, right? Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Answer him clearly! Shaun: But Mom..... Edgeworth: Well? Shaun: ...I didn't want anyone to see me rehearsing. Lang: ........ Kay: ........ Edgeworth: ........ In other words, you're embarrassed about others seeing you practice. Shaun: ...Yeah. Got a problem with that!? Lang: Lang: You're saying that's why you hid the evidence? Gravelle: Shaun! Shaun: Eep! ...Quit nagging me. You've already busted me, what more do you want? Yeah, the footprints were there, but I just practiced and headed home. Lotta: How come yer so calm after findin' those footprints!? It's a monster, ya know!? A real live monster! Shaun: ...I thought it was just a part of the set. Besides, there's lots of other weird stuff around here too. Nicole: He's suspicious, Chief! This kid's really suspicious! Lotta: Yer right! The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven! Shaun: ...Shut up. We're done talking! Lang: Leads to: \"Wait up...\" Present Monster's Footprints or Shaun's Practice Video Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? We have evidence right here. Shaun: Ah! Could that be...!? Edgeworth: That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance. Shaun: ........Ugh. Lang: What!?

The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven! Shaun: ...Shut up. We're done talking! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We're not done here yet! Shaun: What now? Edgeworth: The monster's footprints weren't the only unusual things that happened last night. Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night? Present Moozilla's Head Edgeworth: Leads to: \"A monster's head fell from the roof of that building.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This shows what happened here yesterday. Shaun: ...And just what exactly does it show? Edgeworth: You don't understand, do you? You are still a child, after all. Shaun: I don't need some guy who's less intelligent than a child telling me that. Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (It seems that wasn't it...) Kay: Let's review what happened here last night one more time! Edgeworth: Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer! Kay: Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night? Leads back to: \"Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night?\" Edgeworth: A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that? Shaun: ...! I don't know anything about it. Edgeworth: Is that true? Shaun: I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something? Edgeworth: (...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after Shaun had already gone back...) Shaun: If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking! Edgeworth: (It seems that Shaun doesn't really want to talk about last night. Could he be hiding something after all...?) Leads to: \"Wait up...\" Edgeworth: So there was nothing out of the ordinary...? Kay: He doesn't know anything at all about the incident. That's the impression I'm getting. But isn't there evidence that shows something did happen last night? Edgeworth: Yes... I don't have time to waste dealing with a child's lies. Let's present the contradiction. Lang: Wait up... Edgeworth: ? Agent Lang? Lang: Heh heh heh. It's as I thought. Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. This video backs up my logic. Kay: Huh!? Is there something in the video that's related to the case? Lang: Yeah... Take a good, hard look at the monster costume in the top-left. Kay: The Moozilla costume...? Lang: Try comparing it with the one over there right now. Kay: Hmm? It looks like it's just hanging there limply though. And the zipper on its back is zipped up tightly. Edgeworth: (Zipper on its back...?) Wha! (Th-This discrepancy is...!) Lang: Yeah. The difference is plain to see. In the video, the zipper is clearly open! That's right... Someone was inside. Kay: WHAAAAAAAT! Edgeworth: Mr. Powers! Is the costume's zipper usually...? Powers: It's always zipped up tightly when it's not in use... Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. Do you remember? My logic from before... Lang: Two nights ago, Gravelle pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body. Edgeworth: In here? Lang: Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Edgeworth: You're saying the body... was hidden inside the costume? Lang: Yeah, that's right! Judge Gravelle! Two nights ago, you pushed the president off the roof of the tower. You then hid the body inside the monster costume! Gravelle: I... I did no such thing! Lang: Lang: Say what you want, but you're the only one who could've done it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That should have already been proven impossible. The film lot was locked at the time! Judge Gravelle could not have entered this place! Lang: Lang: ...And what if there was an accomplice? Edgeworth: What? Lang: I'll tell you my reasoning, so listen up. -- Mother and Son Theory -- Lang: When the president was pushed off the roof, Shaun was waiting at the film lot. If Shaun was an accomplice, the problem with the locks would be resolved. The two of them then hid the president's body. Inside that monster costume over there... Edgeworth: You think this crime had such an elaborate plan? Lang: To take the life of a nation's president. An elaborate plan is to be expected, don't you think? Gravelle: Gravelle: Shaun would never... take part in such a crime! Lang: Lang: You're the one being suspected. Your words don't carry much weight! Edgeworth: I wouldn't think those two had sufficient motive for something like this, though? Lang: Well, maybe they had a motive that we didn't know about? You were the last one to meet with the president. And you're still keeping the details secret. Don't you think it's only natural that you're being suspected? Gravelle: ...... Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Is there no way for you to tell us your secret. Gravelle: M-My apologies. I just cannot, no matter what... However, when the time I can talk about it comes, I will surely let you know. So, if you could please... Lang: Believe you? Is that what you wanted to say? That's what all criminals say. And you, pup... If you've got an explanation, hurry up and spit it out. Shaun: Hmph. I didn't do nothing. ...That's all I'm saying. Lang: Both mother and son won't talk. You still gonna defend 'em like this? Edgeworth: It's true, Judge Gravelle's actions are a mystery... ...however, we still don't know whether or not that ties in with a motive for murder. Lang: Yeah, that's right. Their motive for murder can wait. For now, let's talk about the situation surrounding the crime. ...And the fact that these two are the only ones who could've done it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang. Don't tell me you're saying Shaun was an accomplice? Kay: Shaun still looks like a grade school kid, he's even got a kiddy backpack to boot! How could he be an accomplice...? There's just no way! Penny: Like I said, Shaun's already in middle school, and the backpack is a part of his costume... Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says! \"No matter how young the cub, never pity an ungrateful pup.\" He may be a little brat, but a villain deserves no mercy. Kay: Uuuh... So Mr. Lang Zi didn't make any allowances for age... Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. You're not just defending him 'cause he's a pup, are you? Edgeworth: Hmph. Of course, that was never my intention. I shall present suitable evidence in due course. Lang: Oh? I'm looking forward to it. My logic's just getting started. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How would that... resolve the problem!? Lang: I figured you'd ask that, Mr. Prosecutor. But y'know, it's actually quite simple. Listen up... First, that woman pushes the president off the roof. Kay: Hmm... she pushes him off. Lang: Then, that brat, who knew the combination for the lock, unlocks the film lot. Kay: I see... the combination unlocks the brat! Edgeworth: Kay, it's the opposite. Lang: ...That's all it takes. With this, the problem of the lock is solved. Your theory that she couldn't get in because she didn't know the combination no longer files! Edgeworth: (Hmm... Regarding the lock, that certainly is a plausible explanation...) Agent Lang. Thank you for your clear explanation. Please, continue with what you were saying before. Lang: Hmph. If you're gonna give up, you better do it now. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Supposing those two were accomplices... Why would they have needed to leave the body hanging there for an entire day!? Lang: Lang: Why don't you give it a rest, and take a good hard look at reality. Thanks to their trickery, our investigation has been confused up until now. Doesn't that about answer your question!? ...Got it? Those two hid the body. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In the video, we cannot see the inside of the costume. So can you really say for certain that the body was placed inside? Lang: ...Yeah, I'll give you that much. In that case, why don't we try examining it? The inside of that costume! There might be some traces left inside. Edgeworth: Mr. Powers, may we examine the inside of the costume? Powers: Sure. Go ahead. But it might be kinda stinky, since I sweat a lot in here... Edgeworth: This is... incredibly dirty. Powers: That's strange... We always make sure to clean it after using it, so that the sweat doesn't damage the costume. Lang: Lang: Isn't this just proof that someone besides you used this costume? I'd say that dirt from the body probably got into the costume. Kay: The president's body did fall on top of the monster's footprint. That must be where the dirt came from! Lang: ...Are you satisfied now? Add statement: \"There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, dirt got into the costume when the body was hidden inside. Wouldn't that mean... ...that the dirt was transferred from the body? Lang: Hah! Isn't that obvious? How else would you say it got there? Kay: ...There's dirt stuck everywhere inside the costume. It looks particularly bad around the chest area. Edgeworth: (Dirt around the chest...? We cannot overlook this fact.) Kay: Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense... Edgeworth: Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point. Kay: In that case, what should we do? Edgeworth: Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail. Let's draw out more information.-- Mother and Son Theory -- Lang: When the president was pushed off the roof, Shaun was waiting at the film lot. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang.

It looks particularly bad around the chest area. Edgeworth: (Dirt around the chest...? We cannot overlook this fact.) Present Crime Scene Notes Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it...\" Kay: Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense... Edgeworth: Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point. Kay: In that case, what should we do? Edgeworth: Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail. Let's draw out more information. Edgeworth: Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it... Is that really the case? Lang: You have a problem with that? Edgeworth: There is a fair amount of dirt inside the front of the costume. Kay: Yeah, that IS a lot of dirt... Edgeworth: However, I would like you to focus on the state the body is in. It's lying on top of the dirt, and yet there's no dirt on the front of the body. If the body really was inside the costume... ...then it's strange that the front of the body isn't stained with more dirt! Lang: Rrgh! Well then, how would you explain it? How did the dirt get inside the costume!? Edgeworth: (From the video footage, it's very likely that someone was inside the costume. But just who could it have been...?) Kay: Hmm... Where have I seen this? Edgeworth: What's the matter, Kay? Kay: I just feel like I remember seeing something that looked like this dirt somewhere before... ...but where was it? There were these bits of gray fragments mixed in with the dirt. Edgeworth: (Gray... fragments? There does seem to be something other than normal dirt mixed into it...) Kay: Something must've gotten stuck to it, and lots of it I might add. Hmm... Edgeworth: (Something got stuck to it? This may merit a closer look. Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?) Present Mechanic's Gloves Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is what you're thinking of, isn't it, Kay? Kay: Oh! Mr. Edgeworth, you sure are sharp! Edgeworth: Hmph... Naturally. Kay: ...But too bad! Not this time! Edgeworth: Argh! (You should have just said that in the first place!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, can't you remember? Dirt, dirt... Where else did we see this dirt? Edgeworth: (Dirt... Wasn't there a piece of evidence that had dirt on it?) Kay: It's on the tip of my brain, but I just can't quite place it. Where on earth have we seen dirt like this before? Leads back to: \"(Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?)\" Edgeworth: This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it. Lang: Huh? And what of it? Edgeworth: We found an item belonging to a certain man, that was covered in the same type of dirt. That is to say, these gloves. Lang: Those dirt stains... certainly look the same. But, tell me... Just what exactly is this grey substance!? Edgeworth: This grey substance is... Plastic Edgeworth: Yes, I believe it's plastic. Your thoughts? Lang: Lang: Hah! You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Prosecutor! Put more \"BANG!\" into your claims, like you usually do! Edgeworth: Ah... Hmm. Lang: As for my opinion on the matter... I'll tell you right now, that stuff is definitely not plastic! Edgeworth: Nngwaaah! (So that wasn't it...) Kay: Let's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it? Edgeworth: Right. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally. Leads back to: \"This grey substance is...\" Concrete Leads to: \"This grey substance must be fragments of concrete.\" Paint Edgeworth: No matter how you look at it, this must be paint! Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor! When did you become so scatterbrained!? No matter how you look at it, this doesn't look like paint! Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (I suppose not...) Kay: Let's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it? Edgeworth: Right. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally. Leads back to: \"This grey substance is...\" Edgeworth: This grey substance must be fragments of concrete. Kay: You mean... the stuff that was scattered around the monster's footprints? Edgeworth: Exactly. Meanwhile, who do these gloves, which are stained with the same kind of dirt, belong to? Kay: Oh, I remember! We found it at Blaise's place! Edgeworth: Earlier today, we went to Blaise's garage. There, we discovered these dirt-stained gloves. Come to think of it, there were also hammers, shovels, and other tools placed inside, as well. Why would mechanic's gloves, intended to be used on machines, be covered in dirt? If he broke the concrete with the hammer, and then dug into the soil with the shovel... ...then it's only natural for dirt like that to get on the gloves. Kay: Then, maybe...! Edgeworth: Yes. The true nature of the monster's footprints... has been made clear. It's possible that these footprints were dug up by Blaise Debeste himself. Lang: Lang: It's possible...? Hmph! It's possible, you say!? Please do enlighten me. 'Cuz I honestly have no clue! Why on earth would he do something like that? Edgeworth: (Why did he make the monster footprints? Thinking about it, the answer must be...) He was digging something up Edgeworth: It's possible he was digging something up. Leads to: \"It probably went something like this.\" He buried something Edgeworth: Could it have been because he buried something? Kay: He buried something!? I smell treasure! So, what did he bury? Edgeworth: If we want to find that out, we'll have to dig it up ourselves. Lang: Lang: You think the police wouldn't have already investigated that? There was absolutely nothing buried beneath those footprints! Edgeworth: Nngwaaah! (It seems that was wrong...) In that case, we should assume the opposite: he dug something up. Leads to: \"It probably went something like this.\" Edgeworth: It probably went something like this. Last night at this spot, there was something that Blaise needed to dig up. For that reason, he broke the lock on the back door ans sneaked into the film lot... Using the hammer and shovel, he set to work. He placed the items he dug up into his bag, but before he could fill in the holes... Kay: Ah! That's when Shaun came to practice! Edgeworth: Exactly. Blaise panicked, and had no choice but to hide himself in the Moozilla costume nearby. Lang: Grr... To think you would deduce so much from just a pair of dirt-stained gloves... However! All of this is merely a possibility! There's still no proof that he was the one who was hiding inside that costume! For all we know, he might've left the scene once he finished digging! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: On the contrary. Such proof does exist, and can be seen... in the video. When this video was recorded, Blaise was definitely inside the film lot. Lang: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (Though I can't blame Agent Lang for not noticing... ...the difference between the current flim lot... ...and the one in Shaun's video. Along with the state of Blaise's garage... ...it's all too clear that Blaise was still here!) What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded? Present duffel bag beside monster costume Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This bag placed near the costume...\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This proves that Blaise was still at the film lot! Kay: Umm... How exactly does it prove that? Lang: Yeah, I'd like a better explanation as well! Edgeworth: ...Argh! (So this has nothing to do with Blaise...) Kay: If something belonging to Blaise could be seen in this video, then proving it would be easy... Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything that comes to mind? Edgeworth: (Something belonging to Blaise... Does anything like that appear in the video?) Lang: Well, Mr. Prosecutor!? How about it...? Is there really any evidence that Blaise Debeste was there? Edgeworth: There's no need to rush, Agent Lang. Leads back to: \"What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded?\" Edgeworth: This bag placed near the costume... There was an identical one inside Blaise's garage. Lang: ! Edgeworth: First, the dirt on the gloves, and now the bag... It seems there is a connection. Mechanic's Gloves data updated in my Organizer. Edgeworth: And that's my proof. Blaise was inside the costume. Ergo, the president's body could not have been hidden inside it! Lang: Aiyaaaaaaaaa! Edgeworth: (It seems I was able to refute Agent Lang's reasoning.) Gumshoe: Someone needs to go investigate Blaise's house right away, pal! We need to know what was inside that bag! Officer: Yessir! Lotta: Y'all pipe down and listen up! Y'all just been sayin' whatever works best for y'all! Edgeworth: (...And the noisy one returns.) Lotta: That there's the footprints of the Mighty Moozilla! They ain't just some random holes dug up by that old coot! Edgeworth: Hmph. I believe the true nature of these footprints has already been proven quite logically. Lotta: Logic schmogic, I ain't buyin' it! Say whatcha want, but I know what I saw, and I saw Moozilla! Edgeworth: (Is she referring to how she saw Moozilla out of the window of the Grand Tower...? Preposterous.) Nicole: Upon our journalist's souls, we ain't havin' none of it! Edgeworth: (That statement is an insult to journalists everywhere...) Nicole: Ah! That's right! There's more to them monsters than just those footprints! I remember hearin' that sonny over there was seen with the monster earlier! I reckon that gal over there said she witnessed it herself! Edgeworth: (When these two are together, all meaningful talk grinds to a halt...) Kay: If we only knew just what the \"monster\" really was, I think those two would quiet down. Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything you can do? Edgeworth: (The monster's true identity...?) We don't have much choice... Let's see what we can do. Lotta: Isn't there somethin' y'all ain't tellin' us about the monster!? Nicole! Ask 'em! Ask 'em right now! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ....Please settle down. Regarding the true identity of that \"monster\", I already know what it is. Lotta: Wha'd ya say!? Edgeworth: That's right. The video Shaun recorded provided the hint that I needed... Lotta: Whatchu talkin' bout? Edgeworth: (Ms. Nichols saw Gourdy... ...when she went to check up on Shaun's practice. At that times, she mistook \"something\" for Gourdy.) The \"monster\" can be seen in this photograph. Lotta: What!? Ain't that just some plain old souvenir photo!? Y'all don't really think ya can pull the wool over the eyes of a pro like me, do ya? Edgeworth: (What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?) Present camera crane Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was...\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The \"Gourdy\" that Ms. Nichols saw... was actually this! Lotta: There ain't no foolin' a real pro! Yer sayin' this is Gourdy!? It don't look nothin' like it! Edgeworth: Argh! (I had my suspicions...) Kay: Let's double-check what Gourdy looks like. Something with a similar shape might be in the photo! Edgeworth: Indeed. (Gourdy's shape...?) Leads back to: \"(What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?)\" Edgeworth: Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was... ...this camera crane! Lotta: Wh-What!? Edgeworth: The video Shaun recorded was shot from fairly high up. A shot from this position would be impossible without a camera crane. Nicole: But...! There ain't no way Ms. Nichols would mistake a camera crane for Gourdy! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I wonder about that. ...Ms. Nichols. Penny: Y-Yes! Edgeworth: Earlier, you said the prescription for your glasses didn't match your eyesight anymore, correct? Penny: Yes. Lately, it seems like my eyesight has suddenly gotten a lot worse. Edgeworth: So would you say that you weren't able to see Gourdy very clearly in the dark? Penny: That's right... Its silhouette was all I could make out... Nicole: But, remember what Ms. Nichols said!? And I quote, \"Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile...\"! Lotta: Camera cranes ain't got no flesh on 'em, let alone skin! It's just a bare steel frame! Edgeworth: That is certainly true. At least, in the case of this photo... However, last night it did have skin. Lotta: Y'all just doin' whatever ya can to get in the way of our big scoop, ain't ya!? Edgeworth: (That was not my intention... ...but since I've come this far, it's time to put an end to your nonsense.) Gourdy's skin is right before our very eyes. This is the \"skin\" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw! Present vinyl sheets Edgeworth: Leads to: \"As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night.\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is the true identity of Gourdy's skin! Lotta: And just how could somethin' like that be taken for skin, ya heinous prosecutor!? Yer just spoutin' nonsense, tryin' to take our whole scoop for yerself! Yer pure evil! Yer a demon prosecutor! Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (That is decidedly not what I'm trying to do.) On its own, the crane bears no resemblance to Gourdy at all. Kay: Something must have been draped over the crane. Edgeworth: (Last night, it looked like it was going to rain... And if that's the case, there's only one thing it could have been!) Leads back to: \"This is the \"skin\" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw!\" Edgeworth: As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night. While it never actually rained... ...Shaun still covered the camera crane with a rainproof sheet. Which, to Ms. Nichols... looked like a monster's skin! Nicole: Whaaaaaaaat! Lotta: Y-Ya gotta be kiddin' meeee! Edgeworth: Isn't that right, Shaun? Shaun: Man, you saw through it all. .....Not bad, old man. Edgeworth: Unfortunately, the \"Gourdy\" that Ms. Nichols saw was nothing more than an illusion. Lotta: Not again... Looks like my dream has shriveled up and died once again... Nicole: M-Mentor! Kay: Seems like things have finally settled down. Lotta: I really thought the boy was hidin' somethin' from me... Guess I had it all wrong. Lang: ...Now that we've figured out the true form of the monster, everyone seems refreshed. Kay: Actually, there's two people here who are totally bummed out. Forensics: Agent Lang! The report is in, sir! We've got the results of President Huang's autopsy! Lang: Good! Show it to me! Lang: \"Contusions and bone fractures found across the body, resulting from tremendous pressure.\" So, this was the cause of death. In other words... he was crushed to death. Edgeworth: (I thought as much...) Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer. Lang: The yellow stain on his chest is currently under investigation... ...but it seems that gunpowder residue was found on his right hand. Kay: Sunflower residue!? I didn't know the president was into gardening! Edgeworth: No, gunpowder residue. Traces of it are left behind when a gun is fired. Since it has been found on his right hand, it's possible that the president fired a gun. Kay: A gun, huh? But we didn't find any guns when we investigated this area. Edgeworth: (...Unexplained gunpowder residue? I'll have to look over the autopsy report later.) Now then, Agent Lang. It seems we have our answer. The president did not die from falling off the roof of the Grand Tower. Rather, he died from being crushed under Moozilla's head! Lang: I can't deny it... Looks like your logic was right after all. Kay: This means the suspicions surrounding Ms. Gravelle should be cleared up, right!? Edgeworth: Yes... Not only the cause of death, but the time of death proves her innocence as well. Judge Gravelle met with the president two nights ago. However, according to the autopsy report, the time of death was around 11 PM last night. Moozilla's head also fell last night... It matches up perfectly. Kay: That's a relief! Lang: Lang: ...Isn't it a bit too early to be relieved? Edgeworth: (Agent Lang?) Lang: The president died after being crushed by the Moozilla's head. That, I will admit. But the problem is, who was responsible for the falling head...? Edgeworth: Moozilla's head fell last night. And last night, the one who was at the film lot was... Gravelle: Gravelle: What are you saying!? Surely, you're not implying... Lang: That's right. You killed him, didn't you? Shaun Fenn! Shaun: ........ Lang: That pup is hiding something. He was at the scene where the body was discovered last night. He also saw the \"footprints\". And despite that, he still claims to know absolutely nothing about the incident? Isn't that a bit too convenient? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: These footprint-shaped holes have not been proven to be related to the case! Just because he saw the holes, doesn't necessarily mean that he's involved in the incident! Lang: Lang: You sure about that? Take a look at the pup's face. Shaun: .............. Lang: He looks pretty shaken up to me. Edgeworth: (It looks like he hit the mark... but Shaun doesn't want to talk about it.) Lang: If he doesn't feel like talking, then I have an idea of my own. Let's check the tape. Edgeworth: Agent Lang. What is your intention? Lang: The police have a device that lets you analyze the video footage up close and personal. Gravelle: Agent Lang. You would suspect Shaun enough to go that far... Edgeworth: (As long as Shaun's lips are sealed... ...this may be the only way for us to get closer to the truth.) Detective Gumshoe! If I'm not mistaken you have that device with you, correct? Gumshoe: Mr. Analysis is ready to go, sir! Lang: Now we're talking! Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth. Would you please perform the video analysis for us? Edgeworth: (She wants me to do it...?) Gravelle: Who knows what kind of faults that wolf-man will find in it! Edgeworth: (This isn't exactly my strong suit, but I suppose I have no choice... Are there any new clues shown on the video?) Monster costume Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It's the Moozilla costume. If you zoom in, you can see that the back is unzipped. Kay: Yeah. Mr. Powers was supposed to get inside to play the monster in the movie. ...But, I don't really get it. The Mozilla in the movie is supposed to be big enough to demolish an entire building. Once he's inside the costume, how does he activate its megazord form? Edgeworth: ...I think you have a big misunderstanding. The costume doesn't actually become big. Kay: I see. So what's big is not the costume, but the misunderstanding. Hmm... I think I kinda get it now. Thanks! Edgeworth: (Does she really understand...?) Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Dirt ground Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Blaised Debeste used the tools in his garage to dig up something. Kay: There was a huge hammer in his garage too. Edgeworth: Indeed. That was probably used to break the concrete. As it turns out, these weren't Moozilla's footprints at all. Are you disappointed? Kay: A Great Thief needs to have the strength to accept the truth, no matter how hard it is. I must become stronger. Much, much stronger! Edgeworth: (...I guess she couldn't handle the truth.) Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Di-Jun Huang (after zooming) Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(Th-This is...!)\" Anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's nothing of interest here. Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Edgeworth: (Th-This is...!) Kay: What's the matter? I wanna see too! ...Hm? Eeeeeeeeeek! Lang: Hey! What's wrong!? Show it to me! Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth! I request you submit the evidence to the court! Edgeworth: ...Please take a look at the top right corner of the zoomed-in video. Lang: Th-This... This person is...! ...th-the presideeeeeent! Gravelle: Impossible! Shaun: Huh!? N-No way! Lang: It seems we've finally found it at last. The evidence that points to the true killer...! Edgeworth: (This video places Shaun at a major disadvantage...!) Shaun: Y-You're wrong! That's not right! I didn't know anything about this! Lang: That's not gonna cut it. It's clear that you and the victim were together at the same place where his body was later found! Shaun Fenn! There's no doubt. You killed the president! Gravelle: N-No! This can't be...! Why, why would you...? Shaun... please don't tell me... Did you really kill the president? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Is this really decisive evidence...? Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. Looks like even you can't object to this. Edgeworth: (Ngh...!) Lang: That pup said he didn't know anything, right? And yet, the president's right here in the video! Shaun: ........ Edgeworth: Shaun! What are you hiding? Gravelle: Shaun...! Please tell us the truth! Shaun: .......... The truth is... The truth is... It's all my fault... Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! What did you do!? Shaun: M-M-Moozilla's head falling was all my fault! -- During the Rehearsal -- Shaun: While I was setting up the equipment on the roof, I used the heater... After that, I went down to practice, but I forgot to turn it off. Then my mom called me, so I left the film lot. When I came back to the lot, after the phone call was over... Moozilla's head that was on the roof had fallen... And right next to it was the president, lying dead on the ground... Gravelle: H-How can that be...? Edgeworth: I see. There were indeed traces that something had caught fire on the rooftop. Shaun: ..It was just a small fire, so I was able to put it out by myself. Kay: So... the president's death was Shaun's fault? Gumshoe: But, wouldn't that make this an accident, sir? Edgeworth: ...And then, what did you do with the fallen head? Shaun: I took it apart, brought the pieces up to the roof, and put it back together. Lang: Lang: So, you put out the fire, and even put the fallen head back on the roof. Which means you were hiding evidence... We can't be having that, you naughty little pup. Shaun: I didn't do it on purpose! I really did just forget to turn off the heater... Edgeworth: When the legs broke, the stand would have tilted. If Moozilla's head was on top of the stand... Kay: ...it would've fallen off! So, the head fell down because of the fire! Edgeworth: Yes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness. Lang: Lang: ...Was it really just an accident? If that's the truth, then what was the president doing here? Shaun: I-I don't know! There was no one else around when I was there! Lang: You expect me to believe that!? The president wouldn't have just come to a place like this without a reason, you know! Edgeworth: (Indeed, the president's reason for coming here is still a huge mystery... Two nights ago, he met with Judge Gravelle on the roof of the Grand Tower... ...and last night, he was here at the film lot. Did he meet with Shaun...? I'll have to listen to Shaun's testimony very carefully...!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. You are still young. I know it can get a little cold in early spring, but you shouldn't have to resort to a heater... Gravelle: Gravelle: It is precisely because he is young that he must make sure to take good care of himself! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: However, while it can get a bit chilly during this time of year, I wouldn't necessarily say... Shaun: Hold it, old man. Is this really the right time to be having this argument? Edgeworth: G..... Gah! (He's completely right.) Gravelle: Shaun. You did well to get the better of Mr. Edgeworth, but please mind your language. Edgeworth: (Let's not forget that he got the better of you too, Your Honor...) Shaun: I-I know, Mom... So, umm... where was I? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You forgot to turn off the heater? You didn't check it before leaving the roof? Shaun: I meant to turn it off, but I was too focused on practicing, so... And come on, everyone forgets stuff like that sometimes! Kay: Yeah, I gotcha! I forget small things like that all the time too! Like sometimes, I'll forget to turn off the AC or the lights in Mr. Edgeworth's office... ...or I'll jump off the ladder for his bookshelves, or leave prank calls on his answering machine. But forgetting to turn off the heater is really dangerous, so you've gotta be careful! Edgeworth: (Some of those things had nothing to do with forgetfulness...) Shaun. Please continue. Shaun: Looks like you've got it rough too, old man. Well, back to my story... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It was late at night at the film lot... and not a single member of the film crew was around. So then, why did you have to leave the premises in order to answer the phone call? Shaun: I totally forgot about the phone call thing... so I kinda panicked. If I didn't answer it fast, I would have been busted for leaving the hotel without permission. Edgeworth: In that case, why didn't you just answer it here? Shaun: B-Because I was rehearsing, all the cameras and mics were on. If I talked here, every last word I said to Mom would've been caught on camera! Edgeworth: (So he was embarrassed that the conversation with his mother would be recorded.) Shaun: Anyways, I stopped practicing for a bit and rushed out of the film lot. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that phone call, you lied and said you were at the hotel, correct? Kay: Why didn't you tell your mom that you were rehearsing? Shaun: If I told her that, she would've called the hotel and made them send me a taxi or something. Gravelle: Gravelle: Of course I would have! A child alone on the streets at the time of night... What sort of parent would allow their child to be in such a dangerous situation!? Edgeworth: Hmm. I guess kids just don't understand how their parents feel. Kay: It goes both ways, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Now then, Shaun. Please tell us about what happened after the phone call. Shaun: Huh? O-Oh yeah. Of course. When the call was finished and I came back here... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was there any indication that the head was about to fall? Shaun: ...I-I don't know. I was focused on my rehearsal. Edgeworth: So you forgot to turn off the heater, which led to a fire on the roof. I would think you should have at least heard something. Shaun: Heard something...? Oh, I was wearing headphones, so... Edgeworth: Headphones? Shaun: Listening to the movie's soundtrack helps me get into the scene... I had it on full blast. That's why I didn't hear anything. Edgeworth: And yet, you noticed your mother's incoming call? Shaun: I had my phone on vibrate, old man. That's how I noticed. Anyways, the head had fallen... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What was the state of the body? Shaun: ...I didn't get a good look. 'Cause it was dark. ........ Edgeworth: (Hm? He's suddenly become as quiet as a mouse.) Kay: I guess Shaun doesn't really want to remember anything about the body... Edgeworth: (...Is that the only reason why he's gone so quiet? Should I press him for more details?) Press him further Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Leave him be Edgeworth: (It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.) Edgeworth: You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead? Shaun: ! Th-That's... well... Edgeworth: (He's clearly shaken. ...He must be hiding something.) Wouldn't you normally call for help if you see someone collapsed on the ground? However, you did nothing of the sort... Shaun: But... But he...! He was already dead... Edgeworth: Is that so? You seem quite certain that the president was already dead... Now, is there a reason for that, I wonder? Shaun: The guy was collapsed on the ground, and right next to him was the fallen monster's head. I'm not stupid. It wasn't hard to imagine what happened... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You can imagine whatever you want, but there was no way for you to know that he was dead! You actually checked to make sure the president was dead, didn't you? Shaun: Urk.....! Y-Yeah... that's right! I was scared... but I got up close to the body and checked to see if he was breathing. Edgeworth: (I thought as much... However, why would he hide that? There must be a reason...) ...Please tell me the state of the body at that time. Shaun: A-At first, I didn't know he was dead... I would've realized sooner if there had been any blood... ...but there wasn't a single drop, and his clothes were completely spotless. Either way, he wasn't breathing. That's how I knew he was already dead... Edgeworth: ...Would you please append those statements to your testimony? Add statements: \"I didn't know right away that he was dead. There was no blood, and his clothes were spotless.\" and \"But he wasn't breathing at all when I checked, so I knew he was already dead.\" Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Edgeworth: (It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you knew immediately that it was the president? Shaun: Not right away. It was dark, so I had to get a bit closer. But... I knew his face because we worked together briefly, after all. Kay: Y-You worked with the president!? Wow, Shaun...! When did you do that!? Edgeworth: Have you already forgotten, Kay? The president had a cameo in this movie. Kay: Ah! That's right! Of course... N-Now I remember! Edgeworth: Good for you. So, Shaun. You confirmed he was dead? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were unable to tell if he was dead because of the lack of stains on his clothes... Are you certain of that? Shaun: Of course I am. You guys saw the body too, right? So what's the big ideal!? Edgeworth: You said that the area was dark. And yet, you were still able to make that observation? Shaun: I'm telling you, there wasn't a single stain on his entire body! Give it a rest, old man! Edgeworth: Heh... Thank you, Shaun. That was all I needed to hear. Kay: Are clean clothes that important to you, Mr. Edgeworth? Mine are freshly washed though! Edgeworth: Next... could you tell me how you determined that the president was dead? Shaun: Well, there wasn't anything to let me know right away that he was dead, you see... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did you check if he had stopped breathing? Shaun: They taught us how at school. You get right up close to the person's nose... ...and check to see if you can feel their breath. I never thought I'd have to do it for real, though... Kay: That was really brave of you, to be able to do something like that. Shaun, you sure are amazing for an elementary school kid. Edgeworth: Kay, he's in middle school. Please try to get that into your head sometime soon... Kay: It'd be pretty scary to see a corpse just suddenly appear out of the blue like that... Not to mention the fallen monster head lying next to the body. Edgeworth: Panic would certainly be an understandable response to such a situation. Kay: But still, all things considered... This was just an accident, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. That is, if we decide to take Shaun's words at face value... (I wouldn't mind having some more concrete details on the state of the crime scene...)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Kay Faraday\nDescription: A self-styled Great Thief and so-called \"second Yatagarasu\" who's always looking to bag the greatest treasure of all -- the truth.\nCharacter 1\nName: Lotta Hart\nDescription: A freelance photojournalist who I've met in the past.

    "cot": "The contradiction lies between the \"Security Camera Footage\" (Evidence 10) and Shaun's testimonies (Testimonies 2 to 5). \n\nThe \"Security Camera Footage\" shows that after the president and Judge Gravelle were on the rooftop, only Judge Gravelle was seen coming down the elevator alone, and the president was never recorded leaving the rooftop. This implies the president did not come down from the rooftop elevator after meeting Gravelle, which raises the question of how the president ended up dead at the film lot.\n\nMeanwhile, Shaun testifies that after his mother called him, he left the film lot (Testimony 2) and then came back later (Testimony 3) to find Moozilla's head had fallen and the president lying dead on the ground (Testimonies 4 and 5).\n\nThe contradiction is whether the president was still on the rooftop after meeting Judge Gravelle (as the camera footage implies he never left by elevator) versus Shaun’s testimony implying the president’s body was found on the film lot after Shaun returned from leaving to answer the phone call, indicating he fell from the rooftop or died at the lot.\n\nThus, the discrepancy between where the president was and what Shaun claims conflicts with the security footage of the president not leaving the rooftop.\n",

I reckon... yer through bein' a prosecutor, right? Edgeworth: Yes... that's true, I suppose. (I'm no longer a prosecutor. However...) Kay: You can't stop thinking about what Mr. de Killer said, right? Edgeworth: Indeed... de Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Edgeworth: (This case isn't over yet... The person in the red hood who kidnapped Kay at Gourd Lake... And this letter from an unknown sender. Someone's schemes are at work behind this case...) Lotta: Must be tough havin' a case you just solved still naggin' at the back of yer mind. Well, I got some investigatin' of my own to be doin', so I'll be off! Kay: That's amazing! You've already decided on your next scoop? Lotta: What're ya sayin' there, missy!? Don't you be underestimatin' the likes of Lotta Hart! I've covered a lotta scoops, ya know? I always have an extra scoop or two up my sleeves... ???: S-Someone! Help! Kay: Yikes! What's that!? ???: S-Someone! P-Please help! Edgeworth: (Hmm. This woman is...) What's happened!? ???: S-Somebody's dead! A m-monster...! Edgeworth: (A... monster?) Lotta: I-It's a scoop! A scoop's callin' me! ???: Please follow me! It's this way! Kay: Has something else happened? Again!? Edgeworth: I don't know... At any rate, we should follow her for now. Kay: Eh!? These are...!? Lotta: G-Genuine hoofprints! Edgeworth: (Hoofprints? Impossible! No animal could be this large...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Look! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang...! Why is he here?) Kay: Ah! Someone's on the ground! Edgeworth: (It can't be... The president of Zheng Fa... Di-Jun Huang!) Lang: ........ Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Lang: ......Mr. Prosecutor. Didn't take you long to get here. Edgeworth: What happened? Lang: What... happened? Ha! That's what I'd like to know! Edgeworth: (It would seem that he's in a considerable amount of shock over the president's death. However... ...what exactly are these giant footprints...? And what could have happened to the president?) Lotta: It's a m... m... monster! Edgeworth: A... monster? Lotta: Yessiree! Lookie here! Ain't no doubt about it, these are clearly the footprints of a monster! On this day, mankind received a grim reminder: we live in fear of the Mighty Moozilla! Edgeworth: (Mighty... Moozilla...?) Lotta: This here's a scoop! I got myself a scoop! \"Man Trampled to Death by Monster!\" I reckon it'll be the top story in tomorrow's paper! Edgeworth: (What nonsense... There are no such things as monsters... Wait, it can't be...?) Huang: I am Di-Jun Huang. I have heard of your deeds. You saved my country from a great crisis. Edgeworth: The real assassin was you all along...! de Killer: That is correct. I received a request from a key individual... ...to take the president's life... Edgeworth: (That man... could he have...?) Lang: Hey, you! Were you the first to discover the body? ???: Y-Yes, I...! Umm, well. Edgeworth: (! Agent Lang?) Lang: Lang Zi says: \"First come, first suspected.\" You! Did you really just discover the body!? ???: O-O-O-O-O-Of course! Kay: Please calm down! You're scaring her! Edgeworth: (He does seem to have lost his composure...) Lang: Tch. Calm down!? How am I supposed to calm down? Do you know who's been murdered!? Di-Jun Huang... the president of Zheng Fa! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. This isn't like you. Lang: ! Edgeworth: When we first met, you had an army of subordinates under your command... ...and you boasted of having the highest arrest rate in Interpol. And what now? Did you forget the fundamentals of investigation along with all of your men? Lang: What... did you say...? Edgeworth: Instead of questioning people at random, you should investigate the crime scene first. Am I wrong? Lang: ........Tch! I don't need you to tell me that. ...I'll do a thorough investigation. Edgeworth: (Well. At least it seems he's calmed for now...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Let's investigate too! Edgeworth: Yes. Let us investigate. (Right now, I do not have any investigation rights, but until the police arrive...) Lotta: What're y'all sayin'? Ain't it obvious who dunnit!? The man behind it all is the Mighty Moozilla! Hm? Well, I guess it ain't the \"man\" behind it, more like the \"monster\" behind it, ya know? Edgeworth: Good grief... Could you please just try not to interfere with the investigation? Lotta: Shut yer trap! Yer the one who better not be stickin' yer nose in my business! I ain't forgivin' ya if ya mess up my scoop! ???: Umm... Excuse me. Edgeworth: (Hmm. It's the woman who first discovered the body. I feel like I've seen her before...) ???: You're... Mr. Edgeworth, right? Do you remember me? Edgeworth: Umm. Y-Yes. That case... from before... Kay: Huh? Do you know her? Edgeworth: Yes, I do. (At least I think I do...) Kay: My name's Kay Faraday! I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! Penny: My. You have such a cute assistant? I'm Penny Nichols. I'm an assistant at Global Studios. I'm in charge of the props and sets. It's nice to meet you. Edgeworth: (Yes, that was it... I once handled a case that occurred during the filming of the Steel Samurai. This woman was a member of the show's staff, and she was involved in the incident. I must have met with her on numerous occasions over the course of the case... ...but to be honest, I had completely forgotten about her...) It's nice to see you again. The fact that you are here must mean that this place is... Penny: Yes! This is sort of an outdoor film lot for Global Studios. They're shooting a movie here right now. I was the first to arrive today, to set everything up for the filming... ...but everything seemed strange... Those giant footprints... and that... d-dead body... Edgeworth: I see. We shall examine the body. At any rate, could you please contact the police? Penny: Y-Yes! Right away! Edgeworth: (I'll have to take the time to listen to her story later... First, let's examine the scene. There are many things besides the body that concern me. I'll need to examine every nook and cranny of this place...) (Connecting \"Stepped on by a monster?\" and \"Monster's head\" Logic leads to:) Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. I'm going to take my leave here for a bit. There's something I have to check... Edgeworth: (Agent Lang. I wonder if he's caught onto something?) Hm? ???: ........ ........ Lang: ........ ???: .....Move it. Lang: What'd you say? Guess you're just a brat with no manners. ???: ...And you're an annoying old man. Quit your yapping already. Lang: ! Penny: I-I'm terribly sorry! Come on, Shaun! Lang: Tch! Penny: Oh! What were you doing!? ???: .......Who was that? Penny: Someone from the police! Why'd you suddenly pick a fight with him? ???: Hmph. Kay: That sure was a tense standoff! Edgeworth: (He didn't budge an inch, even before Agent Lang...) Penny: Ah! Allow me to introduce you! This is Shaun Fenn. He's the lead actor in our movie. Edgeworth: (The lead actor... is this child?) Kay: Hi! I'm Kay Faraday. Nice to meet you! Edgeworth: And this is Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth. Shaun: .......Prosecutor? Penny: He's a pretty famous prosecutor, you know. Shaun: But he's not wearing a prosecutor's badge. Edgeworth: Gah! (He's frightfully perceptive...) Penny: Ah! Shaun, it's probably better if you didn't go over there... Shaun: ............ Edgeworth: (That's certainly not a sight a child should see... However, he is someone involved with the case. I'll need to speak with him later.) (Connecting all possible Logic, examining ground around the body, original Moozilla model and table, clearing all \"Talk\" options of Penny and Shaun, and talking with Lotta leads to:) Edgeworth: And with that, this portion of the investigation seems to be finished. Kay: So the murder weapon really is... Edgeworth: Yes. As it stands now, the possibility that it was the monster head is quite high. Kay: So he ended up being squashed by the falling head, huh... Edgeworth: Hm? Lang: Although they're extremely late to the party, the bodyguards and the police have finally arrived. Bodyguard: Mr. President! Lang: They really were... far too late. Bodyguard: Damn it! Who did this!? Lang: ...They'll pay for this. I swear I'll make them pay. But you know, this much is enough to put me at ease. The person who did this to Huang... ...I've already got my eye on a suspect. Edgeworth: What? What do you mean? Lang: Even though Huang was the victim, he doesn't have extraterritorial rights here. Your country's police have the right to investigate. However, I've already spoken with them. As an agent of Interpol, they're letting me assist in the investigation... Edgeworth: ...So they've already established a plan for this investigation? Lang: I've already found my prey. Now it's time for the hunt... ...Take a look at this. It's a printout from a security camera on the Grand Tower rooftop. Edgeworth: Th... This is! Lang: This camera records people as they get off the rooftop elevator. And guess who was recorded? The president and his killer can be clearly seen! Kay: Wh-Why is Ms. Gravelle there!? Edgeworth: (So he's saying Judge Gravelle is the murder?) Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste! Edgeworth: (Could she, who hates crime more than anyone, have...?) Security Camera Photo jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. I'd like to hear your thoughts. Lang: Lang: ............ Just now, I heard a rumor at the Grand Tower. Miles Edgeworth, that you... are no longer a \"prosecutor\". Edgeworth: ! Lang: Naturally, that means you don't even have a shred of investigate authority. So what would be the point of having a logic battle with someone like you? Edgeworth: (Hmph...!) Kay: Why would you say something like that!? Didn't you also just get reduced to being a lone agent!? Lang: .......... Hey. Answer me this. Even though you've lost your position as a \"prosecutor\"... ...why are you sticking your neck into this case? Edgeworth: ........ (Why do I still continue to investigate...?) Agent Lang... Why are you pursuing the criminal who murdered the president? Because you're an Interpol agent? Lang: .......... Edgeworth: Right now, I am also chasing after a certain person. Someone in the shadows, who was behind the murder at the Grand Tower yesterday... Someone who placed Kay in grave danger. ...Even now, they are lurking somewhere, laughing at us. We will uncover the truth, and bring them to justice... ...and a title such as \"prosecutor\" has nothing to do with it. As long as the truth remains hidden... ...I will continue to seek out that truth. For that is a part of my creed. Lang: ........Haha! You... You're always trying to be so clever, but you really are kind of an idiot. Edgeworth: (Hmph. Me, an idiot? How rude...) Lang: That's the answer I wanted to hear. ...Alright, I'll play along with you for a bit. I've lost all my men, and you've lost your title. And yet, we still continue to investigate... Let's begin this battle of logic between two kindred spirits! Edgeworth: You have my thanks... Lang: However, I won't go easy on you. I'll definitely catch the criminal who murdered Huang. And I won't let you get in my way! Edgeworth: Yes... I wouldn't have it any other way! Lang: Let me show you the truth that this wolf has sunk his fangs into! Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower. Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president! Edgeworth: It was just the two of them alone on the rooftop... No bodyguards? Lang: Yeah. I confirmed it with those bodyguards over there. They didn't know about it either. Guess he managed to give them the slip. He must've had something secret to talk about. Edgeworth: (President Huang and Judge Gravelle... Did those two have some sort of connection?) Lang: Apparently, he had an arrangement with the owner of the Grand Tower. He requested the entrance to the viewing platform be restricted so that they could be alone. Well, it's not like the owner could turn down a request from the president. Kay: Does that mean... the last person to see the president was... Lang: Exactly... Gravelle, you mean? It's gotta be her! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang's reasoning is certainly sound... However, he has overlooked one major thing...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower. Lang: Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. Lang: At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. Lang: There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang has overlooked something major...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Edgeworth: Shi-Long Lang... For the Interpol agent with the highest arrest rate to have fallen so low. Lang: What'd you say...!? Edgeworth: This is a commemorative photo taken by the staff at Global Studios. Kay: Everyone's got such great smiles! ...Well, except for Shaun. Edgeworth: This photo was taken yesterday. Lang: What!? Edgeworth: If Judge Gravelle had murdered the president two days ago... ...then his body should have been there when this photo was taken! Lang: Owwoooooooh! Lang: Heh. Perhaps you should have listened a bit more carefully to those involved in the case. Questioning witnesses is one of the basic fundamentals of an investigation, is it not? Kay: I've captured Mr. Edgeworth's great smile! You really do look most alive when you're cornering your opponent! Lang: Grr... Just as I expected. It's been a while since I've felt like this. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, haven't you been a little hasty in your reasoning? Lang: ........Tch. I don't need your advice. Lang Zi says: \"The wrath of a wolf lasts a hundred years.\" My anger towards the woman who killed the president cannot be suppressed. Edgeworth: I, too, wish to capture the culprit. However... ...there is no doubt that the body appeared here last night. Therefore... the president could not have fallen to his death. Kay: Yeah! He was crushed by the monster head! Edgeworth: The crime occurred here at the film lot, not on the rooftop of the Grand Tower. Lang: Lang: So, that's what you think. Still, I don't intend to stray from my logic either. Edgeworth: However, he could not have fallen to his death two nights ago. This photo proves that... Lang: Is that so? Think about it this way... Two nights ago, Gravelle pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body. Edgeworth: In here? Lang: Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Once we search this area, we'll know where she hid the body. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Unfortunately, there is no need for a search. Lang: What'd you say!? Edgeworth: This piece of evidence proves that Judge Gravelle could not have hidden the body! Edgeworth: All the entrances to the film lot were locked. The chain on the back entrance was only cut last night. Lang: What!? Edgeworth: Therefore, Judge Gravelle could not have entered the film lot two nights ago! Lang: Aiyaaaaa! But the president could only have fallen two nights ago! Edgeworth: ...Why are you so insistent that the crime occurred two days ago? Lang: Why...? Because there's still more to the security camera footage. Lang: A photo was recorded 10–20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman. That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone. After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all! There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there? Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is! Edgeworth: The president never came down from the rooftop? Lang: That's right. The security camera is always watching the entrance of the elevator. It was specifically set up to record anyone who entered or exited the rooftop. Essentially, the camera created a locked room... one which the president vanished from! Edgeworth: (A locked room... I see. This is quite an unfavorable piece of evidence for Judge Gravelle...) Security Camera Photo data updated in my Organizer. Kay: A rooftop escape! That's a difficult feat! Edgeworth: So even the Yatagarasu can't just fly through the sky. Kay: That's right. I... I still need more training to be able to pull that off. Edgeworth: (Are you saying you're going to train yourself to fly?) Lang: A photo was recorded 10–20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman. Lang: That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone. Lang: After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all! Lang: There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there? Lang: Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is! Edgeworth: (A locked room created by the security camera... Is falling off the roof really the only way to escape this locked room?) Edgeworth: As a matter of fact, there was one. A hidden route... that is. Lang: A way down without using the elevator!? You'd better not tell me he flew off or something! Edgeworth: There's no need for that. It's quite simple. The president just needed to know... ...about the existence of the hidden 51st floor. Lang: The 51st floor? Edgeworth: This building has a hidden 51st floor. It is accessible through a secret hatch on the rooftop. Using that route, it would be possible to leave the rooftop without using the elevator. Lang: Lang: Hidden room? Secret hatch? How could the president have even known about that? Edgeworth: I wonder? I don't know the answer myself. I am merely raising a possibility. Lang: In the first place, what's this all about? This hidden 51st floor. Sounds like something that ninja girl over there would love to get into! Kay: No way! I'm sick of that place! Edgeworth: (For Kay, that place only holds bad memories, after all.) The 51st floor was a secret storeroom for the black market auction. Its true purpose was only exposed yesterday. Lang: ...Black market auction? You... You aren't suggesting the president was involved in something like that, are you? Edgeworth: I have no proof. However, the possibility exists, does it not? Kay: Hmm. I wouldn't put it past that president. Lang: HOOOOOOOOOOWWWL! Kay: Eek! Lang: Impossible! The president would never...! He would never be involved in a black market auction! Edgeworth: (Wh... What's this?) Lang: You punks. Are you prepared? If you're gonna spout nonsense like that... I'll tear you into pieces! Kay: Eeeeeek! Edgeworth: (...She ran away.) Lang: You don't have any idea! The amount of respect that man has earned from his country's people! Edgeworth: (I see... We have seen the president's true colors. However, the people of Zheng Fa remain in the dark... Should I inform Agent Lang of the president's true nature? No. Telling him now would only further cloud his judgment...) I understand, Agent Lang. Please calm down. We spoke out of line... I apologize. Lang: ......Sorry. My emotions got the best of me. And Kay, how long do you plan on hiding? You can come out now. Kay: ...I'm sorry. Lang: ...It's fine. My anger is directed towards the president's killer. Lotta: Well, I'll be! Yer actually a pretty good guy, ain't ya? That loyalty to yer president! It's mighty admirable! Lang: Heh. What's it to you? Lotta: Aww, don't be like that. I've got some good news for ya, I reckon. Lang: What? Lotta: The president ain't never passed through the 51st floor. Ya can count on me! Lang: Really? Lotta: I was in the storeroom myself, and I saw it with my very own eyes! Edgeworth: (That's right... She snuck into the storeroom that day.) Lotta's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer. Lang: ...Thanks. ...Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: What is it? Lang: I don't intend to give the culprit a single step of leeway. No one's seen the president since he met with Gravelle two days ago. Edgeworth: That doesn't change the fact that the body wasn't here yesterday. If he were pushed off two days ago, it would be odd that he wasn't found until yesterday. I doubt a fall from the rood would take a whole day. Lang: I'll admit, there are a few things I still haven't figured out. Edgeworth: Regardless... there is one thing I am certain of. Kay: There is? Edgeworth: What exactly occurred here last night? I'm certain we'll have to look into that in order to uncover the truth. Kay: Because the body and the hoofprints could have only appeared last night, right? Officer: Agent Lang! We'd like to bring the body in for the autopsy... Lang: Huang..... It's in your hands. Make sure you show the proper respect. Officer: I also have one more thing to report... Lang: What is it? Officer: We found some footprints near the body! Umm... They were left within the area that looks like a monster's footprint. Edgeworth: (There were human footprints within the monster's footprint?) Lang: What kind of footprints? Officer: Sir! They were the footprints of a child! About the size of an elementary school student! Edgeworth: What!? Penny: Huh!? Kay: A-An elementary school student!? Wait... Could it be...? Edgeworth: (Who... was that?) Penny: U-Umm...! Edgeworth: (Ms. Nichols?) Penny: I... I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you! Please excuse my rudeness! Edgeworth: Is there something you want to say? (What is she so scared of?) Penny: I'm worried that you'll think poorly of me, but... ...please let me testify something! It's really important! Edgeworth: (That's not something you need to be so worried about...) What is it? Penny: Last night... I... I actually came here. Lang: What!? Penny: Eek! Edgeworth: Why did you come here? Penny: ...Well, I got a little worried, so I stopped by... ...to check up on Shaun. Edgeworth: Shaun... You mean Shaun Fenn? (As I thought...) Penny: Yes. Last night, umm... Shaun stayed here late in order to practice by myself. Kay: Wow! He's really dedicated! Penny: Well, this movie is the first time he's starring as the lead role, so... ...I'm sure he wants to do his best...! Edgeworth: (She must have witnessed something last night...) When was this? Penny: Umm... If I remember correctly, I think it was a little past 10 PM. It looked like it was going to rain, and I was getting worried, so I came to check up on him. And when I got here... Well... I, umm... Lang: You... saw something? Penny: .....Y-Yes. Shaun was practicing by himself... ...and right above his head... I saw... a long... long... neck. Kay: A neck? Penny: Y-Yes! Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile... It was like... the neck of a dinosaur! Lotta: Whooooooahhh there! C-Could that've been... ...G-G-Gourdy!? Last time I went huntin' for it, it was a bust... but I reckon, this could be the real deal! Kay: What!? So this time it's Gourdy!? Penny: Th-That's right! I was really surprised! A-After all, Shaun is the boy who can communicate with Moozilla! Lotta: Yeah! That's right! Them horns of his lets him hear what the monster's sayin', right? Penny: E-Even so! He was looking up at Gourdy's face and he was talking to it! It was like they were friends! D-Doesn't that sound weird!? Lotta: You said it, sister! That's pretty darn strange, I reckon! That boy's a little traitor! Edgeworth: (...It seems she's gotten reality mixed up with the movies...) Lang: Hey, Missy... Did you really see that? Penny: Yes! But I was so shocked, I immediately ran home after that. Lang: What do you make of this, Mr. Prosecutor? Has another monster taken the stage? Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Do you really believe this absurd testimony? Lang: Hahahahaha! I couldn't care less about the monsters. However, it looks like who we need to talk to next has been decided now, hasn't it? Edgeworth: Shaun Fenn... He was here last night. It's very likely he saw something... isn't it? Lang: Atta boy! Lang: Shaun Fenn...! We've got some questions for you! ................ Penny: U-Umm... Shaun kind of left a while ago. Lang: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Kay: L-Let's go after him! Lang: Tch! Where'd he run off to!? Edgeworth: He might have just gone back home. Kay: That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today! Lang: ...Or he may have run away. Kay: A-Aren't you just overthinking things? Edgeworth: He's still a child. I can't imagine that he could have murdered the president by himself. Lang: Who said he was alone? Maybe that monster helped him. That boy can summon a monster to his aid, right? Edgeworth: Hmph. Very funny. Lang: I'm not saying that kid's definitely the culprit. But right now, he's the most prominent witness we have, So, we'll need to find that brat. Gumshoe: Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Kay: Ah! Gummy! Gumshoe: Uuugh... I, I... I...! Kay: He ran away... Edgeworth: (What is the detective doing...?) Lang: It doesn't matter... It's not like I can rely on this country's police anyways. Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. Do you intend to continue investigating by yourself? Lang: Yeah. That's right. You got a problem with that? Kay: Didn't you always have a small army of subordinates with you before? Lang: That's right... But, you know, being a lone wolf isn't all that bad. You don't have to worry about your subordinates or partners. All you need are your fangs. Simple, right? Edgeworth: (Subordinates... and partners...?) Lang: Well then. I'll be seeing you two. Lotta: He he he he. Things are gettin' interestin'! I reckon I'm about to get real busy myself! After all, I got me a pair of monsters to hunt! I'm definitely gettin' my hands on this scoop! Kay: Things have gotten pretty crazy, haven't they? Edgeworth: Indeed. There's the footprints of Moozilla, and now the shadow of Gourdy... It's almost exactly like the movie. Kay: How about we go monster hunting too? Edgeworth: Well... (Hm? Isn't that...?) Kay: Isn't that one of Lang's men...? Edgeworth: (He's one of Agent Lang's subordinates. We met him during another case.) Excuse me... MIB: Oh, Prosecutor Edgeworth. It has been a while. Kay: Shouldn't you be following Mr. Lang? MIB: Agent Lang... Shifu... is no longer my boss. Edgeworth: What exactly happened? MIB: Do you remember the incident from one month ago? Edgeworth: (The \"Yatagarasu Incident\" we had been involved with.) MIB: Agent Lang made a major mistake back then. He almost aided and abetted a dangerous criminal. Edgeworth: (Certainly... it had come quite close to that at the time.) MIB: Shifu took responsibility for what happened... and our team was disbanded. Kay: Disbanded...? Edgeworth: So that's what Agent Lang was talking about when he said he had become a lone wolf. Kay: Then... Why are you here? MIB: That's..... Well. I was a little worried about Shifu. ...It seems that even now, he's still chasing after them. The ghosts of 12 years past... Edgeworth: Ghosts of 12 years past? Just what are you... MIB: .......... I'm sorry. I've already said too much. If you'll excuse me... Edgeworth: (These ghosts Agent Lang is chasing after... Do they also have something to do with this case?) Kay: Looks like everyone's left now... So, what do we do now? Edgeworth: Well... Ms. Hart is going after the monsters, and Agent Lang is going after Shaun. We should also try approaching this case from a different angle. Kay: What angle would that be? Edgeworth: ...We should listen to what Judge Gravelle has to say. Kay: Ah! That's right! If I'm not mistaken, Ms. Gravelle is... Gravelle: ...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Fifi Laguarde's trial. Kay: She said that she had a trial coming up! Edgeworth: Indeed. Let's head to the courthouse as well. Kay: 'Kay! To be continued. Gravelle: Court is now in session. Is the defense ready? Ray: Of course, Your Honor! We can begin whenever you want. Franziska: The prosecution has been ready from the start, Your Honor. Edgeworth: Jill Crane, the attorney in charge of the defense, has passed on from this world. Furthermore, Sebastian Debeste, the prosecutor-in-charge, has disappeared... And so, Franziska and Mr. Shields have taken over their duties. Gravelle: Before we begin, I would like to apologize for the delay of today's trial. As the crime took place in the prison, a place where justice is normally administered... ...and the defendant was the warden of the prison, further exacerbating the situation... ...additional time was specially arranged to investigate and prepare for the trial. In addition, the defense attorney in charge of the case, Jill Crane, has recently passed away... Due to these circumstances, the trial was further delayed. Mr. Shields, Ms. von Karma. At this time, I'd like to give you my gratitude for taking up this responsibility on short notice. Ray: I guess this is the last job Gravelle-pie's friend left behind for us, huh? Well, Uncle Ray's more than happy to help out. Although having said that, I only had enough time to skim through the case files... Are you OK on your end, Franny-pie? Franziska: What kind of prosecutor abandons his own case and vanishes without a trace...!? I won't allow any more delays in this trial while we wait for that foolish man to return. I have received the evidence just now. There should be no problem continuing the trial. Gravelle: ...You have my thanks. And with that, I hereby call the defendant, Fifi Laguarde, to the stand. Laguarde: ........ Gravelle: Now then, will the prosecution please give us their opening statement? Franziska: Very well, Your Honor. The defendant... Laguarde: ...Please wait, Your Honor. Gravelle: What is it? Laguarde: Well, there's something I'd like you to fill me in on. Just what exactly... am I doing in a place like this? Gravelle: Then perhaps... you would do well to listen to the opening statement. Laguarde: Hmm. So if I listen to it, I'll get it, huh? OK then, let's hear it. Franziska: ...That was the plan from the start. Now, if you would kindly shut up and listen. The incident occurred in the detention center and the prison Warden Laguarde is in charge of. The victim is Horace Knightley, who was being held in the detention center. The prosecution is certain that this woman here is the culprit. This knife, the murder weapon, is the decisive evi..... Huh!? Gravelle: Ms. von Karma. Is something wrong? Franziska: Th-That's... impossible! The evidence is...! Ray: What's wrong with the evidence, Franny-pie? Franziska: The evidence... the knife's gone! The chisel with Kanis's bell attached to it is missing too! Ray: Wh... Whaaat!? Gravelle: Order! Order! Prosecutor von Karma. What is the meaning of this? Franziska: I... I don't understand it either, Your Honor. Laguarde: If there's no evidence, then I suppose there's not much reason for me to be here. Some prosecutor. Can't even hold on to one little piece of evidence. What a dunce. Franziska: I... I only received everything that the previous prosecutor had... Ah! Ray: ...It appears the culprit is that pampered prosecutor, the Boy Blunder. Hey, Gravelle-pie. Gravelle: What is it? Ray: Your Honor! Considering our predicament, what say we postpone the trial until later? Gravelle: Gravelle: The defense's proposal is overruled. Ray: Eh? Gravelle-pie...? Laguarde: I know, right? It'd be troubling for me if this trial were to be delayed any further. I just want everyone to know that I'm innocent. As soon as possible. Franziska: Franziska: Innocent!? I've had more than enough of your foolish... Laguarde: And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... \"In court, evidence is everything.\" Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor? Gravelle: .......... That is correct. Franziska: Eh! Ray: What!? Gravelle: The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Fifi Laguarde... Ray: Ray: Hold your horses, Gravelle-pie! You can't just declare her innocent all of a sudden! Gravelle: Is something the matter? For the defense to object to a \"not guilty\" verdict... Ray: Well, I mean... Even you must know that the warden over there is guilty, right? You were there with us when we found the murder weapon! Gravelle: ........ Mr. Shields. A judge must remain impartial when handing down a verdict. That is why I cannot allow myself to get caught up in my own personal feelings... The person who was present when the murder weapon was discovered... ...and the judge sitting before you now, are two completely different people. Ray: ...You're kidding, right? Gravelle: I can only hand down a verdict based upon the evidence that was presented. Franziska: Franziska: There is evidence! It's just... Well, it's not here right now, but... A few minutes, that's all I need! I'll find the evidence and return to court, without fail! The prosecution requests a brief recess, Your Honor! Gravelle: ........ Ray: Th-The defense would also like a recess, Your Honor. Gravelle-pie. Please... Gravelle: ........ ...I understand. I shall grant your request. Laguarde: Well! Verity-darling! Aren't you wishy-washy today? Gravelle: This court will now adjourn for a 15 minute recess! During with, the prosecution and the defense shall prepare for the resumption of the trial. Franziska: ...Understood, Your Honor. Ray: Phew. That was a close one. Gravelle: Court is now adjourned! Kay: Didn't we find it together!? The evidence! Edgeworth: Yes, we certainly did. Gumshoe: Huh? Edgeworth: What's the matter, Detective? Gumshoe: It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator. Kay: Really! Why? Edgeworth: (Of course, that's why the metal detector reacted!) Judge Gravelle, I'd like you to take a look at this. Gravelle: The chisel...? Debeste: Wasn't that just the fake murder weapon? Edgeworth: Kanis hid this chisel inside this dog's mouth. And the real murder weapon was hidden in very much the same way... Laguarde: ...! Edgeworth: The real murder weapon is in the pond, inside the alligator! Edgeworth: I wonder if it was stolen by someone... ???: Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Ms. Berry and Mr. Saint. Did you come to attend the trial? Regina: I came because I heard there's a really fun show around here! So, where is it? Simeon: The trial for the case I got caught up in was supposed to have already started, but... ..our practice ran a little late. I believe it was somewhere around here, wasn't it? Kay: Actually, two key pieces of evidence have gone missing: the chisel and the knife... The trial is in recess now. Sort of like an intermission. You just missed it, Simeon. Simeon: Wha... Whaaaaaat!? Wh-wh-wh-what's that supposed to mean!? Regina: Ah ha ha! Looks like Simeon's going to get arrested again! Simeon: Eeeeeeeeeek! Nowaynowaynoway, I can't...! Kay: Hmm. I guess Simeon is his usual noisy self. ...Huh? ???: To think that I would be humiliated like this! Edgeworth: ...And here comes another noisy individual. Ray: Now, now, Franny-pie. Let's just take a moment and calm down a bit. Maybe you could put that whip of yours away, him? Whaddaya say? Franziska: That foolish prosecutor! When I get my hands on him... ...my whip is going to give him the thrashing of a lifetime! Ray: Eek! Miles, why don't you try talking to her? Edgeworth: (Good grief... On that note, I guess I should probably hear what she has to say.) (Clearing all \"Talk\" options of Franziska and Ray leads to:) Ray: If only there were someone who could go search for the evidence for us... ........ Edgeworth: ........ .....Very well. I'll go look for them. Ray: Oh! Miles! You'd do that for us? Edgeworth: Of course, finding the evidence within fifteen minutes will be no easy task. Ray: Well, if worse comes to worst, Uncle Ray and Franny-pie will help you stall for time. Franziska: .......... Ray: Until you recover the evidence, we won't let her hand down a verdict. Edgeworth: Please do so. ...Franziska, are you OK with this? Franziska: .....You're asking me, Franziska von Karma, to help you out? You'd be better off spending the rest of your life as an anchorman for the local news... Ray: Ms. von Karma. This is an emergency. We could really use your cooperation. Franziska: ! Hmph... I understand. As acting prosecutor, I, along with that attorney over there, shall continue this trial. Meanwhile, you, the \"former\" prosecutor shall run around and look for the evidence... ...all for my sake. It's a job that suits you perfectly! Edgeworth: ...I'm glad that you're on board. Simeon: I-I'll help out too! ...'Cause I really don't wanna get arrested again. Regina: This sounds like fun! Regina wants to tag along too! Edgeworth: Alright. That would be helpful. Now then, where should we begin? Kay: I think we should go find that person, and hear what they have to say! Edgeworth: Who should we talk to in order to learn where the evidence went? Edgeworth: Yes. The person in charge of the evidence was Sebastian Debeste. Simeon: Ah, you mean that rookie prosecutor, right? Got it! Edgeworth: I'll leave him to you. Ray: Alright. Time for Uncle Ray to have a strategy meeting with the opposing counsel. ...Just the two of uUUAAAGH! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... You better not keep me waiting. Lest you end up like your friend here. Edgeworth: Yes.... I'll keep that in mind. Ray: Franny-pie, wait for meeeee! Edgeworth: Now then, let's go help look for Sebastian as well. Kay: Ah! Edgeworth: (Judge Gravelle...) Gravelle: ...If it isn't Prosecutor Edgeworth. I hope that all is well. Kay: All is NOT well! Just what was going on in that trial earlier...? Edgeworth: Kay! There's no need for that. Kay: But...! Even though Ms. Gravelle should know exactly who the culprit is... What made you...? Gravelle: ........ In a court of law, the only thing that truly matters is evidence... Whatever my own feelings may be, it should not affect the verdict. Edgeworth: So, is this the \"Judge persona\" of Verity Gravelle we're seeing? Gravelle: Cold-blooded and heartless... It's fine if you think of me as such. Edgeworth: (Even as a judge, she's still this stubborn?) Judge Gravelle. There's just... one thing I'd like to ask you. Gravelle: And what would that be? Edgeworth: Two nights ago... you went to the roof of the Grand Tower. Gravelle: ! The roof... you say? Edgeworth: You met with the president there, correct? The two of you were caught on the security camera. Gravelle: Is there some sort of problem with that? Edgeworth: Today... The president's body was discovered. Very close to the Grand Tower. Gravelle: Th-That's...! Edgeworth: You understand now, don't you? You're a suspect. ...What happened between you and the president up on the roof? Gravelle: Nothing... We merely spoke for a few minutes. Once our business was done, I headed straight home. I took the elevator back down alone. Edgeworth: Indeed. That was shown on the security camera footage as well. What exactly did you and the president talk about? Gravelle: Th-That... I cannot say. Edgeworth: (I see. However, I cannot afford to let up just yet. That being the case... Heh. I guess my only remaining options is to use that. She is definitely hiding something...! And I'm going to draw it out of her!) Edgeworth: Two nights ago, Judge Gravelle met with President Huang... Gravelle: ........ Gravelle: ...It is true that I spoke with President Huang on the roof of the Grand Tower. However, we only discussed business. There is no need to tell you what was said. Edgeworth: Hmm... Just like in the trial earlier, she won't reveal her personal feelings easily. When she's speaking as a judge, it would be better for me to wait and see what develops. Now then, I'll start by asking her what she talked about with the president! Edgeworth: Could you tell me... what you and the president talked about? Gravelle: My meeting with the president was strictly business. And since it has nothing to do with you, I am not obligated to answer your question. Edgeworth: ...... Gravelle: I appreciate your understanding. Edgeworth: Even so... You certainly are a very busy person, aren't you? You're a member of the P.I.C. and a judge as well. You even assist with the investigations. Gravelle: I am simply fulfilling the professional duties that have been assigned to me. Edgeworth: Was your meeting with the president also one of the duties assigned to you as a judge? Gravelle: .....Yes. Of course it was. I... am one who lives for the law. I would never act outside my professional duties. Edgeworth: This morning, you returned Kay's \"promise notebook\" to me. I don't believe that all of yours actions are simply done for the sake of your duties. Gravelle: .....It's true, it seems I still retain some immature qualities. Edgeworth: I wouldn't call it immature. It was your own personal kindness. Weren't you also distressed when you found out the president had passed away? Gravelle: Yes... It is very unfortunate... Why did he have to die...? Edgeworth: It seems he was crushed by the head of a monster called the \"Mighty Moozilla\". Ah... Excuse me. You see, Moozilla is... Gravelle: I-Is that true!? You mean... the president died at the temporary Moozilla film lot...? Edgeworth: Yes. That's right... I'm surprised that you know about Moozilla. Gravelle: Y-Yes... I had heard about it from Sebastian. He told me that the movie was being filmed near the Grand Tower... Edgeworth: ...She seems awfully shaken up about that. And I'm also curious about Sebastian, who went missing along with the evidence. She said she wouldn't talk about the president... However, I might be able to get her to reveal her secret through another line of questioning. She is flustered beyond normal. There must be some reason behind it! Edgeworth: Franziska may have taken over the prosecution in Sebastian's place, however... ...as long as he still possesses some of the evidence, the trial cannot proceed. Gravelle: I intend to carry out a fair trial. If the prosecution is unable to present evidence... the defendant must be declared not guilty. Edgeworth: ...... Gravelle: I am a judge. I cannot allow my own personal feelings to get in the way. Edgeworth: So, you're saying you're not the least bit worried about Sebastian's whereabouts? Gravelle: Of course... I am... I am worried about Sebastian, as well, but... Edgeworth: You're worried about Sebastian \"as well\"? Wouldn't that mean... ...that there is someone else you're worried about? Gravelle: Ah...! Edgeworth: By any chance... would that person have something to do with your unnatural behavior? Gravelle: ...That's impossible. I... ...I am a follower of the law... I will not... be swayed by... personal feelings. Edgeworth: It may be true that those who stand in court have a duty to follow the law. However, we're not superheroes! You and I are only human. It is impossible to completely ignore your own feelings and render an impartial judgement! Gravelle: Aaaaaaah! .....It is as you say. As I am now... I cannot hand down an impartial verdict. Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Why don't you tell me the truth? Gravelle: I... I...! Just what am I supposed to do...!? Edgeworth: For Judge Gravelle to become this distraught... I should find out exactly who she is searching for. Up until now, she has been wearing the mask of a judge... This time, I should be able to draw out her true feelings! Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: Earlier, when Moozilla was brought up, it seemed to be a sensitive topic for you... Is that \"child\" you spoke of involved with the Moozilla movie? Gravelle: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! H-How!? How do you know that...!? Edgeworth: You're usually so calm, yet you seem rather distraught right now. Please, tell me... Who is that child!? Gravelle: ...I understand. If you've come to know this much... I shall prepare myself for the worst. The child I'm searching for... is a boy by the name of Shaun Fenn. Edgeworth: Shaun...? Why do you want to know his whereabouts? Gravelle: Well... That much, I simply cannot say... Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Didn't you say you were prepared for the worst!? Gravelle: .....! Edgeworth: Even if you don't intend to talk, I am determined to expose the truth. ...That is my resolve. Why is she searching for Shaun... I must get her to tell me the reason. Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: I don't know what kind of relationship you have with Shaun... ...but at the very least, the two of you must be acquaintances! Gravelle: E... Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Won't you allow us to help you in your search for him? Gravelle: Help...? No, that won't be allowed? Edgeworth: Who won't allow it? The so-called Goddess of Law? Gravelle: ...The person who knows where that child is.. Edgeworth: I see... Finally, I've connected all the pieces of the puzzle. The reason why you cannot easily talk about Shaun... It was because... Someone kidnapped him, isn't that right? Gravelle: A-Aah... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: ...Judge Gravelle. I would like to hear the truth from your own lips. Gravelle: .....I understand. This time... I will truly be prepared for the worst. It is just as you deduced... Someone has kidnapped Shaun. Edgeworth: ! As I thought... There was a kidnapping! Still, how is Shaun's kidnapping related to you in any way? Gravelle: ......Shaun and I are... ...mother and child... Edgeworth: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? I was unable to learn much about the conversation she had with the president, but... ...I have learned of Shaun's kidnapping. ...It was an unexpected result, but with that... it's checkmate. Gravelle: ....... Kay: Whaaat!? J-Shaun is... Ms. Gravelle's son!? No way! I mean, he's already so big, for him to be your... Gravelle: Yes... Shaun is indeed my son. Please look at this... Edgeworth: (This is a clipping from a magazine...) Kay: It's an article about Shaun! Do you always carry this around with you? Gravelle: Yes. I always keep it close by. It's like a charm to me... Edgeworth: (It seems the bond that they share is a strong one.) Gravelle: ....... Edgeworth: However, are you absolutely certain that he's been kidnapped? Gravelle: Yes. I received a call from the kidnapper just before the trial started... Edgeworth: What were their demands? Gravelle: They had only one demand. A \"Not Guilty\" verdict for Fifi Laguarde... Edgeworth: (I see. So that's what happened...) Laguarde: And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... \"In court, evidence is everything.\" Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor? Gravelle: .......... That is correct. The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Fifi Laguarde... Edgeworth: So, that's why you were going to deliver a \"Not Guilty\" verdict earlier? Gravelle: I am... not qualified to be a judge... A judge must be able to remain impartial and composed, above all else. And yet... despite this, in the trial just now, I... ...I was about to hand down a verdict that was led solely by my heart! Edgeworth: .....Judge Gravelle. Gravelle: The Goddess of Law must be furious with me... ...but, I simply couldn't do it. I couldn't hand down a fair verdict... if it meant I had to sacrifice my own son! Kay: Of course you can't! Edgeworth: (Kay...) Kay: A real parent... would never abandon their own child! If that makes the Goddess of Law angry, then maybe the Goddess is the one who's wrong! The Goddess is guilty! Guilty! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Indeed. (To declare a goddess guilty...) We're responsible for upholding the law, but at the same time, we are only human. Nobody would hand down a verdict that would sacrifice their own child. Gravelle: .....Thank you very much. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth. However... I cannot simply run away from the courtroom. Bailiff: Judge Gravelle! So this is where you've been. Gravelle: It appears it's time... Kay: .......... Ms. Gravelle! ...My father, he was a prosecutor. Gravelle: Your father...? Kay: Yes. He stood in court, just like you. ...And now, with all that has happened, it got me thinking... What if, my father had been in the same position as you are now? Gravelle: If a prosecutor was being coerced into obtaining a guilty verdict... Kay: I know... if my life were on the line, my father... ...would definitely come to steal me back! Gravelle: Steal you... back? Kay: Ms. Gravelle. Why don't you let us take care of it? Gravelle: What...? Kay: I'm gonna go steal Shaun back for you! As the second Yatagarasu, I, Kay Faraday, give you my word! Gravelle: ...... Edgeworth: (Heh. So, the Great Thief Yatagarasu plans to steal the \"truth\", huh...) What say you, Judge Gravelle? Will you place your trust in our young Great Thief? Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth... Edgeworth: And, if it's alright with you, I wish to help as well. Gravelle: .....Thank you very much. I know that it's really not my place to ask this of you... ...but please... do whatever you can... Please save Shaun. Kay: You got it! Just leave everything to us! Gravelle: Allow me to leave my cellphone with you. You may get a call from the kidnapper at some point. Edgeworth: You have my word. I will ensure the safe return of your phone, alone with your son. Gravelle: And I will do everything in my power to prolong the trial. But... even then, at most the trial can only last for about two more hours... Edgeworth: (Two hours, huh... So, until 2 PM. That's our time frame...) Gravelle: ...I must return to court. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall leave the rest to you. Edgeworth: Heh. Kay, I thought you were taking a break from being the Great Thief? Kay: As of right now, the Great Thief Yatagarasu is back in business! Alright! Time to put on the gloves and hit the pavement! It's my first request, after all! Edgeworth: Is that so? In that case, we'd better begin our investigation posthaste... ...if we hope to track down Shaun... Lang: Tch! Where'd he run off to!? Edgeworth: He might have just gone back home. Kay: That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today! Lang: ...Or he may have run away. Edgeworth: We should probably begin our investigation from the front of the Grand Tower. Kay: H-Hey! Hold it, Mr. Edgeworth! You're not the one in charge anymore! From here on out, this is a job for a Great Thief! Which means, I'm the leader now! Edgeworth: ...If that's the case, then what am I supposed to do? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, you get to be... the first ever Great Thief's Assistant! Edgeworth: (So, I'm a thief's assistant now...?) Kay: Alright! Let's get going! The Great Thief Yatagarasu takes flight once again! Kay: Here we are! The scene of the crime! Let's get to work! Now, say it with me, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hm? Say what? Kay: \"Even in the depths of night...\" Edgeworth: .......... Kay: Aww, come on! Say the rest with me! Edgeworth: And just why should I do that!? Kay: Because! The Great Thief Yatagarasu has arrived on the scene! If we don't say the introduction, it just doesn't feel right! Edgeworth: I have no intention of becoming a thief. Kay: Aargh! Fine, then. I'll do it by myself! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: Yes, Kay. I know you are. I, on the other hand, am starting the investigation. Kay: Tch. You're no fun. Edgeworth: ...We don't have time for \"fun\". We only have until 2 o'clock. We need to begin making inquiries immediately. Kay: Good thing we have a photo, so we can go right ahead and start asking around! (Examining trailer after clearing all \"Talk\" options of Powers, blue truck, taxi, and film equipment and talking with officer leads to:) Edgeworth: (Hmm. It's already half past 12...) Kay: I wonder how Ms. Gravelle and the others are holding up... Edgeworth: How long will they be able to prolong the trial...? Kay: We gotta hurry and find Shaun! Edgeworth: Indeed. Lotta: Aww heck naw! That ain't how it's done! Ya ain't gonna catch a scoop like that! Nicole: S-Sorry, Chief! Lotta: What am I always tellin' ya!? We're beasts! Scoop-eatin' animals! It's scoop or starve! No story, no glory! Ya gotta get fired up! Nicole: Yessir! As expected of my mentor! Edgeworth: They're here... (It's those noisy reporters.) Kay: Hey, they came here too! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go talk to them! Edgeworth: ...Good grief. If we must. Edgeworth: What if the kidnappers stole the box? Kay: Ah! You mean they...! Edgeworth: Exactly. They took it in order to carry Shaun inside it. Kay: Shaun's a tiny kid, after all. Then, the reason the taxi driver didn't see Shaun was because... Edgeworth: It's likely he was put in the trunk as the kidnapper's luggage. Kay: But, why did they need to go through all the trouble of hiding him? Edgeworth: At first, the kidnappers must have intended to abduct him without being seen. However, they didn't anticipate all the policemen in the plaza. Kay: Ah, I see. If they tried to just walk away with him, they would've been spotted... Edgeworth: Just the mere presence of policemen would have been a sizable threat. Kay: I geddit! In that case, we've gotta ask the taxi driver! Edgeworth: Did the two men you told us about earlier have any luggage with them? Driver: Yeah. They stuffed a huge box into the trunk. Kay: Then that's that! Those guys must be the kidnappers! Edgeworth: Do you remember where you took those men? Driver: Sounds to me like something serious has gone down here... If you'd like, I could take you to the same place I took them. Kay: Let's do it, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes. Thank you for your help. Driver: No problemo! Just leave it to me! Kay: Uugh... That taxi drove way too fast. I don't feel too good. Edgeworth: ........ Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, are you alright? Your face is really pale. Edgeworth: I-I'm fine. The driver said they came to this house's garage... Kay: This must be where those two men brought the box! ...Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Look at the nameplate on the door! Edgeworth: Nameplate...? What!? \"Blaise Debeste\"!? Kay: So this is... the chairman's house! Edgeworth: (Does that mean the one who kidnapped Shaun was Blaise Debeste? Blaise should have already been arrested though...) Kay: Ah! The garage door is unlocked! Edgeworth: You really do have a good eye for this sort of thing... Edgeworth: (It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.) Kay: Excuse me... we're coming in... Anybody home? Edgeworth: Doing something like this, it's as if we're a couple of petty thieves...! Kay: Shh! Be quiet! Right now, we're Great Thieves! Have some self-awareness! Edgeworth: (...She scolded me.) Nobody's here... For now, it looks like we can get through this without being arrested. Kay: This isn't the time to be relieved! Now the real deal begins! Let's go look for treasure! Edgeworth: (We are looking for Shaun, not treasure...) (Examining the \"Cement bag\", \"Shovel and sledgehammer\", \"Gloves\" and \"Green box\" leads to:) ???: ...*thump, thump*... Edgeworth: Hm? Kay: Th-There's someone inside! ???: ...*thump, thump*... *thump, thump*... *CRASH*! Edgeworth: Is it... Shaun...? Kay: Shaun! We're coming to save you! ......Eh? Edgeworth: (Th-This is...!) You're..... S-Sebastian! Kay: Whaaaaat!? Why!? Debeste: Nnnnf, Nmmnnnmmf! Kay: This is Blaise's house, right? That would mean... Edgeworth: Yes. It should also be Sebastian's house. (So then, why is he...?) Kay, go help him out. Kay: If it has to do with ropes, just leave it to Kay! Here I go! A little pull over here, and a quick tug over there! Are you alright, Sebastian? Debeste: .......... Edgeworth: (He looks a little worse for wear.) Why were you tied up in a place like this? Debeste: .....How should I know!? Y-You guys don't know anything about me! Edgeworth: .....It's because we don't know. That's why we're asking you... Debeste: .......... Kay: He's completely shut off his heart... Edgeworth: Indeed... If it's come to this... ...I suppose I have no choice but to use that. Kay: Ah! You mean! Edgeworth: I hate to do this when he's in such a fragile state. It's like kicking a man who's down... Kay: ...Will it be alright? His mind might break if you corner him too much, y'know? Edgeworth: Yes. I am aware of that. I will try to be careful. (Good grief. I wonder how this will turn out... I've never held back against anyone before...) Edgeworth: After running out of the meeting room this morning, why would he be here of all places...? Debeste: You guys... You don't know how I feel! Edgeworth: (He's gone through a lot of shock. He must be on the verge of an emotional meltdown.) It can't be helped... At times like this, I must quietly listen to what he has to say. Debeste: N-No one tells me anything... I'm always the only one being left out like an idiot...! Edgeworth: (Hmm... I should try to answer his questions as best as I can.) Considering how fragile he is... I won't have much time to spare. I'll need to ask about his true feelings, and try to calm him down posthaste! Edgeworth: Could you please tell me what's on your mind? Debeste: I... I don't wanna! It's not like you'd listen to me anyways! Edgeworth: ..... Debeste: Wh-What's wrong? Normally, you'd be shouting \"Objection!\" right about now! Edgeworth: ..... Debeste: ...You're serious? Y-You're really... gonna listen to what I have to say? Edgeworth: I can understand... the shock you went through after what happened with your father. Debeste: It wasn't just Pops. This morning, I... I lost everything! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: E-Everything I have... was given to me by Pops... T-Tell me, Mr. Edgeworth... Just what am I supposed to believe in...? Edgeworth: If you can't believe in others, then at least believe in yourself. You'll need to gain experience on your own, but if you require wisdom, I can lend you a hand. Debeste: ! ...Ever since I got locked up, I've been thinking... ...am I too inculpable to be a prosecutor... uh? Incapable...? Erm, which one was it? Edgeworth: I believe \"incapable\" is the word you are looking for. Judging your own ability is not an easy task. Sebastian. Little by little, you are growing. Debeste: ! Edgeworth: Sebastian. Would you tell me your side of the story? Debeste: .....I-I understand. What... should I talk about? Edgeworth: Hmm. He seems to have calmed down slightly. I'd like you to tell me everything you know about the kidnappers. Now then... Tell me what you heard and saw! Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: Kidnapping his own son in order to demand a ransom wouldn't make such sense. Debeste: .....Y-Yeah, you're right! Edgeworth: Did you notice anything strange when you got kidnapped? Debeste: Oooh... As soon as I answered their question, they just took me away... Edgeworth: They asked you a question...? Tell me what they asked you! Debeste: Waaah! D-Don't glare at me like that... Erm... I think they asked me, \"Do you know Gravelle?\" Edgeworth: ! I see.. The pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall into place. Blaise... and the kidnappers did not intend to kidnap you. Their objective was Shaun Fenn. They were planning to kidnap Judge Gravelle's son... ...in order to have Fifi Laguarde declared not guilty! Debeste: J-Verity has a son...? And Warden Laguarde gets declared not guilty...? Edgeworth: I suspect... the kidnappers mistook you for Shaun Fenn. Debeste: A-All of this... was just a mistake? ! Wait... maybe that's why, back then...! Edgeworth: Hm...? Did you just remember something? Debeste: N-No..... It's nothing! I'm useless anyways... Just... leave me alone already! Edgeworth: Th-This is bad! He might be at his emotional limit...! I must get him to tell me what he remembered, and try to calm him down as well. Based on how distressed Sebastian looks right now... ...it must have been quite traumatic. I'll need to help him get back on his feet! Edgeworth: What did you remember just now? Debeste: I-I didn't remember anything... about Po... that guy... Edgeworth: Would \"that guy\" happen to be Blaise? Debeste: D-Darniiiiiit! Oooh... So this is the difference between me and someone who earned his Prosecutor title... Edgeworth: ...I've been waiting to ask you: Why did you become a prosecutor? Debeste: What does it matter!? I'm not fit to be a prosecutor anyways! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: S-Say something! Edgeworth: You must have some reason for choosing this path, right? Debeste: ...N-No, it's not like that! It wasn't anything special! I became a prosecutor for a really insignificant reason! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: It was just... a personal reason. Edgeworth: Heh... Just like you, I, too, became a prosecutor for a personal reason. Debeste: Huh...? I-Is that true...? B-But... you're a really successful prosecutor... I'm sure that Pops... the P.I.C. chairman... would have been more proud of you than me. Edgeworth: I see... so, you wanted your father's approval. Debeste: Ooh.....! I thought that if I became the best prosecutor, he'd be proud of me! That's why I...! I just wanted to help out Pops as much as I could......! Edgeworth: Would you... happen to be protecting your father? Debeste: Wha... I-I don't have any reason to protect someone like him...! Edgeworth: Didn't you want to help out your father... as much as you could? Debeste: Uuuuuunngh... Just once... I only wanted to be useful to Pops just this once! That way... I could help him regain his repetition! Edgeworth: You seem to be mixing up your words again... The word you're looking for is \"reputation\". Debeste: Huh? N-No one's ever told me that before! Edgeworth: Your father, who has strayed from his path, continues to add to his crimes... Even knowing that, do you truly want things to stay the way they are? Debeste: But... in that case, just what am I supposed to do? Edgeworth: You should triumph over your father, who has treated you like a fool. You must stop Blaise before he commits another crime! Debeste: ! I never thought of it that way. I... I want to triumph over Pops! Edgeworth: ...Somehow, it seems he has calmed down once again. Now's my chance to ask him about Blaise's secret! I will give Sebastian the courage to stand up to his father! Edgeworth: Hmm... He seems to have become unsettled again. I suppose I should lend him a hand... Edgeworth: The place you thought would be the safest... Would that have been in Blaise Debeste's hands? Debeste: Ungh... Waaaaaahhh! H-He told me that it would be safer if he took care of the evidence! Edgeworth: I'm sorry... but he has betrayed your trust in the worst way possible. Debeste: Pops... why would he want to hide the evidence...? Edgeworth: Blaise's objective was to have Warden Laguarde found not guilty, by obscuring the truth... Sebastian. You... were used by your father! Debeste: Ungh... Uwaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: It's possible that Blaise Debeste has the evidence with him. Furthermore, we still have no idea where Shaun is. I must return to my investigation posthaste, however... Debeste: This... This is all my fault...! What am I gonna do now...!? Edgeworth: ...Seeing him like this, I can't just leave him be. He is still suffering in the gap between his ideal and reality. He will never move on until he figures out how to live his own life! Sebastian is about to face his greatest trial. Perhaps this is fate. I shall give him the push forward that he needs. Edgeworth: For goodness' sake... Don't you remember your own words? Perhaps his \"own will\" can show him the way. Edgeworth: As a prosecutor... didn't you want to walk a different path from your father? Certainly, the path you have chosen is not an easy one. Nevertheless, you still chose to live as a prosecutor. In that case, it should be clear to you what you need to do...! Debeste: ! Edgeworth: ...I still question how I live my life to this day. But you, Sebastian... have found your own answer. So believe in yourself, Prosecutor Debeste! Debeste: I... WAAAAAAAAAAH! Edgeworth: (He was mistaken for Shaun, and kidnapped by Blaise's underlings. And after his father stole his evidence, he lost his confidence as a prosecutor... The emotions he is going through must be more painful than anything I could imagine.) It's taken longer than I thought... but with that, it's checkmate. Debeste: U-unh, uugh... ungh...! D... D-D-D-D... DARN IIIIIIIIIIIT! Edgeworth: .......... Kay: H-He dashed out of here at full speed... Edgeworth: (It seems if there's one thing he's \"the best\" at, it's running away...) Edgeworth: (Curses! We're running out of time...) We should check in with Mr. Shields. (I'd also like to know what the situation is like on their end.) Kay: But Mr. Debeste ran off again... Edgeworth: We'll just give them the new information we discovered. Franziska will take his place. Kay: Hmm... I wonder if that's going to be enough... Edgeworth: It can't be helped. Since he ran away, there's nothing more we can do. District Court - Courtroom No. 3 Ray: Eerm. I guess I'll just say it again. If there's no murder weapon, you can't prove the defendant is guilty. Franziska: Franziska: Just because we don't have the murder weapon, doesn't mean the defendant is innocent! It seems you wish to taste the sting of my whip. Ray: Gyaaah! Laguarde: Mr. Attorney. This trial... How much longer will it take? Because it feels like it hasn't gone anywhere at all for a good while now! Ray: Well, sorry, but that stubborn prosecutor over there just doesn't seem to understand. Franziska: Until I am satisfied... ...this whip will lash out at you as many times as I see fit. Ray: (By now, she's probably whipped me once for every year I've been alive... Miles... What's taking you so long? Even though we're just stalling for time, Uncle Ray can't keep this up much longer!) Whoops, 'scuse me. Phone call. Mind if I take this? Gravelle: ...I will allow it. Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. Ray: Oh, Miles, it's you. How's it going over there? Edgeworth: We found Sebastian. Ray: Oh! And the knife and chisel? Edgeworth: It seems he handed the evidence over to Blaise Debeste. It's very likely that Blaise knows the whereabouts of the murder weapon. Ray: Ex-chairman Debeste!? But, why would Blaise...? Edgeworth: That, I don't know yet. However, there may be some hidden connection between... ...Fifi Laguarde and Blaise. Ray: Gotcha. In that case, I'll issue a subpoena for Blaise Debeste right away. Edgeworth: ! Ray: I'll grill him personally. Edgeworth: I will continue to search for the missing evidence. (And for Shaun, as well...) Ray: Try to hurry it up, would ya? We're at our wits end over here! It feels like the verdict could be handed down at any moment! Edgeworth: Understood. (How much longer can Judge Gravelle's heart hold out? I know she's in a lot of pain... I've got to hurry.) Outside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza Kay: So? How's the trial going? Edgeworth: Blaise will be taking the stand. I don't know how things will turn out, though. Kay: He'll do anything, from hiding evidence to kidnapping... He really is nothing but trouble. Edgeworth: I agree. We should probably take another look at the evidence concerning him. Kay: OK! Leave it to me! First, here's the latest evidence fresh from the scene! Edgeworth: They're... the gloves from earlier. Although I am certainly curious about them... Anything else? Kay: The case files from the IS-7 Incident. If I recall, Blaise was also involved in this, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. He was involved in destroying the evidence. For now, let's keep this on hand. IS-7 Incident Documents jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Now then... is there anything else? Kay: Of course! Last but not least... We've got this! Edgeworth: This is... the Yatagarasu's badge. ...Kay. I'm talking about things related to Blaise. Please be serious. Kay: But aren't you always going around presenting random evidence too, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Gah...! No... W-Well... That's... Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?) Kay: Ah! What're you doing here? Debeste: WHOOOOOOOAAAHH! Kay: H-He ignored us... Edgeworth: (He came out of the Grand Tower... What was he doing in there?) Kay: Let's go investigate what Mr. Debeste was up to! Edgeworth: Yes... Let us go. Grand Tower - Rooftop Edgeworth: Hm? (The hatch is open...) Kay: It might be Mr. Debeste who opened it! Grand Tower - 51st Floor Storeroom Edgeworth: (Did Sebastian come in here...?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Over there! The safe's open! Edgeworth: (Did he come here to open that? ...Let's examine it thoroughly.) Kay: There's something inside the safe! Edgeworth: Let's go ahead and have a look. There are some documents in here... Kay: Hmm... it's just a bunch of papers and... huh? There's a photo here too. Edgeworth: Hm? This is a picture of...! Kay: Huh!? Th-That's Mr. Knightley! Knightley: ...Horace Knightley. The president's bodyguard. Kay: Why is his picture here? And what are all of these papers for!? Edgeworth: I don't know... We will have to read the documents to find out. I'm all but certain there is a connection between Knightley and Kanis. Kanis's chess partner, whose identity remained unknown until now... ...was actually Knightley all along. That is proof enough. Tomorrow, I shall interrogate him in the warden's office. I'll get him to confess that he's one of Kanis's henchmen. That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago... ...you simply must retrieve it. Edgeworth: This... seems to be a report about Knightley. Kay: Not to mention, it was apparently written before Knightley was killed...! Edgeworth: (Horace Knightley was murdered while he was being interrogated in the warden's office...) Judging from the contents, this document was probably written by Fifi Laguarde. Kay: I knew it! Edgeworth: The question, however, is who this report was addressed to. Kay: Ah! The owner of this safe is...! Edgeworth: The Conductor... Blaise Debeste. Kay: So, this proves that Ms. Laguarde and Blaise are connected! Edgeworth: Indeed. However, it's not just the two of them. Kay: Huh? Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste and Fifi Laguarde were searching for Kanis's henchmen. Kay: Bodhidharma Kanis! That dog-loving assassin! Edgeworth: This means that there is a hidden connection between the three of them. Kay: I wonder what it could be? Edgeworth: I don't know, but it must be related to this case. Report on Knightley jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Ah! There's some other stuff in here that I remember seeing! Edgeworth: Hm? There's something on his finger. Kay: Let's have a closer look! Oh! It looks like an expensive ring! Edgeworth: Don't steal it. Kay: Wha...! I didn't do anything yet! Edgeworth: It's Horace Knightley's... The chessboard and the ring... All of his possessions are inside this safe. Kay: So basically, all of this stuff is evidence from the prison case? Edgeworth: Correct. Kay: Then, the knife and chisel that vanished might be in here too! Let's see. Mr. Knife... Mr. Chisel... Hmm. They're not in there... I guess this is all just Mr. Knightley's stuff. Edgeworth: I see... That's too bad. (Horace Knightley... is dead.) Knightley: EEEEEDGEWOOOOOORTH!!! This game isn't over yet! You hear me! I...! I...! Edgeworth: (However, the game is not over yet... ...unless I can see it through to its end!) Knightley's Mementos data jotted down in my Organizer. Grand Tower - Rooftop ???: Young lady, good sir. ...Might I interest you in some cotton candy? Edgeworth: Hm? ???: There is also ice cream, if that is what you'd prefer? Edgeworth: Y-You! Sh-Shelly de Killer! de Killer: It's good to see you are well, Mr. Edgeworth. Kay: Wh-What are you doing in a place like this!? de Killer: As you can see, I am selling cotton candy. Would you care for some \"Heavenly Cotton Candy\"? Even sweeter than death. One bite will send you straight to heaven. Edgeworth: (That's definitely not something I'd want to buy from De Killer.) de Killer: The meaning of my message... Have you understood it? de Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Edgeworth: Have you been spying on us this whole time? de Killer: Spying? Heavens no. I was simply watching over you... ...while disguised as a cotton candy salesman. Edgeworth: (Isn't that the exact same thing!? What is this man's objective?) Were you the one... who murdered the president? de Killer: No. The contact with my client has already expired. ...President Huang is a bit of a celebrity in the world of assassins, you see. Over the years, many attempts on his life were made, and yet, he stubbornly lives on. He is a robust man, surrounded by flawless security. He even employs body doubles. Edgeworth: (Robust... That president? Rotund seems more apt.) ...However, it seems this time the president's security wasn't exactly flawless. Kay: Mr. Rooke had only just prevented your previous assassination, but this time...! de Killer: I did not kill him. It is not my principle to kill needlessly. I am also grateful to Rooke, a worthy adversary who was connected to me by fate. Thanks to that man, I did not kill a target who had no value to be killed. Edgeworth: (\"Thanks\" to Rooke preventing the assassination... What does he mean?) de Killer: My client deliberately gave me a false target. ...It was a betrayal most foul. I am now searching for my client. In all likelihood... ...it is the same person you are looking for. Edgeworth: (Is he saying that his client murdered the president?) Just who is this person you are referring to...? de Killer: I, myself, am not allowed to say. It would be a violation of the rules. I cannot disclose the identity of my clients. For to do so would create a problem of trust with my other clients. This is precisely why I am personally searching for them myself. Kay: What are you going to do when you find your client? de Killer: Of course... they shall be rewarded with a punishment most befitting of a traitor. Kay: Whaaaa!? That person... Wh-What'll happen to them? de Killer: ...I will leave that up to your imagination. Edgeworth: (It certainly won't be anything pleasant...) de Killer: Oh, yes... I will tell you just one more thing. Three days ago, Bodhidharma Kanis escaped from prison. Edgeworth: What!? de Killer: Three nights past, Kanis's solitary cell was found vacant. It was almost as if he knew I would come pay a visit. Edgeworth: (He visited Kanis's cell? Could it be, that the person De Killer is searching for is...) de Killer: Well then, if you'll excuse me, I must get going. Let us both do our best in tracking down that person... Edgeworth: (So, De Killer and Kanis. These two assassins...) Outside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza Edgeworth: (Hmm. This sound is...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Judge Gravelle's cellphone is ringing! Edgeworth: (Could it be Shaun?) ???: Mr. Edgeworth. How are you doing? Edgeworth: (It sounds like they're using a voice changer...) Who is this? ???: Someone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood... Edgeworth: (The red hood?) ...Are you the person who ambushed Kay? ???: Brilliant deduction! I'd expect no less from a prodigy prosecutor such as yourself! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I wanna listen in on this too! Edgeworth: Very well. (I'll put it on speaker...) ???: Well, I must say that I didn't expect the girl to get amnesia. Kay: Hey! What's that supposed to mean!? ???: But that's not all, y'see. Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane. Edgeworth: What!? (This must be the person De Killer spoke of...!) ???: I really should thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: You have no reason to thank me! ???: Oh, you haven't noticed? My, that's troublesome, y'know. I wanted you to catch Blaise for me... ...so I took dear little Kay. Edgeworth: What? ???: If Kay was suspected, I knew you would investigate the case. And I was sure that the great Miles Edgeworth would be able to catch Blaise! It was according to my plan! And y'know, I get the feeling that you have the wrong idea, so let me clear something up. Blaise Debeste wasn't the one who kidnapped Ms. Gravelle's son. Edgeworth: ! You... Why do you know about the kidnapping? ???: You and Ms. Gravelle are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you... Edgeworth: (How could this person know something like that...? Judge Gravelle was supposed to have visited me using the detective's name...) ???: I bet you're wondering how I knew about the kidnapping, right? It's quite simple, really! It's because darling little Shaun is in my care right now. Edgeworth: What!? Kay: Huh!? ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Quickly, little Kay! You have to hurry and steal him back! You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you? Kay: You even know it's my first job!? Edgeworth: (Why does this person know everything in so much detail?) ???: Well... I suppose I can't blame you for your mistake. It seems Blaise was after Shaun as well, y'see. Edgeworth: (So there were two kidnappings...) ???: He's such a fool, y'know. Kidnapping his own son instead! Edgeworth: Is Shaun there with you? If he is, then I would like to hear his voice. ???: Hmm. He's here, but I'm afraid I can't do that. Y'see, he's asleep right now. Edgeworth: In that case, there's no way for us to know if you really kidnapped Shaun or not. ???: ...Hmph. I suppose you don't have to believe me if you don't want to. Edgeworth: What is your objective? Is it to get Fifi Laguarde declared not guilty? ???: A not guilty verdict, eh... I couldn't care less about that. Edgeworth: (So his objective is different from Blaise's?) ???: ...I think I'll keep my objective a secret for now. Well then, I must be going. I hope you enjoy yourself, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Don't think you can get away with this. ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: Ngh...! Kay: Who in the world was that...? Edgeworth: I don't know. We don't have enough information. Kay: Darn it! We're totally clueless! Meanwhile, they seem to know everything about us! Edgeworth: ! (Know everything about us...?) Kay, you're right. Thinking about it, it is strange. How does the culprit know so much about us? Kay: It's so weird! I mean they even know about the kidnapping! Edgeworth: We must figure out how the culprit was able to obtain that information. (I must recall... What exactly did that person know?) ???: You and Ms. Gravelle are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you... ???: You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you? Kay: You even know it's my first job!? ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Edgeworth: (That's it! By analyzing our conversation with the culprit...!) I've figured it out, Kay. I know the source of this person's information! Kay: What!? Really!? Edgeworth: In all likelihood, this person probably... Edgeworth: I believe it is highly likely that we have been bugged. Kay: B-Bugged!? Edgeworth: If you recall what that person said... ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Edgeworth: If they couldn't see our faces, that means they weren't talking our pictures or following us. Kay: Th-Then, they must've planted a bug somewhere! Could it be in my stuff...? Edgeworth: (Was there anything they could have had a chance to bug...? There must be a hint somewhere in our conversation just now... That's right... that person knew something they shouldn't have. The conversation between Judge Gravelle and myself in the visitor's room...) Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! Gravelle: Hush. Please, have a seat. Edgeworth: (The only evidence I had with me at the time was...!) Where was the bug planted...? Edgeworth: Kay. May I see your badge? Kay: My Yatagarasu's badge? No way! Edgeworth: Wh-Why not...? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, just because you became a Great Thief's assistant... ...doesn't mean you're ready to wear this badge yet! Edgeworth: That's not it! It's very likely that a bug was planted in it. Kay: Whaaat!? In my badge? Edgeworth: Let's take a closer look. Kay: Ah! This is...! Edgeworth: It seems I was right. Yatagarasu's Badge data updated in my Organizer. Kay: How did you know? Edgeworth: The person had been in contact with you. Kay: You mean, when I was knocked unconscious. Edgeworth: Yes. That's why I thought one of your possessions might have been bugged. However, that person also overheard my conversation with Judge Gravelle. Even though that conversation took place in the visitor's room with just the two of us... Kay: Ah, so you were holding onto it at that time... Edgeworth: Exactly. All the other evidence had been taken away from me... Only the Yatagarasu's badge remained with me. Kay: So this creep's been listening in on us the whole time! Edgeworth: Indeed. That must be how they knew about all the information we collected. Kay: Does that mean... they're also listening in on this conversation? Edgeworth: Most likely. Kay: Hey, buster! Edgeworth: K-Kay... Kay: Eavesdropping is for cowards! Why don't you come out here and fight us fair and square!? Edgeworth: (Hm? What was that sound just now?) Nicole: Owwwwwwww... Kay: Huh? That's... Nicole! Nicole: Honestly, y'all scared the bejeezus out of me! Your voice was so loud there, Lil' Missy... I was so surprised I done fell flat on my behind! Kay: I-I'm sorry...! Nicole: What were ya gettin' so riled up for? Kay: You gotta hear this! It really grinds my gears! Nicole: Yes, yes? Edgeworth: ...Kay. Please just leave it at that. Unless you want to make tomorrow morning's headlines. Kay: Ah! That was close... Nicole: Aww, shucks. Don't be such a stick in the mud... What's wrong with lettin' a gal open her heart and spill the beans? Edgeworth: (For now, I'll turn the bug off.) Bug data jotted down in my Organizer. Nicole: So... did ya find the kidnappers? Edgeworth: Ms. Swift. Was the boy you saw being kidnapped... ...this boy in the photo? Nicole: Hmm? Nope, they ain't nothin' alike. He had a more stupid-lookin' face, and was wearin' a collared school uniform... Kay: I thought so... Edgeworth: (Yet again, we were led astray by this woman's testimony...) We will have to conduct our investigation all over again. So, we're back where we started. Are there any new leads...? (There's only 20 minutes left until 2 o'clock! Will we be able to make it in time...?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Mr. Edgeworth! About that phone call just now... Wasn't there a strange sound at the end? Edgeworth: A strange sound...? Edgeworth: Don't think you can get away with this. ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: Now that you mention it... It sounded like an explosion (Sound of an explosion - Sound of an explosion was heard during the call from the kidnapper.). It might be a hint to establish the culprit's whereabouts... Nicole: Mm-hmm. I see, I see. The sound of an explosion, eh? Edgeworth: Hmph! I would appreciate it if you stopped eavesdropping on us! Nicole: Mr. Prosecutor... Yer as stingy as ever. Edgeworth: (...First, let's see what she has to say...) (Clearing all \"Talk\" options of Nicole leads to:) Nicole's Tape Recorder data jotted down in my Organizer. ???: Mr. Edgewooooorth! Edgeworth: Mr. Saint, Ms. Berry! Simeon: D-Did you find him? Kay: Not yet. Just where could Shaun be...? Simeon: Shaun? Kay: Ah! No, no! It's nothing! Don't worry about it. Edgeworth: (They don't know anything about the kidnapping.) Regarding Sebastian, we found him not too long ago. Simeon: Really!? That's great! Thank you so much! Now I won't be arrested again. Edgeworth: Based on the explosion sound we heard from the kidnapper's phone... ...we know that Shaun is being confined some place in the vicinity of the Coliseum. Kay: One of the garbage dumps is right next to the Coliseum! Edgeworth: Shaun was almost certainly taken there. In which case... the place he is being confined to must also be somewhere close by. Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Could I ask you to search the area around this garbage dump? Gumshoe: .....You don't have to ask me like we're strangers, sir! It feels... so distant. ...Please just order me around like you normally do. Edgeworth: Are you sure, Detective? Right now I'm not a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Didn't I tell you, sir? Detectives don't just investigate for the sake of prosecutors! Edgeworth: ...You have my thanks, Detective. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth. Look. It's almost time...! Edgeworth: Yes. It would be best if we hurry. They should also be at their limit. Detective Gumshoe, I'm counting on you! Gumshoe: Leave it to me, sir! This may be an unofficial investigation... ...but I'll call in all of my pals from the station to help! Kay: I'll help too! Stealing Shaun back is my job, after all! Edgeworth: I'll be returning to the courtroom. I might be able to draw out some more time. Kay: Oookay! Well then! Even in the depths of... night... Edgeworth: Hmm. The clock just struck 2...! We have to hurry! Gumshoe: Yessir! Kay: Aaah, my introduction! ...When no other bird dares to take fliiight... Blaise: Well, well, well. If it isn't former Prosecutor Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Blaise Debeste...!) Franziska: Witness! Face forward! We're not done talking yet! Blaise: Like I said, y'see. Why exactly would I have needed to help that person out, Your Honor? Blaise: Y'know, it's a crying shame. Having a beautiful woman declared guilty. Honestly, it brings tears to my eyes. But y'see, there's no reason for me to go out of my way to hide evidence just to save her. Franziska: Franziska: However, we still have the testimony of your son, Prosecutor Debeste! He testified that he handed the evidence over to you! Blaise: Hmm. Well, I haven't the slightest clue what he was talking about. I simply can't imagine why Sebastian would have said something like that, y'know. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What if there is evidence that shows your connection with Warden Laguarde? Blaise: Hm? And just what do you think you're doing, \"Former\" Prosecutor Edgeworth? I was under the impression that you were no longer in any position to stand in court? Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! How dare you barge into my prosecutor's bench... Edgeworth: Franziska. I'm sorry. I need you to lend me the bench for a little while. Franziska: Wh-What are you saying...!? Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! I've brought vital evidence related to this case. Your Honor, please allow me to testify! Gravelle: ........ Blaise: Hah hah hah! She'd never allow it! Ray: Ray: Gravelle-pie. Uncle Ray also asks that he be allowed to testify. There are no objections from the prosecution either, right? Franziska: .......... Understood. The prosecution also has no objections. Blaise: Blaise: There's no way you can allow something like this, y'know. Such high-handed methods... ...surely are enough to warrant being held in contempt of court. Wouldn't y'say, Gravelle? Gravelle: ........ Edgeworth: (Ngh! As long as Shaun is still in danger... ...Judge Gravelle cannot rule against the warden. I must convey to her somehow that the search for her son is progressing!) Judge Gravelle. I ask that you have faith in me and my assistant. Franziska: Now that you mention it, where exactly is she...? Edgeworth: She is currently out searching for the most important piece of evidence. Blaise: Blaise: It's a waste of time. There's no such evidence. Are you stalling for time? How disgraceful. Ray: Ray: Most important piece of evidence, huh? ...Gravelle-pie. I don't really know what that evidence is, but I think we should have faith in her. After all, even if she may not look like it, she's still the Great Thief Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: (Somehow... it seems that Mr. Shields understands.) Judge Gravelle! We've already determined the general location of that evidence. It's only a matter of time before she steals the evidence back. Gravelle: ! ......I understand. Then I shall give you special permission to testify. Edgeworth: ...Thank you, Your Honor. Blaise: This is ridiculous! Gravelle: This vital evidence that you have found... Please present it to the court! Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste and Fifi Laguarde are somehow connected. Allow me to present the evidence that proves it! (Which piece of evidence shows the relationship between Fifi Laguarde and Blaise Debeste?) Edgeworth: This document contains a detailed report regarding the interrogation of a certain man. Ray: A certain man? Edgeworth: That man being the late Horace Knightley. And, the one who interrogated him was the defendant in this trial, Fifi Laguarde. Ray: ! So that means, that was the interrogation where... Edgeworth: That's right... Fifi Laguarde murdered Knightley in the aftermath of the interrogation. And that very interrogation has been recorded in this written report! Gravelle: That... definitely sounds like vital evidence! Franziska: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. Just now, you referred to that document as a \"written report\". Now, just who in the world was that report written for? Edgeworth: I thought you might ask that, Franziska. And that's precisely what is most important about this report...! We found this document inside the safe in the storeroom on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower. Franziska: The 51st floor... The storeroom for the black market auction! Edgeworth: Indeed. And the Conductor of the auction was you, Blaise Debeste! Blaise: ............ Edgeworth: You received a report about the victim from Warden Laguarde! In the face of this evidence, can you still say you have no connection to this case? Blaise: ......In regards to that, I refuse to answer. Edgeworth: What? Blaise: It has yet to be proven in court that I was the Conductor of the black market auction. Edgeworth: Oh? Have you already forgotten the events of this morning? I believe I had already proved it back then, did I not? Blaise: I will not deny that I was bested by you. However, that was at the crime scene. Who knows if the results will be the same in court. An acquittal is still possible, y'see. ...Until it's been proven in court that I am the Conductor of the black market auctions... ...you can't prove that document was addressed to me. Edgeworth: Your logic is twisted...! Blaise: That's not very nice, y'know. My logic isn't twisted, is it? Gravelle? Don't you feel the same way? It was quite unlike you to allow Former Prosecutor Edgeworth's statement just now, y'know. ...It saddens me, y'see. That you would fail to uphold the law as a judge should. In fact, I'm so upset by this, I may have no other choice but to use my last resort, y'know. Gravelle: .....I-It is as you say. Something that has not been proven in court does not merit any deliberation. I will have to... overrule... Mr. Edgeworth's claim. Edgeworth: (Ngh... As I thought, until Shaun has been rescued...) Blaise: Y'see? The truth at the scene and the truth in the courtroom are two very different things. Edgeworth: So, you're saying the truth can be distorted in court, as long as it's for your sake? Blaise: What a horrible thing to say. I'm not distorting the truth or anything like that, y'know. If a not guilty verdict is handed down, then that becomes the truth. That's all it is, y'see. Edgeworth: (It's useless. There's nothing we can do useless the missing evidence turns up...) Blaise: Now then, Gravelle. Why don't you deliver a Not Guilty verdict and let's get this over with? After all, that evidence... isn't gonna show up any time soon, y'know. ???: Gravelle: Wh-Who raised an objection just now? Debeste: ...P-Pops... Blaise: .....Sebastian. Debeste: ......Uugh. Blaise: Why did you come back here, now of all times? Gravelle: Sebastian! What is the meaning of this? Franziska: Just where were you and what have been doing since you abandoned your own trial? Debeste: I-I'm sorry. I was... umm... Franziska: Such an act is unbecoming of a prosecutor! You should be ashamed! Debeste: I... umm... well... Blaise: Sebastian. You still don't get it, y'know. This court has no place for sniveling child such as yourself! Debeste: .....Pops.....! I...... I...! I-I've come to present new evidence, Your Honor! So, so... please! Let me take my place back at the prosecutor's bench! Edgeworth: (Sebastian...! I didn't think he would come back...) Blaise: Blaise: Hah hah hah hah! What's all this now, Sebastian? You don't seem at all like your normal self! Debeste: ........Uugh. Pops... Blaise: Hm? Come now! What's the matter? You want Daddy to play with you? Is that it? Well then, why don't we just head on back home. Debeste: R-Return to the witness stand. Blaise: What's wrong? You're shaking like a leaf. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! The prosecutor officially in charge of this case has just arrived with new evidence. The trial is still in session. In light of this, shouldn't we continue with the proceedings? Gravelle: ........ Ray: Naturally, the defense has no objections, Your Honor. I'm sure the defense attorney originally in charge would say the same. Franziska: .....The prosecution has no objections, either, Your Honor. Gravelle: .......... Blaise: Continue with the proceedings? That won't be necessary. Isn't that right? Gravelle. Edgeworth: (Blaise still believes that he was the one who kidnapped Shaun. As long as Shaun still hasn't been found... ...Judge Gravelle will remain bound by Blaise, and nothing else will change that!) Gravelle: .......... Th-That sound is... Edgeworth: (Her cell phone...!) Hm...! (My phone as well...?) Ray: Eh? Uncle Ray's phone is also...! Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! Kay: Mr. Shields! Gumshoe: We've found Shaun, sir! Kay: We rescued Shaun! Edgeworth: Excellent work, Detective! Ray: That kid was the most important piece of evidence, right? Way to go, Kay! Kay: Eheheh! I wanted to spread the word quickly, so I had everyone call! Edgeworth: .....Judge Gravelle. It's for you. Gravelle: ..... Gravelle: .......Yes. I see. I'm..... I'm so glad you're safe...! Make sure you properly thank everyone. OK? ............Be careful, and come home safe. Gravelle: ...Let us resume the proceedings. Now that I may once again swing my gabel to my heart's content. Blaise: Hah...! You're kidding, right? This is just a sad joke, y'know! Gravelle: Witness! This is no joke! Please return to the stand! Prosecutor Debeste, as well. Promptly return to your seat at the prosecutor's bench! Debeste: Y-Yes, Your Honor! Franziska: ........Sebastian Debeste. Debeste: Y-Yes, Ms. von Karma...!? Franziska: .....I leave the rest to you. Debeste: Huh...? Franziska: \"Going up against your own father...\" It won't be easy. I shall observe how things pan out... from the gallery. Gravelle: Now then, allow me to ask once more... Is the prosecution ready? Prosecutor Debeste. What is this new evidence you wish to present...? Debeste: .....The missing knife and chisel, Your Honor. Ray: You mean they've finally been found!? Gravelle: Prosecutor Debeste! Is this true!? Debeste: ...Th-The knife and chisel... I wasn't able to find them... I searched and searched! I really did! But... it was already too late... Edgeworth: (Too late...?) Ray: What do you mean? Debeste: I remembered... This morning, when I passed by Pops in the garage at home... ...he was holding something wrapped in a newspaper. Debeste: Pops, where are you going? Blaise: Ah, Sebastian. Just taking out some trash. Debeste: At that moment, I heard it. .....The faint sound of a bell. Ray: Could that sound have been, by any chance... Edgeworth: ...the bell attached to Kanis's chisel!? Gravelle: In other words... you're saying that the witness threw away the evidence? Blaise: ........ Debeste: I searched for it, but I didn't make it in time. I'm sorry... Ray: Where exactly did you search for it? Debeste: The garbage dump! I went to the garbage dump and searched everywhere! I thought the evidence Pops threw away had to be there...! Edgeworth: Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?) Kay: Ah! What're you doing here? Debeste: WHOOOOOOOAAAHH! Kay: H-He ignored us... Edgeworth: (So at that time, he had gone to the garbage dump...) Debeste: But... but... ...this was all I could find. Gravelle: This is...? It smells rather peculiar... Ray: Now that you mention it, there's kind of a funky smell coming from you as well... Debeste: Wh-What do you expect!? I was digging through garbage! Edgeworth: And what of the knife? Debeste: I think it's buried somewhere in that giant mountain of trash... ...but I couldn't find it by myself. Gravelle: ...I understand. I shall accept this into evidence. Blaise: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Well done, Sebastian! You never betray my expectations, y'know! You searched so desperately through the garbage and that's all you have to show for it? Debeste: Urk...! Blaise: Awww, what a tear-jerker! I'm tearing up already! Ray: Ray: It's a bit too early for tears, don't you think? We haven't examined the evidence properly yet. Blaise: ...I think it's just a pointless waste of time, y'know. Ray: I'm counting on you. Sebastian, Miles. Show him that the truth can be exposed in court and take him down! Edgeworth: (Mr. Shields is backing us up. Now all we need is a breakthrough...!) Prosecutor Debeste. Let's take a closer look at the evidence. Debeste: R... Right! Edgeworth: Let's have a look inside. (It'd be great if we could find some kind of proof.) This is... the bell that was attached to Kanis's chisel... Are there any traces left behind on it? Debeste: .....Ack, it's no good. There's not even a single smudge on it... Gravelle: What did you find, Prosecutor Debeste!? Blaise: Did you even find anything? Debeste: D... Darn it... Blaise: Of course you'd find nothing. Something like that can't be called evidence, y'know. All it is, is trash. It may be sad, but that's the truth, y'see. Edgeworth: (Were Sebastian's efforts all for naught...?) Indeed, this bell does not seem to be valid evidence... (However...) Debeste: Mr. Edgeworth! Are you really giving up!? Blaise: Calm as always, Edgeworth. Quite unlike Sebastian here! Gravelle: ...Well then, is the prosecution finished with its argument? Debeste: Debeste: Verity, not yet! We're not through yet! There's still something we haven't examined! Blaise: You're still not giving up? Struggling in vain's not cute at all, y'know. Edgeworth: (It seems Sebastian hasn't given up yet either. I was just thinking the exact same thing. The last item remaining... Is it trash, or is it evidence...? If we don't examine it, we'll never find out... The item I'm thinking of is...) Debeste: We're still not done examining the newspaper that the bell was wrapped in! Edgeworth: (It seems that Sebastian has the same idea as I do.) Blaise: Wow, this is just wonderful, y'know. So wonderful, it's to cry for. Is it desperation, or simply reckless abandon? Are you really going to... pin all your hopes on a worthless scrap of newspaper? Edgeworth: Heh. We won't know for sure whether or not it's \"worthless\" until we examine it, will we? Sebastian. Let's examine it posthaste. Edgeworth: Is this... a handprint? Debeste: ! There's something greasy on here too... Is it oil? Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! We'd like to request a fingerprint analysis on this paper! Could you please summon someone from forensics? Gravelle: Your request is accepted. Contact the lab at once! Forensics: Reporting! These are definitely fingerprints! However... it's from a glove! Debeste: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? Blaise: Didn't I tell you? It's nothing but a worthless scrap of paper. Just thinking about it, y'know. When handling important evidence... ...what kind of idiot wouldn't use gloves!? Oh wait, wouldn't that be you? The idiot who doesn't know when to give up. Ray: ...That's pretty harsh, talking to your son like that. Blaise: What's wrong with calling an idiot an idiot? If you want to be The Best, you have to be heartless. I have no compassion worthless individuals, not even my own son! Debeste: Pops...! I.....! Blaise: Y'know, you've always called yourself a genius prosecutor, haven't you? Didn't I explain to you this morning why you were a genius up until now? That's right. It was all because of me. Because of my authority. You were always being protected. By people like Gravelle... and me. Debeste: ........Uuunghh. Blaise: Now, get that stinking face of yours out of my sight. Debeste: Stinking... Blaise: Y'know, now that I think about it, that stench might just suit you perfectly. Just keep it away from my nose, or my eyes will start watering. Debeste: Debeste: Wrong... You're wrong, Pops. Blaise: ...Sebastian? What are you talking about? Debeste: ...You're the one who stinks, Pops. It's you, not me! Blaise: What...? Debeste: ...You haven't noticed, have you? You smell, Pops. So much that you can't even hide it. Mr. Edgeworth... Try smelling the hand print on the newspaper. Edgeworth: The smell...? ...Hmm. It smells... like oil... Debeste: I know something that smells just like it... Edgeworth: (Come to think of it, back then...) Edgeworth: (It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.) Debeste: That's right... The smell proves it. It proves that the culprit who hid the evidence was...! It's no good... I guess I can't become the best after all. I'm too soft... I could never be so heartless... ...I just can't bring down my father with my own hands. Edgeworth: (Prosecutor Debeste...) ..........Summon... your courage. \"Become a different prosecutor from your father\"... Wasn't that what you decided? Debeste: ! Edgeworth: We are prosecutors. And as prosecutors, we stand in the courtroom. In that case, isn't it our duty to shed light on the truth? Debeste: ........ Edgeworth: Exposing crimes and bringing criminals to justice. Even if the criminal is your own father... ...that is your duty, as a prosecutor. Didn't I promise you? That if you have the courage to stand up... I will show you the way. And if you cannot do it alone, then we shall do it together... Debeste: ...Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Allow me to present the evidence that connects this hand print with my father! Edgeworth: This is the smell of motor oil. The kind used for maintaining motorcycles... Debeste: Both myself and Mr. Edgeworth have smelled this exact same smell before! Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste! It was in your garage! Blaise: ! Edgeworth: And wouldn't you say these fingerprints have a rather peculiar shape? The five letters that spell out D-E-A-T-H. It's exactly the same as your own gloves. Blaise: Blaise: Ha ha ha! You can buy gloves like that from anywhere! It doesn't prove a thing! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that really the case? Debeste: That's not the only thing that these two pieces of evidence have in common! Edgeworth: (The fingerprints on the newspaper that was used to wrap up the bell... ...and Blaise's mechanic's gloves...) This is the unmistakable similarity they both share! Edgeworth: If you examine the imprint left by the letter A, you'll see it's unmistakably from this glove. Blaise: Whaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: And that's not all... There is one more item we must take note of. Namely, these dirt stains. I suggest we do a comparative analysis of the dirt stains from the newspaper and the glove. If the contents match up... then it will prove to be decisive evidence. Gravelle: Bailiff! Please have these dirt samples sent to forensics for analysis immediately! Blaise: Gaaaaaaaarrgh! Edgewooorth! Sebastiaaaan! You lowly prosecutors! Do you have any idea who I am!? Debeste: Pops... you can't run away anymore. It's been proven in court that you concealed the evidence. And that you tried to cover for the defendant... Blaise: Y-You're saying that I'm... Guilty? That I'll be sent to prison...? Me, Blaise Debeste? A couple of snot-nosed punks are gonna make me disappear!? There must be some mistake! Debeste: Debeste: Be a man and admit your crimes! Blaise: Blaise: Do you really think you can survive if I'm not around? Debeste: I..... I'll be fine now. I thought I wanted to be the best prosecutor, so I could get your approval, Pops. But, when I was kidnapped by your men... and stuck in that dark room, I started thinking. \"I am... truly powerless.\" I despaired, and averted my eyes from the truth. But... ...at that moment, Mr. Edgeworth stepped in and showed me the way. And now, I am no longer just a child chasing after his father's approval! I've become capable... I can find evidence on my own now! Blaise: Wha... My men kidnapped you? Why were you...!? Debeste: Debeste: Pops, I'll show you the truth you never knew... through this trial. Blaise: Sebastiaaan! How dare you speak to me like that...! You should've just stayed as an idiot son! Debeste: You may have hated me to the very end, Pops... ...but I... I've always looked up to you. Thank you for everything up until now. .....And goodbye. Blaise: You... Since when did you... All you've ever been able to do was depend on me! SebaSTIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNN! Gravelle: It has been established that the evidence was concealed by Blaise Debeste himself. A judgment regarding his concealment of evidence shall be delivered at a separate trial. The missing chisel and knife still have yet to be found. However, once a search of the waste disposal site is underway, they will surely be discovered. Laguarde: ...The knife will be found? Wh-What will happen to me if it's found? Edgeworth: Heh. No need to worry. You'll simply receive the punishment you deserve for your crime. Laguarde: Grrrr! Punishment? For me!? Blaise, what in the world are you doing!? You! You... After all your boasting about being able to create your own truths and Not Guilty verdicts! That's why I contacted you immediately after the prison incident in the first place! And to make matters worse, you even kidnapped the wrong kid! I just can't believe this! You really, really, really are... completely useleeeeeessss! Edgeworth: ...That was certainly a violent outburst. But you heard her, Prosecutor Debeste. Debeste: Yeah. She got flustered and said a bunch of important stuff! ...Right? Edgeworth: Indeed... That's correct. (He still doesn't seem very sure of himself...) Gravelle: Very well. And with that, this court is adjourned. ???: Edgeworth: What? Franziska: Huh!? Gravelle: Wh-Who are you? Lang: Judge Gravelle. It's still too early for a happy ending. Lang Zi says: \"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case.\" Gravelle: And who... might you be? Lang: The name's Shi-Long Lang. I'm just a humble, lone investigator. Gravelle: Do you have some objection with this trial? Lang: Hah! Not a chance! The defendant there has a heart as black as a moonless night. Laguarde: Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...? Lang: You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree? Edgeworth: Agent Lang. What are you talking about? Lang: The SS-5 Incident from 12 years ago... It's a case I'll never forget. Edgeworth: (12 years ago...?) Lang: ......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa. Edgeworth: (12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?) Edgeworth: (Might it have something to do with Lang's father and President Huang?) Lang: Fifi Laguarde. And you, Blaise Debeste. Back then, the two of you killed off the Lang clan... Laguarde: Rrgh... Gravelle: Were you involved in the incident 12 years ago? Lang: That's right, I was. However... I'm not here to chase after ghosts of the past. I'm here for you, Verity Gravelle...! Gravelle: M... Me? Lang: You, and one other... Shaun: .......... Gravelle: Shaun! Lang: Ms. Gravelle! You're coming along too! As a suspect in the murder of the president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang! What evidence do you...!? Lang: Lang: Settle down, Mr. Prosecutor. The investigation has only just begun. We're going to inspect the crime scene with the suspects in attendance. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang... did he get his hands on some new pieces of evidence?) Lang: If you have any objections, then you can tag along as well. Edgeworth: ...I shall do just that. Shaun: ........ Edgeworth: (\"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case\"... There are still many mysteries yet unsolved surrounding the murder of the president... Namely, the true nature of the \"giant monster\", and...) ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: (The true identity of the person on the other end of the phone...) To be continued. \n-- Shaun's Rehearsal -- Shaun: I wasn't feeling too great during yesterday's shoot, so I made a few bloopers. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. You said you didn't feel well. Could you tell me more concretely what was wrong? Shaun: That doesn't matter! I just wasn't feeling well, alright!? Kay: You weren't feeling well... Maybe you drank too much milk? Shaun: Wha... How'd you...!? Ah, no, I mean, that's not it... Edgeworth: (So he didn't feel well because of his stomach...) Kay: When I was young, I was told that chewing milk makes it easier on your stomach, y'know? Shaun: Th-This conversation is over! Anyways, I made a few bloopers. Shaun: They're reshooting the scene today, so... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So they planned to reshoot the scene today. And you were practicing for that last night. Shaun: ...My mistakes caused a lot of trouble for the people around me. I'm a pro, so practicing that much more is natural. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He certainly does have an admirable sense of responsibility.) Penny: Shaun is incredibly dedicated to his craft. He didn't even make any major mistakes in those bloopers. But he said if it would make the movie just a tiny bit better... Shaun: Shut up! You don't need to go around blabbering about stupid stuff like that! Penny: Ah... I-I'm sorry. Edgeworth: (If only he was a little more cooperative, I'd have no complaints.) Shaun: Hmph... Anyway, that's what happened. Shaun: Well, I decided to rehearse a little on my own. That's all. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. About your testimony just now... Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Don't I always tell you!? If you're going to practice by yourself, you have to let me know beforehand! Shaun: I-I-I know! Edgeworth: (...My time to speak was completely stolen away from me.) I shall ask you once more. Shaun, about your testimony just now... Kay: But you know, Shaun, I think that's really great! Edgeworth: (Mmph... A-Again!?) Kay: I bet putting in an honest effort like that will make someone even more talented. You'll go from a little thief to a Middle Thief, and then someday you'll become a Great Thief! I'll be doing my best, so you do your best too! OK, Shaun? Edgeworth: ........Ahem. Now then, if I may? Shaun. Do you often rehearse in that way? (At last... At long last, I finally got to ask my question...!) Shaun: I do it all the time. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There are no mistakes in that testimony, correct? Shaun: O-Of course there's no mistakes! It was just a normal, peaceful night! Nothing out of the ordinary happened at all! Kay: A... A peaceful night!? How can you say that when an incident like this has occurred!? Edgeworth: Kay, he is still a child. Please don't get seriously angry. Present Moozilla's Head Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that? Shaun: ...! I don't know anything about it. Edgeworth: Is that true? Shaun: I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something? Edgeworth: (...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after Shaun had already gone back...) Shaun: If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We're not done talking yet! Shaun: What now? Edgeworth: The falling monster's head wasn't the only unusual thing that happened last night. And this is something you should be well aware of. What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling? Present Monster's Footprints or Shaun's Practice Video Edgeworth: Leads to: \"We have evidence right here.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. Take a look at this. Shaun: And what's that supposed to be? Edgeworth: Don't you understand? This shows what happened last night. Shaun: ...... Edgeworth: Hmph... Have I left you speechless? Shaun: ...You're so far off the mark that I have nothing to say. Edgeworth: Argh! (Was I really that far off...?) Kay: Let's review what happened here last night one more time! Edgeworth: Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer! Kay: Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night? Leads back to: \"What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling?\" Edgeworth: We have evidence right here. Shaun: Ah! Could that be...!? Edgeworth: That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance. Shaun: ........Ugh. Lang: What!? You're telling me you have video from last night!? Edgeworth: Exactly. And in this video... ...there is clearly something that is out of the ordinary. Lang: Th-This is... a monster's footprint...! Edgeworth: Would you say that monster's footprints are commonplace on a film set? Gravelle: Shaun... Why did you conceal this video from us? Shaun: ........No reason, really. Lang: Lang: Hey, pup! This is no joking matter! You had a reason to hide it, right? Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Answer him clearly! Shaun: But Mom..... Edgeworth: Well? Shaun: ...I didn't want anyone to see me rehearsing. Lang: ........ Kay: ........ Edgeworth: ........ In other words, you're embarrassed about others seeing you practice. Shaun: ...Yeah. Got a problem with that!? Lang: Lang: You're saying that's why you hid the evidence? Gravelle: Shaun! Shaun: Eep! ...Quit nagging me. You've already busted me, what more do you want? Yeah, the footprints were there, but I just practiced and headed home. Lotta: How come yer so calm after findin' those footprints!? It's a monster, ya know!? A real live monster! Shaun: ...I thought it was just a part of the set. Besides, there's lots of other weird stuff around here too. Nicole: He's suspicious, Chief! This kid's really suspicious! Lotta: Yer right! The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven! Shaun: ...Shut up. We're done talking! Lang: Leads to: \"Wait up...\" Present Monster's Footprints or Shaun's Practice Video Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? We have evidence right here. Shaun: Ah! Could that be...!? Edgeworth: That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance. Shaun: ........Ugh. Lang: What!? You're telling me you have video from last night!? Edgeworth: Exactly. And in this video... ...there is clearly something that is out of the ordinary. Lang: Th-This is... a monster's footprint...! Edgeworth: Would you say that monster's footprints are commonplace on a film set? Gravelle: Shaun... Why did you conceal this video from us? Shaun: ........No reason, really. Lang: Lang: Hey, pup! This is no joking matter! You had a reason to hide it, right? Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Answer him clearly! Shaun: But Mom..... Edgeworth: Well? Shaun: ...I didn't want anyone to see me rehearsing. Lang: ........ Kay: ........ Edgeworth: ........ In other words, you're embarrassed about others seeing you practice. Shaun: ...Yeah. Got a problem with that!? Lang: Lang: You're saying that's why you hid the evidence? Gravelle: Shaun! Shaun: Eep! ...Quit nagging me. You've already busted me, what more do you want? Yeah, the footprints were there, but I just practiced and headed home. Lotta: How come yer so calm after findin' those footprints!? It's a monster, ya know!? A real live monster! Shaun: ...I thought it was just a part of the set. Besides, there's lots of other weird stuff around here too. Nicole: He's suspicious, Chief! This kid's really suspicious! Lotta: Yer right! The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven! Shaun: ...Shut up. We're done talking! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We're not done here yet! Shaun: What now? Edgeworth: The monster's footprints weren't the only unusual things that happened last night. Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night? Present Moozilla's Head Edgeworth: Leads to: \"A monster's head fell from the roof of that building.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This shows what happened here yesterday. Shaun: ...And just what exactly does it show? Edgeworth: You don't understand, do you? You are still a child, after all. Shaun: I don't need some guy who's less intelligent than a child telling me that. Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (It seems that wasn't it...) Kay: Let's review what happened here last night one more time! Edgeworth: Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer! Kay: Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night? Leads back to: \"Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night?\" Edgeworth: A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that? Shaun: ...! I don't know anything about it. Edgeworth: Is that true? Shaun: I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something? Edgeworth: (...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after Shaun had already gone back...) Shaun: If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking! Edgeworth: (It seems that Shaun doesn't really want to talk about last night. Could he be hiding something after all...?) Leads to: \"Wait up...\" Edgeworth: So there was nothing out of the ordinary...? Kay: He doesn't know anything at all about the incident. That's the impression I'm getting. But isn't there evidence that shows something did happen last night? Edgeworth: Yes... I don't have time to waste dealing with a child's lies. Let's present the contradiction. Lang: Wait up... Edgeworth: ? Agent Lang? Lang: Heh heh heh. It's as I thought. Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. This video backs up my logic. Kay: Huh!? Is there something in the video that's related to the case? Lang: Yeah... Take a good, hard look at the monster costume in the top-left. Kay: The Moozilla costume...? Lang: Try comparing it with the one over there right now. Kay: Hmm? It looks like it's just hanging there limply though. And the zipper on its back is zipped up tightly. Edgeworth: (Zipper on its back...?) Wha! (Th-This discrepancy is...!) Lang: Yeah. The difference is plain to see. In the video, the zipper is clearly open! That's right... Someone was inside. Kay: WHAAAAAAAT! Edgeworth: Mr. Powers! Is the costume's zipper usually...? Powers: It's always zipped up tightly when it's not in use... Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. Do you remember? My logic from before... Lang: Two nights ago, Gravelle pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body. Edgeworth: In here? Lang: Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Edgeworth: You're saying the body... was hidden inside the costume? Lang: Yeah, that's right! Judge Gravelle! Two nights ago, you pushed the president off the roof of the tower. You then hid the body inside the monster costume! Gravelle: I... I did no such thing! Lang: Lang: Say what you want, but you're the only one who could've done it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That should have already been proven impossible. The film lot was locked at the time! Judge Gravelle could not have entered this place! Lang: Lang: ...And what if there was an accomplice? Edgeworth: What? Lang: I'll tell you my reasoning, so listen up. -- Mother and Son Theory -- Lang: When the president was pushed off the roof, Shaun was waiting at the film lot. If Shaun was an accomplice, the problem with the locks would be resolved. The two of them then hid the president's body. Inside that monster costume over there... Edgeworth: You think this crime had such an elaborate plan? Lang: To take the life of a nation's president. An elaborate plan is to be expected, don't you think? Gravelle: Gravelle: Shaun would never... take part in such a crime! Lang: Lang: You're the one being suspected. Your words don't carry much weight! Edgeworth: I wouldn't think those two had sufficient motive for something like this, though? Lang: Well, maybe they had a motive that we didn't know about? You were the last one to meet with the president. And you're still keeping the details secret. Don't you think it's only natural that you're being suspected? Gravelle: ...... Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Is there no way for you to tell us your secret. Gravelle: M-My apologies. I just cannot, no matter what... However, when the time I can talk about it comes, I will surely let you know. So, if you could please... Lang: Believe you? Is that what you wanted to say? That's what all criminals say. And you, pup... If you've got an explanation, hurry up and spit it out. Shaun: Hmph. I didn't do nothing. ...That's all I'm saying. Lang: Both mother and son won't talk. You still gonna defend 'em like this? Edgeworth: It's true, Judge Gravelle's actions are a mystery... ...however, we still don't know whether or not that ties in with a motive for murder. Lang: Yeah, that's right. Their motive for murder can wait. For now, let's talk about the situation surrounding the crime. ...And the fact that these two are the only ones who could've done it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang. Don't tell me you're saying Shaun was an accomplice? Kay: Shaun still looks like a grade school kid, he's even got a kiddy backpack to boot! How could he be an accomplice...? There's just no way! Penny: Like I said, Shaun's already in middle school, and the backpack is a part of his costume... Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says! \"No matter how young the cub, never pity an ungrateful pup.\" He may be a little brat, but a villain deserves no mercy. Kay: Uuuh... So Mr. Lang Zi didn't make any allowances for age... Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. You're not just defending him 'cause he's a pup, are you? Edgeworth: Hmph. Of course, that was never my intention. I shall present suitable evidence in due course. Lang: Oh? I'm looking forward to it. My logic's just getting started. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How would that... resolve the problem!? Lang: I figured you'd ask that, Mr. Prosecutor. But y'know, it's actually quite simple. Listen up... First, that woman pushes the president off the roof. Kay: Hmm... she pushes him off. Lang: Then, that brat, who knew the combination for the lock, unlocks the film lot. Kay: I see... the combination unlocks the brat! Edgeworth: Kay, it's the opposite. Lang: ...That's all it takes. With this, the problem of the lock is solved. Your theory that she couldn't get in because she didn't know the combination no longer files! Edgeworth: (Hmm... Regarding the lock, that certainly is a plausible explanation...) Agent Lang. Thank you for your clear explanation. Please, continue with what you were saying before. Lang: Hmph. If you're gonna give up, you better do it now. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Supposing those two were accomplices... Why would they have needed to leave the body hanging there for an entire day!? Lang: Lang: Why don't you give it a rest, and take a good hard look at reality. Thanks to their trickery, our investigation has been confused up until now. Doesn't that about answer your question!? ...Got it? Those two hid the body. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In the video, we cannot see the inside of the costume. So can you really say for certain that the body was placed inside? Lang: ...Yeah, I'll give you that much. In that case, why don't we try examining it? The inside of that costume! There might be some traces left inside. Edgeworth: Mr. Powers, may we examine the inside of the costume? Powers: Sure. Go ahead. But it might be kinda stinky, since I sweat a lot in here... Edgeworth: This is... incredibly dirty. Powers: That's strange... We always make sure to clean it after using it, so that the sweat doesn't damage the costume. Lang: Lang: Isn't this just proof that someone besides you used this costume? I'd say that dirt from the body probably got into the costume. Kay: The president's body did fall on top of the monster's footprint. That must be where the dirt came from! Lang: ...Are you satisfied now? Add statement: \"There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, dirt got into the costume when the body was hidden inside. Wouldn't that mean... ...that the dirt was transferred from the body? Lang: Hah! Isn't that obvious? How else would you say it got there? Kay: ...There's dirt stuck everywhere inside the costume. It looks particularly bad around the chest area. Edgeworth: (Dirt around the chest...? We cannot overlook this fact.) Kay: Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense... Edgeworth: Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point. Kay: In that case, what should we do? Edgeworth: Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail.

Present Crime Scene Notes Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it...\" Kay: Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense... Edgeworth: Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point. Kay: In that case, what should we do? Edgeworth: Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail. Let's draw out more information. Edgeworth: Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it... Is that really the case? Lang: You have a problem with that? Edgeworth: There is a fair amount of dirt inside the front of the costume. Kay: Yeah, that IS a lot of dirt... Edgeworth: However, I would like you to focus on the state the body is in. It's lying on top of the dirt, and yet there's no dirt on the front of the body. If the body really was inside the costume... ...then it's strange that the front of the body isn't stained with more dirt! Lang: Rrgh! Well then, how would you explain it? How did the dirt get inside the costume!? Edgeworth: (From the video footage, it's very likely that someone was inside the costume. But just who could it have been...?) Kay: Hmm... Where have I seen this? Edgeworth: What's the matter, Kay? Kay: I just feel like I remember seeing something that looked like this dirt somewhere before... ...but where was it? There were these bits of gray fragments mixed in with the dirt. Edgeworth: (Gray... fragments? There does seem to be something other than normal dirt mixed into it...) Kay: Something must've gotten stuck to it, and lots of it I might add. Hmm... Edgeworth: (Something got stuck to it? This may merit a closer look. Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?) Present Mechanic's Gloves Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is what you're thinking of, isn't it, Kay? Kay: Oh! Mr. Edgeworth, you sure are sharp! Edgeworth: Hmph... Naturally. Kay: ...But too bad! Not this time! Edgeworth: Argh! (You should have just said that in the first place!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, can't you remember? Dirt, dirt... Where else did we see this dirt? Edgeworth: (Dirt... Wasn't there a piece of evidence that had dirt on it?) Kay: It's on the tip of my brain, but I just can't quite place it. Where on earth have we seen dirt like this before? Leads back to: \"(Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?)\" Edgeworth: This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it. Lang: Huh? And what of it? Edgeworth: We found an item belonging to a certain man, that was covered in the same type of dirt. That is to say, these gloves. Lang: Those dirt stains... certainly look the same. But, tell me... Just what exactly is this grey substance!? Edgeworth: This grey substance is... Plastic Edgeworth: Yes, I believe it's plastic. Your thoughts? Lang: Lang: Hah! You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Prosecutor! Put more \"BANG!\" into your claims, like you usually do! Edgeworth: Ah... Hmm. Lang: As for my opinion on the matter... I'll tell you right now, that stuff is definitely not plastic! Edgeworth: Nngwaaah! (So that wasn't it...) Kay: Let's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it? Edgeworth: Right. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally. Leads back to: \"This grey substance is...\" Concrete Leads to: \"This grey substance must be fragments of concrete.\" Paint Edgeworth: No matter how you look at it, this must be paint! Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor! When did you become so scatterbrained!? No matter how you look at it, this doesn't look like paint! Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (I suppose not...) Kay: Let's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it? Edgeworth: Right. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally. Leads back to: \"This grey substance is...\" Edgeworth: This grey substance must be fragments of concrete. Kay: You mean... the stuff that was scattered around the monster's footprints? Edgeworth: Exactly. Meanwhile, who do these gloves, which are stained with the same kind of dirt, belong to? Kay: Oh, I remember! We found it at Blaise's place! Edgeworth: Earlier today, we went to Blaise's garage. There, we discovered these dirt-stained gloves. Come to think of it, there were also hammers, shovels, and other tools placed inside, as well. Why would mechanic's gloves, intended to be used on machines, be covered in dirt? If he broke the concrete with the hammer, and then dug into the soil with the shovel... ...then it's only natural for dirt like that to get on the gloves. Kay: Then, maybe...! Edgeworth: Yes. The true nature of the monster's footprints... has been made clear. It's possible that these footprints were dug up by Blaise Debeste himself. Lang: Lang: It's possible...? Hmph! It's possible, you say!? Please do enlighten me. 'Cuz I honestly have no clue! Why on earth would he do something like that? Edgeworth: (Why did he make the monster footprints? Thinking about it, the answer must be...) He was digging something up Edgeworth: It's possible he was digging something up. Leads to: \"It probably went something like this.\" He buried something Edgeworth: Could it have been because he buried something? Kay: He buried something!? I smell treasure! So, what did he bury? Edgeworth: If we want to find that out, we'll have to dig it up ourselves. Lang: Lang: You think the police wouldn't have already investigated that? There was absolutely nothing buried beneath those footprints! Edgeworth: Nngwaaah! (It seems that was wrong...) In that case, we should assume the opposite: he dug something up. Leads to: \"It probably went something like this.\" Edgeworth: It probably went something like this. Last night at this spot, there was something that Blaise needed to dig up. For that reason, he broke the lock on the back door ans sneaked into the film lot... Using the hammer and shovel, he set to work. He placed the items he dug up into his bag, but before he could fill in the holes... Kay: Ah! That's when Shaun came to practice! Edgeworth: Exactly. Blaise panicked, and had no choice but to hide himself in the Moozilla costume nearby. Lang: Grr... To think you would deduce so much from just a pair of dirt-stained gloves... However! All of this is merely a possibility! There's still no proof that he was the one who was hiding inside that costume! For all we know, he might've left the scene once he finished digging! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: On the contrary. Such proof does exist, and can be seen... in the video. When this video was recorded, Blaise was definitely inside the film lot. Lang: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (Though I can't blame Agent Lang for not noticing... ...the difference between the current flim lot... ...and the one in Shaun's video. Along with the state of Blaise's garage... ...it's all too clear that Blaise was still here!) What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded? Present duffel bag beside monster costume Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This bag placed near the costume...\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This proves that Blaise was still at the film lot! Kay: Umm... How exactly does it prove that? Lang: Yeah, I'd like a better explanation as well! Edgeworth: ...Argh! (So this has nothing to do with Blaise...) Kay: If something belonging to Blaise could be seen in this video, then proving it would be easy... Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything that comes to mind? Edgeworth: (Something belonging to Blaise... Does anything like that appear in the video?) Lang: Well, Mr. Prosecutor!? How about it...? Is there really any evidence that Blaise Debeste was there? Edgeworth: There's no need to rush, Agent Lang. Leads back to: \"What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded?\" Edgeworth: This bag placed near the costume... There was an identical one inside Blaise's garage. Lang: ! Edgeworth: First, the dirt on the gloves, and now the bag... It seems there is a connection. Mechanic's Gloves data updated in my Organizer. Edgeworth: And that's my proof. Blaise was inside the costume. Ergo, the president's body could not have been hidden inside it! Lang: Aiyaaaaaaaaa! Edgeworth: (It seems I was able to refute Agent Lang's reasoning.) Gumshoe: Someone needs to go investigate Blaise's house right away, pal! We need to know what was inside that bag! Officer: Yessir! Lotta: Y'all pipe down and listen up! Y'all just been sayin' whatever works best for y'all! Edgeworth: (...And the noisy one returns.) Lotta: That there's the footprints of the Mighty Moozilla! They ain't just some random holes dug up by that old coot! Edgeworth: Hmph. I believe the true nature of these footprints has already been proven quite logically. Lotta: Logic schmogic, I ain't buyin' it! Say whatcha want, but I know what I saw, and I saw Moozilla! Edgeworth: (Is she referring to how she saw Moozilla out of the window of the Grand Tower...? Preposterous.) Nicole: Upon our journalist's souls, we ain't havin' none of it! Edgeworth: (That statement is an insult to journalists everywhere...) Nicole: Ah! That's right! There's more to them monsters than just those footprints! I remember hearin' that sonny over there was seen with the monster earlier! I reckon that gal over there said she witnessed it herself! Edgeworth: (When these two are together, all meaningful talk grinds to a halt...) Kay: If we only knew just what the \"monster\" really was, I think those two would quiet down. Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything you can do? Edgeworth: (The monster's true identity...?) We don't have much choice... Let's see what we can do. Lotta: Isn't there somethin' y'all ain't tellin' us about the monster!? Nicole! Ask 'em! Ask 'em right now! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ....Please settle down. Regarding the true identity of that \"monster\", I already know what it is. Lotta: Wha'd ya say!? Edgeworth: That's right. The video Shaun recorded provided the hint that I needed... Lotta: Whatchu talkin' bout? Edgeworth: (Ms. Nichols saw Gourdy... ...when she went to check up on Shaun's practice. At that times, she mistook \"something\" for Gourdy.) The \"monster\" can be seen in this photograph. Lotta: What!? Ain't that just some plain old souvenir photo!? Y'all don't really think ya can pull the wool over the eyes of a pro like me, do ya? Edgeworth: (What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?) Present camera crane Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was...\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The \"Gourdy\" that Ms. Nichols saw... was actually this! Lotta: There ain't no foolin' a real pro! Yer sayin' this is Gourdy!? It don't look nothin' like it! Edgeworth: Argh! (I had my suspicions...) Kay: Let's double-check what Gourdy looks like. Something with a similar shape might be in the photo! Edgeworth: Indeed. (Gourdy's shape...?) Leads back to: \"(What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?)\" Edgeworth: Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was... ...this camera crane! Lotta: Wh-What!? Edgeworth: The video Shaun recorded was shot from fairly high up. A shot from this position would be impossible without a camera crane. Nicole: But...! There ain't no way Ms. Nichols would mistake a camera crane for Gourdy! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I wonder about that. ...Ms. Nichols. Penny: Y-Yes! Edgeworth: Earlier, you said the prescription for your glasses didn't match your eyesight anymore, correct? Penny: Yes. Lately, it seems like my eyesight has suddenly gotten a lot worse. Edgeworth: So would you say that you weren't able to see Gourdy very clearly in the dark? Penny: That's right... Its silhouette was all I could make out... Nicole: But, remember what Ms. Nichols said!? And I quote, \"Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile...\"! Lotta: Camera cranes ain't got no flesh on 'em, let alone skin! It's just a bare steel frame! Edgeworth: That is certainly true. At least, in the case of this photo... However, last night it did have skin. Lotta: Y'all just doin' whatever ya can to get in the way of our big scoop, ain't ya!? Edgeworth: (That was not my intention... ...but since I've come this far, it's time to put an end to your nonsense.) Gourdy's skin is right before our very eyes. This is the \"skin\" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw! Present vinyl sheets Edgeworth: Leads to: \"As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night.\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is the true identity of Gourdy's skin! Lotta: And just how could somethin' like that be taken for skin, ya heinous prosecutor!? Yer just spoutin' nonsense, tryin' to take our whole scoop for yerself! Yer pure evil! Yer a demon prosecutor! Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (That is decidedly not what I'm trying to do.) On its own, the crane bears no resemblance to Gourdy at all. Kay: Something must have been draped over the crane. Edgeworth: (Last night, it looked like it was going to rain... And if that's the case, there's only one thing it could have been!) Leads back to: \"This is the \"skin\" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw!\" Edgeworth: As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night. While it never actually rained... ...Shaun still covered the camera crane with a rainproof sheet. Which, to Ms. Nichols... looked like a monster's skin! Nicole: Whaaaaaaaat! Lotta: Y-Ya gotta be kiddin' meeee! Edgeworth: Isn't that right, Shaun? Shaun: Man, you saw through it all. .....Not bad, old man. Edgeworth: Unfortunately, the \"Gourdy\" that Ms. Nichols saw was nothing more than an illusion. Lotta: Not again... Looks like my dream has shriveled up and died once again... Nicole: M-Mentor! Kay: Seems like things have finally settled down. Lotta: I really thought the boy was hidin' somethin' from me... Guess I had it all wrong. Lang: ...Now that we've figured out the true form of the monster, everyone seems refreshed. Kay: Actually, there's two people here who are totally bummed out. Forensics: Agent Lang! The report is in, sir! We've got the results of President Huang's autopsy! Lang: Good! Show it to me! Lang: \"Contusions and bone fractures found across the body, resulting from tremendous pressure.\" So, this was the cause of death. In other words... he was crushed to death. Edgeworth: (I thought as much...) Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer. Lang: The yellow stain on his chest is currently under investigation... ...but it seems that gunpowder residue was found on his right hand. Kay: Sunflower residue!? I didn't know the president was into gardening! Edgeworth: No, gunpowder residue. Traces of it are left behind when a gun is fired. Since it has been found on his right hand, it's possible that the president fired a gun. Kay: A gun, huh? But we didn't find any guns when we investigated this area. Edgeworth: (...Unexplained gunpowder residue? I'll have to look over the autopsy report later.) Now then, Agent Lang. It seems we have our answer. The president did not die from falling off the roof of the Grand Tower. Rather, he died from being crushed under Moozilla's head! Lang: I can't deny it... Looks like your logic was right after all. Kay: This means the suspicions surrounding Ms. Gravelle should be cleared up, right!? Edgeworth: Yes... Not only the cause of death, but the time of death proves her innocence as well. Judge Gravelle met with the president two nights ago. However, according to the autopsy report, the time of death was around 11 PM last night. Moozilla's head also fell last night... It matches up perfectly. Kay: That's a relief! Lang: Lang: ...Isn't it a bit too early to be relieved? Edgeworth: (Agent Lang?) Lang: The president died after being crushed by the Moozilla's head. That, I will admit. But the problem is, who was responsible for the falling head...? Edgeworth: Moozilla's head fell last night. And last night, the one who was at the film lot was... Gravelle: Gravelle: What are you saying!? Surely, you're not implying... Lang: That's right. You killed him, didn't you? Shaun Fenn! Shaun: ........ Lang: That pup is hiding something. He was at the scene where the body was discovered last night. He also saw the \"footprints\". And despite that, he still claims to know absolutely nothing about the incident? Isn't that a bit too convenient? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: These footprint-shaped holes have not been proven to be related to the case! Just because he saw the holes, doesn't necessarily mean that he's involved in the incident! Lang: Lang: You sure about that? Take a look at the pup's face. Shaun: .............. Lang: He looks pretty shaken up to me. Edgeworth: (It looks like he hit the mark... but Shaun doesn't want to talk about it.) Lang: If he doesn't feel like talking, then I have an idea of my own. Let's check the tape. Edgeworth: Agent Lang. What is your intention? Lang: The police have a device that lets you analyze the video footage up close and personal. Gravelle: Agent Lang. You would suspect Shaun enough to go that far... Edgeworth: (As long as Shaun's lips are sealed... ...this may be the only way for us to get closer to the truth.) Detective Gumshoe! If I'm not mistaken you have that device with you, correct? Gumshoe: Mr. Analysis is ready to go, sir! Lang: Now we're talking! Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth. Would you please perform the video analysis for us? Edgeworth: (She wants me to do it...?) Gravelle: Who knows what kind of faults that wolf-man will find in it! Edgeworth: (This isn't exactly my strong suit, but I suppose I have no choice... Are there any new clues shown on the video?) Monster costume Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It's the Moozilla costume. If you zoom in, you can see that the back is unzipped. Kay: Yeah. Mr. Powers was supposed to get inside to play the monster in the movie. ...But, I don't really get it. The Mozilla in the movie is supposed to be big enough to demolish an entire building. Once he's inside the costume, how does he activate its megazord form? Edgeworth: ...I think you have a big misunderstanding. The costume doesn't actually become big. Kay: I see. So what's big is not the costume, but the misunderstanding. Hmm... I think I kinda get it now. Thanks! Edgeworth: (Does she really understand...?) Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Dirt ground Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Blaised Debeste used the tools in his garage to dig up something. Kay: There was a huge hammer in his garage too. Edgeworth: Indeed. That was probably used to break the concrete. As it turns out, these weren't Moozilla's footprints at all. Are you disappointed? Kay: A Great Thief needs to have the strength to accept the truth, no matter how hard it is. I must become stronger. Much, much stronger! Edgeworth: (...I guess she couldn't handle the truth.) Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Di-Jun Huang (after zooming) Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(Th-This is...!)\" Anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's nothing of interest here. Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Edgeworth: (Th-This is...!) Kay: What's the matter? I wanna see too! ...Hm? Eeeeeeeeeek! Lang: Hey! What's wrong!? Show it to me! Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth! I request you submit the evidence to the court! Edgeworth: ...Please take a look at the top right corner of the zoomed-in video. Lang: Th-This... This person is...! ...th-the presideeeeeent! Gravelle: Impossible! Shaun: Huh!? N-No way! Lang: It seems we've finally found it at last. The evidence that points to the true killer...! Edgeworth: (This video places Shaun at a major disadvantage...!) Shaun: Y-You're wrong! That's not right! I didn't know anything about this! Lang: That's not gonna cut it. It's clear that you and the victim were together at the same place where his body was later found! Shaun Fenn! There's no doubt. You killed the president! Gravelle: N-No! This can't be...! Why, why would you...? Shaun... please don't tell me... Did you really kill the president? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Is this really decisive evidence...? Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. Looks like even you can't object to this. Edgeworth: (Ngh...!) Lang: That pup said he didn't know anything, right? And yet, the president's right here in the video! Shaun: ........ Edgeworth: Shaun! What are you hiding? Gravelle: Shaun...! Please tell us the truth! Shaun: .......... The truth is... The truth is... It's all my fault... Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! What did you do!? Shaun: M-M-Moozilla's head falling was all my fault! -- During the Rehearsal -- Shaun: While I was setting up the equipment on the roof, I used the heater... After that, I went down to practice, but I forgot to turn it off. Then my mom called me, so I left the film lot. When I came back to the lot, after the phone call was over... Moozilla's head that was on the roof had fallen... And right next to it was the president, lying dead on the ground... Gravelle: H-How can that be...? Edgeworth: I see. There were indeed traces that something had caught fire on the rooftop. Shaun: ..It was just a small fire, so I was able to put it out by myself. Kay: So... the president's death was Shaun's fault? Gumshoe: But, wouldn't that make this an accident, sir? Edgeworth: ...And then, what did you do with the fallen head? Shaun: I took it apart, brought the pieces up to the roof, and put it back together. Lang: Lang: So, you put out the fire, and even put the fallen head back on the roof. Which means you were hiding evidence... We can't be having that, you naughty little pup. Shaun: I didn't do it on purpose! I really did just forget to turn off the heater... Edgeworth: When the legs broke, the stand would have tilted. If Moozilla's head was on top of the stand... Kay: ...it would've fallen off! So, the head fell down because of the fire! Edgeworth: Yes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness. Lang: Lang: ...Was it really just an accident? If that's the truth, then what was the president doing here? Shaun: I-I don't know! There was no one else around when I was there! Lang: You expect me to believe that!? The president wouldn't have just come to a place like this without a reason, you know! Edgeworth: (Indeed, the president's reason for coming here is still a huge mystery... Two nights ago, he met with Judge Gravelle on the roof of the Grand Tower... ...and last night, he was here at the film lot. Did he meet with Shaun...? I'll have to listen to Shaun's testimony very carefully...!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. You are still young. I know it can get a little cold in early spring, but you shouldn't have to resort to a heater... Gravelle: Gravelle: It is precisely because he is young that he must make sure to take good care of himself! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: However, while it can get a bit chilly during this time of year, I wouldn't necessarily say... Shaun: Hold it, old man. Is this really the right time to be having this argument? Edgeworth: G..... Gah! (He's completely right.) Gravelle: Shaun. You did well to get the better of Mr. Edgeworth, but please mind your language. Edgeworth: (Let's not forget that he got the better of you too, Your Honor...) Shaun: I-I know, Mom... So, umm... where was I? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You forgot to turn off the heater? You didn't check it before leaving the roof? Shaun: I meant to turn it off, but I was too focused on practicing, so... And come on, everyone forgets stuff like that sometimes! Kay: Yeah, I gotcha! I forget small things like that all the time too! Like sometimes, I'll forget to turn off the AC or the lights in Mr. Edgeworth's office... ...or I'll jump off the ladder for his bookshelves, or leave prank calls on his answering machine. But forgetting to turn off the heater is really dangerous, so you've gotta be careful! Edgeworth: (Some of those things had nothing to do with forgetfulness...) Shaun. Please continue. Shaun: Looks like you've got it rough too, old man. Well, back to my story... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It was late at night at the film lot... and not a single member of the film crew was around. So then, why did you have to leave the premises in order to answer the phone call? Shaun: I totally forgot about the phone call thing... so I kinda panicked. If I didn't answer it fast, I would have been busted for leaving the hotel without permission. Edgeworth: In that case, why didn't you just answer it here? Shaun: B-Because I was rehearsing, all the cameras and mics were on. If I talked here, every last word I said to Mom would've been caught on camera! Edgeworth: (So he was embarrassed that the conversation with his mother would be recorded.) Shaun: Anyways, I stopped practicing for a bit and rushed out of the film lot. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that phone call, you lied and said you were at the hotel, correct? Kay: Why didn't you tell your mom that you were rehearsing? Shaun: If I told her that, she would've called the hotel and made them send me a taxi or something. Gravelle: Gravelle: Of course I would have! A child alone on the streets at the time of night... What sort of parent would allow their child to be in such a dangerous situation!? Edgeworth: Hmm. I guess kids just don't understand how their parents feel. Kay: It goes both ways, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Now then, Shaun. Please tell us about what happened after the phone call. Shaun: Huh? O-Oh yeah. Of course. When the call was finished and I came back here... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was there any indication that the head was about to fall? Shaun: ...I-I don't know. I was focused on my rehearsal. Edgeworth: So you forgot to turn off the heater, which led to a fire on the roof. I would think you should have at least heard something. Shaun: Heard something...? Oh, I was wearing headphones, so... Edgeworth: Headphones? Shaun: Listening to the movie's soundtrack helps me get into the scene... I had it on full blast. That's why I didn't hear anything. Edgeworth: And yet, you noticed your mother's incoming call? Shaun: I had my phone on vibrate, old man. That's how I noticed. Anyways, the head had fallen... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What was the state of the body? Shaun: ...I didn't get a good look. 'Cause it was dark. ........ Edgeworth: (Hm? He's suddenly become as quiet as a mouse.) Kay: I guess Shaun doesn't really want to remember anything about the body... Edgeworth: (...Is that the only reason why he's gone so quiet? Should I press him for more details?) Press him further Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Leave him be Edgeworth: (It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.) Edgeworth: You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead? Shaun: ! Th-That's... well... Edgeworth: (He's clearly shaken. ...He must be hiding something.) Wouldn't you normally call for help if you see someone collapsed on the ground? However, you did nothing of the sort... Shaun: But... But he...! He was already dead... Edgeworth: Is that so? You seem quite certain that the president was already dead... Now, is there a reason for that, I wonder? Shaun: The guy was collapsed on the ground, and right next to him was the fallen monster's head. I'm not stupid. It wasn't hard to imagine what happened... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You can imagine whatever you want, but there was no way for you to know that he was dead! You actually checked to make sure the president was dead, didn't you? Shaun: Urk.....! Y-Yeah... that's right! I was scared... but I got up close to the body and checked to see if he was breathing. Edgeworth: (I thought as much... However, why would he hide that? There must be a reason...) ...Please tell me the state of the body at that time. Shaun: A-At first, I didn't know he was dead... I would've realized sooner if there had been any blood... ...but there wasn't a single drop, and his clothes were completely spotless. Either way, he wasn't breathing. That's how I knew he was already dead... Edgeworth: ...Would you please append those statements to your testimony? Add statements: \"I didn't know right away that he was dead. There was no blood, and his clothes were spotless.\" and \"But he wasn't breathing at all when I checked, so I knew he was already dead.\" Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Edgeworth: (It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you knew immediately that it was the president? Shaun: Not right away. It was dark, so I had to get a bit closer. But... I knew his face because we worked together briefly, after all. Kay: Y-You worked with the president!? Wow, Shaun...! When did you do that!? Edgeworth: Have you already forgotten, Kay? The president had a cameo in this movie. Kay: Ah! That's right! Of course... N-Now I remember! Edgeworth: Good for you. So, Shaun. You confirmed he was dead? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were unable to tell if he was dead because of the lack of stains on his clothes... Are you certain of that? Shaun: Of course I am. You guys saw the body too, right? So what's the big ideal!? Edgeworth: You said that the area was dark. And yet, you were still able to make that observation? Shaun: I'm telling you, there wasn't a single stain on his entire body! Give it a rest, old man! Edgeworth: Heh... Thank you, Shaun. That was all I needed to hear. Kay: Are clean clothes that important to you, Mr. Edgeworth? Mine are freshly washed though! Edgeworth: Next... could you tell me how you determined that the president was dead? Shaun: Well, there wasn't anything to let me know right away that he was dead, you see... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did you check if he had stopped breathing? Shaun: They taught us how at school. You get right up close to the person's nose... ...and check to see if you can feel their breath. I never thought I'd have to do it for real, though... Kay: That was really brave of you, to be able to do something like that. Shaun, you sure are amazing for an elementary school kid. Edgeworth: Kay, he's in middle school. Please try to get that into your head sometime soon... Kay: It'd be pretty scary to see a corpse just suddenly appear out of the blue like that... Not to mention the fallen monster head lying next to the body. Edgeworth: Panic would certainly be an understandable response to such a situation. Kay: But still, all things considered... This was just an accident, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. That is, if we decide to take Shaun's words at face value... (I wouldn't mind having some more concrete details on the state of the crime scene...)-- Kanis's Savior -- Kanis: Certainly, it was I who killed President Huang. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You admitted that rather easily. Kanis: These days, I have long grown tired of killing. ...Keh heh heh. But in those halcyon days, I devoted myself to the path of an executioner. If one cannot admit that much, what can he admit? Right, Anubis? Yes, yes, my boy. Kay: I feel like he's saying something scary, but it's kind of hard to understand him! Edgeworth: This fallen priest is saying he has no feelings about the president's death. (Kanis, the assassin and escaped prisoner. He should be a despicable opponent, but... ...silencing him now would be imprudent. I must keep my composure and let him talk!) I understand your point. ...You killed the president. Kanis: That is correct. The aim of my blade never misses its mark. Kanis: However, my life was also targeted on that day. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your life was targeted? You, the assassin? Kay: The hunter becomes the hunted. The Buddhist becomes the Buddha. Edgeworth: Kay, you don't have to make up strange proverbs. Kanis: ...Life is transient. Especially for an assassin, whose life is always exposed to danger. Kay: So, does that mean people you've tried to kill have fought back? Kanis: That is a rare occurrence... However, this was different. Kanis: The body double, Blaise, and Fifi all sought to seal my lips. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Bodhidharma Kanis. You are a master assassin. As such, could you not have evaded an attack from those three and fled the scene...? Kanis: Keh heh heh. You greatly overestimate me. Without Anubis by my side, I would not even be able to walk about. If those three were to attack me all at once, I would not stand a chance. Edgeworth: I see. So even an assassin will fall to superior numbers in a frontal assault. Kanis: I suppose one could say that. I, Bodhidharma Kanis, would have suffered a shameful defeat. Kanis: Had I not been reunited with the young acolyte back then, I would have been in danger. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Reunited...? So, when did you first meet with him? Kanis: That would be 18 years ago, on the 24th of December. Edgeworth: (That is a rather long time ago...) Kanis: On that day, our roles were reversed. I saved the young one's life. There was an unusual snowstorm on that day. The temperature was well below freezing. I took Anubis for a walk in the snow. That's when Anubis noticed something and started running. I followed after him and found a car. I had great difficulty opening the door. It had frozen shut. In the back seat... there were two young children, shivering from the cold. Edgeworth: Two children? Kanis: Had they remained in the car for an hour longer, they surely would have frozen to death. I brought the two of them to a nearby orphanage... Edgeworth: (Is there anything about Kanis's story that concerns me?) There is something Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Leave him be Edgeworth: (I don't think there's anything in particular that stands out...) Kanis, please continue your testimony. Edgeworth: (What concerns me is...) The date Leads to: \"The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that?\" The number of children Edgeworth: There were two children in the car... you're sure of that? Kanis: It may have been 18 years ago, but I remember it clearly. There were two children in the car, there is no mistaking it. Does the good prosecutor have a problem with that number? Edgeworth: (Right now, the number of children isn't what I have a problem with.) Kanis: Are we done talking about this subject yet? Leads back to: \"(What concerns me is...)\" The model of the car Edgeworth: What was the model of the car the children were in? Kanis: The model of the car? What would you want to know that for? It was a typical mid-size car, the kind you see everywhere. Other than the freezing children sitting inside, there was nothing unusual about it. Edgeworth: (...Looks like the car model is of no real importance.) Kanis: Are we done talking about this subject yet? Leads back to: \"(What concerns me is...)\" Edgeworth: The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that? Kanis: There is no mistake. Ray: C-Could that mean...!? Edgeworth: (I know... the significance behind that date.) What shows the significance of the date when Kanis found the children? Present IS-7 Incident Documents Edgeworth: Leads to: \"That day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence is connected to that date, isn't it? Kay: Ummm... How exactly is it connected? Kanis: I don't know what the good prosecutor brought out... ...but I can sense that there is no real connection behind it. Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (Kanis saw through it.) Kay: Mr. Kanis found the children on December 24th! Let's try looking at the evidence again with that date in mind! Leads back to: \"(I know... the significance behind that date.)\" Kanis: But alas, even to this day, I do not know what has become of the young acolyte... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And now you're searching for the boy from all those years ago? Surely, you're not saying you want to thank him for saving you? Kanis: Keh heh heh... Well, who knows. However, the young one did save my life. That is the truth. Even Anubis took a liking to him. He would do tricks for him, such as \"shake\" or \"roll over\". Kay: I thought that the tricks Kanis taught his dog were a little bit different from the norm, though. Kanis: You are right about that. For Anubis, \"roll over\" means first biting the victim's foot... Kay: Stop! Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear any more! Kanis: Keh heh heh... There is no need to worry, I only showed the young one ordinary tricks. Edgeworth: (...Hmm. I get the feeling that Kanis, in his own way, felt indebted to the boy.) Kay: Mr. Kanis and that \"acolyte\" seem to share a complicated relationship, huh. Edgeworth: Perhaps there is a hint to the mastermind's motive hidden somewhere in his testimony. Kanis is one of the few people who knows the mastermind first hand... Let's try to draw out as much information as possible from him. Edgeworth: That day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered. Kay: Ah! Edgeworth: During that incident, two young boys went missing. The sons of the victim, Isaac Dover, and the culprit, Dane Gustavia... Ray: We never did find out where those two boys went after the case 18 years ago... Kanis: Oh? They were the sons of a victim and a culprit? It all makes sense now. Edgeworth: What makes sense? Kanis: One of the youths was bound, so that he could not move. Kay: Mr. Dover did it so that Mr. Gustavia's son couldn't come to the contest venue. Edgeworth: Indeed. Gustavia was using his own son as a taste tester. Kanis: Keh heh heh heh. To think that was what transpired. Neither child seemed to recall what had happened. Edgeworth: They lost their memories? Kanis: The acolyte told me this when we were reunited 12 years ago. The pair were placed in an extreme situation, on the verge of freezing to death... That trauma led them both to suffer from amnesia. Neither could so much as remember his own name. Kay: So they didn't even know that they were the sons of Mr. Dover and Mr. Gustavia. Edgeworth: Indeed, while we cannot say it conclusively, the probability is quite high. (However, we still don't have enough information to deduce the mastermind's identity...) Kanis... Would you please continue your story? Kanis: Keh heh. Very well. -- Kanis and the \"Acolyte\" -- Kanis: I continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison. Recently, that has all come to an abrupt halt, however. It left me quite concerned. Furthermore, those involved in the crime 12 years ago were all drawn into incidents one by one. I grew more and more curious. And so I absconded briefly from the prison. Edgeworth: Those involved 12 years ago... ...were Fifi Laguarde, Blaise Debeste, and President Huang's body double. Kay: And Ms. Laguarde was the warden of Mr. Kanis's prison. Kanis: Keh heh heh. I blackmailed the warden. That woman had tried to kill me. Perhaps the good prosecutor has already deduced the reason? Edgeworth: You murdered President Huang... However, the world still believed he was alive. If you were able to prove the president was a fake... ...both Fifi Laguarde and Blaise Debeste would have been in danger. Kanis: That is correct. And I had heard the proof with my own ears. I'll be waiting in the courtyard of the orphanage at midnight on February 9th. Even if it's just once, I want Shaun to be able to meet you. I'm sorry if I'm being selfish, but... I'll be waiting. Huang: ...Who might you be? My apologies, but I am presently waiting for someone... Kanis: Keh heh heh. I am well aware of that... President Huang. Are you not meeting with your son? However, I do not spill blood needlessly. You may relax. I seek only the president's life. Huang: .........It can't be. P-Please wait. I am just about to meet my son for the first time. I'm sure this will be the first and the last time. Please, at least wait until we are finished... Kanis: I had thought the president would beg for his life, but he was of a different sort. Officially, the president had no son. However, he shook his head and said... ...this illegitimate son was his, and he intended to recognize him publicly. Furthermore, he claimed that he had already made preparations towards that end... Would that son of his be the boy with horns over there by any chance? Kay: Boy... with the horns? Wait, you can see Shaun's horns? Kanis: Keh heh heh. There is no need to see them. From the moment I escaped from prison until now... ...I have been closely lending an ear to your voices. Edgeworth: (He said that the president made \"preparations\" towards recognizing his son... ...but the word \"preparations\" alone would be insufficient for blackmail.) ........That's it! Lang: There was one thing that could prove Huang's words: the will held by the House of Lang. It was also proof of his trust in us. His son's existence would've been revealed to the world. Kanis: The name on the recording, the mention of preparations, and the will in Zheng Fa... Keh heh heh. Together, they sufficed to make the Warden bow to my words. Edgeworth: (With those three pieces of information, one could prove the identity of the double... ...by using Shaun!) Shaun: .......... Kanis: The president blocked the first strike of my knife with something soft. As pieces of it fell atop the snow, I struck once more. This time, the blow proved fatal. Edgeworth: (So Kanis cut off the Moozilla doll's horn...) Kanis: None but I heard his final words. Only myself and that child knew of the president's secret son. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In other words, you contacted him from prison? Kanis: Keh heh heh. That is correct. A post-office box was used. Kay: A post-office box...? Edgeworth: It would allow one to send and receive letters without revealing the recipient's location. Kanis: I could not use a form of correspondence that would reveal the acolyte's location. ...There was someone keeping watch over my correspondences, after all. Edgeworth: (He must mean the prison warden... Fifi Laguarde.) Could you be more specific about the nature of your correspondences? Kanis: Well. They were mainly moves from my correspondence chess matches. Kay: C-Correspondence chess? If I recall, the person you were playing against... Edgeworth: This might be hard to believe... but Kanis's chess opponent was... Kay: Ah! Are you saying he was playing against Mr. Knightley? Wasn't it Horace Knightley? Edgeworth: We certainly found the correspondence chess memo in Knightley's cell. Correspondence Chess Memo jotted down in my Organizer. Ray: Does that mean... Knightley-boy was the kid from the IS-7 Incident? Edgeworth: (Could... that really be true? Is there any evidence connecting Knightley to the IS-7 Incident?) Present Knightley's Mementos Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence. Ray: What about it? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think it has anything to do with the incident at all, though. Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (Perhaps I should think it over one more time?) Ray: Why don't you look over Knightley-boy's belongings one more time? Something related to the IS-7 Incident just might pop out! Edgeworth: (Knightley's belongings, huh? Let's look over them one more time...) Edgeworth: (This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within? Which should I investigate? The ring or the chessboard...?) The ring Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" The chessboard Edgeworth: (Obviously, we should investigate the chessboard.) Ray: Huh? Miles, what are you doing taking out the chessboard? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think the chessboard has anything to do with the IS-7 Incident. Edgeworth: Argh! (He may be right... In that case, the only piece of evidence left to investigate is...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: This ring is...! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, what is it? Edgeworth: Mr. Shields, please take a look at this ring! Ray: Th-This pattern is... It's Pierre Hoquet's! Edgeworth: I thought so... He had Mr. Dover's seal turned into a ring. However, why would he have this? Shouldn't it have been held by the police as evidence from the IS-7 Incident? Ray: After the incident, the seal was returned to the victim's next-of-kin. And Mr. Dover's only family was his son. But since no one knew where the son had gone to, it took a while to get it to him. I'd heard that the police had finally found him and delivered his inheritance, but... Edgeworth: ...So the seal was thereby safely delivered to his son. And then, he turned the seal into a ring and wore it on his person. Knightley's Mementos data updated in my Organizer. Kay: So... Mr. Knightley was Mr. Dover's son... Ray: The police aren't fools. I'm sure they did a thorough check before handing over the seal. Kay: If someone involved in the IS-7 Incident was his chess opponent... Lang: Knightley, huh. Then that man must be the mastermind behind this case! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But, Knightley is dead! He cannot be involved in this incident. Ray: How about that. The only one who could be the mastermind was himself a murder victim...? Kay: But a dead guy can't be the culprit! So there's no way that's right! Edgeworth: (It certainly is strange... In that case, who is the culprit?) Add statement: \"Writing letters in braille can be a rather enjoyable pastime.\" Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence. Ray: What about it? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think it has anything to do with the incident at all, though. Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (Perhaps I should think it over one more time?) Ray: Why don't you look over Knightley-boy's belongings one more time? Something related to the IS-7 Incident just might pop out! Edgeworth: (Knightley's belongings, huh? Let's look over them one more time...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: (Obviously, we should investigate the chessboard.) Ray: Huh? Miles, what are you doing taking out the chessboard? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think the chessboard has anything to do with the IS-7 Incident. Edgeworth: Argh! (He may be right... In that case, the only piece of evidence left to investigate is...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That was your means of playing correspondence chess. You used chess notation for your moves. Kanis: Keh heh heh... as expected, the good prosecutor has done a thorough investigation. Kay: His chess opponent was Horace Knightley, right? Edgeworth: The ring Knightley wore... Mr. Shields, please have a close look at it. Ray: Yeah, there's no mistake. This is the evidence from the IS-7 Incident. The police found Mr. Dover's son and returned it to him. If you're saying that the son was Knightley, then... ...the acolyte, who was Kanis's chess opponent and the mastermind, was Knightley? Edgeworth: No, Knightley has already been murdered. He cannot be at the center of the incident. There is no doubt that the mastermind is still hiding somewhere out there. Kay: ...Well then, Mr. Kanis. Sorry to have kept you waiting. Kanis: Hmm... that was a rather interesting tale. Wasn't it, Anubis? I shall continue my story about the acolyte. Our longstanding chess match continued... Edgeworth: (It seems she's not much good with the assassin's dog.) Kanis: Good boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It came to a halt? Now, of all times? Kanis: Quite odd, is it not? Anubis told me again and again how odd it was. Kay: That scary dog talked? Was he like, \"Something's odd, woof!\"? Kanis: Keh heh heh. I can understand Anubis's heart, even if he does not voice his thoughts. Kay: Umm... Then, there's something I'd like to ask, just in case. Your scary dog's staring at me right now... He's not saying, \"I'm hungry. I want some meat\", right? Kanis: Keh heh heh... Perhaps. Kay: P... Perhaps... Aaaaah... M-Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (It seems she's not much good with the assassin's dog.) Kanis: Good boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That certainly does seem too much for a mere coincidence. The body double of Di-Jun Huang, the president of Zheng Fa faked an assassination plot. Fifi Laguarde, the prison warden, murdered Horace Knightley. And Blaise Debeste, the Chairman of the P.I.C, murdered Jill Crane. (Come to think of it, as I have been investigating these cases... ...I have felt the presence of some force behind the scenes.) Kanis: Keh heh heh. Even within the prison, I could tell that this was no insignificant event. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You absconded briefly from prison? I cannot forgive such a criminal act! Kay: You stole your way out of prison? I cannot forgive such a thieving act! Kanis: Keh heh heh... Relax. No one was hurt. I merely have connections that allow me to set foot outside. Gumshoe: B-But even so, you can't just escape from prison, pal! Arrest him! Arrest him! Kanis: That won't be necessary. Once my business is done, I shall return to my cell. Lang: ...You trying to make fools of us? A prison isn't the kind of place you can just enter and leave at will! Kanis: Keh heh heh. The Wolf may say that... ...but one can see that the Wolf and his pack also share an interest in the tales of my past. Lang: Tch...! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, Detective Gumshoe. There are still a few things I must ask Kanis. Please postpone matters until then. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I knew you'd say that, Mr. Edgeworth! Lang: Dammit all... But I'm not taking my eye off you for a second! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Excuse me, but you wrote your letters in braille? Kanis: Indeed. For I possess the tools necessary to write in braille. Kay: Wow. So you need to use tools to write in braille. I never knew. Edgeworth: Then, would you please tell us what you wrote? Kanis: Everything. Letters, of course, and also the movements of the chess pieces. Edgeworth: (He wrote the movements of the chess pieces by hand? That statement is... intriguing.) Kay: So then, how does your handmade dog piece move? Edgeworth: Kay, that question can wait. So then... what did you do when the letters stopped coming? Kanis: Keh heh heh... Within the prison, I grew increasingly concerned about the acolyte's whereabouts. Kay: OK, OK... Umm... But even so, I don't really get it. Who exactly is this \"acolyte\"? Edgeworth: Indeed. Kanis himself has not yet made that clear. (What's important is the thread connecting Kanis and this \"acolyte\": their correspondence. And not just the letters. We should pay attention to the means that was used as well.)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Kay Faraday\nDescription: A self-styled Great Thief and so-called \"second Yatagarasu\" who's always looking to bag the greatest treasure of all -- the truth.\nCharacter 1\nName: Lotta Hart\nDescription: A freelance photojournalist who I've met in the past.

    "cot": "Evidence 6 states \"The concrete was broken and the earth exposed after Excelsius Winner dug up President Wang's corpse.\" This suggests that the broken concrete and exposed earth (monster footprints) were made by Excelsius Winner digging up the corpse.\n\nHowever, in the story, Agent Lang claims that the monster costume's dirt came from the dirt where the body fell, and that someone else (Blaise Debeste) was inside the costume, who likely caused the dirt on the gloves (Evidence 14: Mechanic's Gloves) which were stained with dirt matching that at the scene.\n\nTherefore, the assertion that it was Excelsius Winner who dug up the spend concrete and earth in Evidence 6 contradicts testimony/claims in the story that Blaise Debeste was the one who dug up the dirt, and was inside the costume.\n\nSince the testmonies are not fully enumerated for Excelsius Winner directly, the contradiction lies in Evidence 6 (about the monster footprints being made by Excelsius Winner digging up the body) and the fact that Agent Lang (Testimony or lines by him) claims Blaise Debeste dug up the footprints. This is a contradiction between the evidence and the claims in testimony/conversation.\n\nFurthermore, the Mechanic's Gloves (Evidence 14), which are dirt-stained, were identified as worn by Excelsius Winner (a.k.a. Blaise Debeste), but Evidence 6 says Excelsius Winner dug up the concrete, which conflicts with the fact that in dialogue, Lang disputes this as a possibility.\n\nGiven the prompt instructs to pick only one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other, I will pick Evidence 6 (Monster Footprints) and the statements/testimony that indicate that Blaise Debeste dug up the footprints, which contradicts the implication that the footprints were made by Excelsius Winner.\n\nHowever, the testimonies are labeled 0-4 and are all from Kanis. So from the provided testimonies, Kanis doesn't talk about the monster footprints or Excelsius Winner digging up the floor.\n\nHence I need to find a contradiction involving the evidences and testimonies listed.\n\nLooking over the testimonies (0-4) by Kanis:\n\n- Testimony 0 & 1: Kanis continued correspondence with the young acolyte after entering prison, which came to an abrupt halt recently.\n- Testimony 2: Those involved in the crime 12 years ago were drawn into incidents one by one.\n- Testimony 3: Kanis absconded briefly from prison due to concern over the abrupt halt in correspondence and incidents.\n- Testimony 4: Writing letters in braille is a pastime.\n\nAmong the evidence:\n\n- Evidence 31: Correspondence Chess Diagram, which relates to letters from Kanis retyped by the mastermind, sent to Bronco Knight.\n\nKanis's testimony states he wrote letters in braille and corresponded with the young acolyte.\n\nBut Evidence 31 notes that the correspondence chess memo were printed rather than handwritten, and letters from Kanis were retyped by the mastermind.\n\nTherefore, the testimony that Kanis wrote letters in braille conflicts with the evidence (31) that the correspondence chess letters were printed / retyped, not handwritten.\n\nThis is a direct contradiction between the testimony about Kanis writing letters in braille and evidence that the chess letters used were printed, not handwritten.\n\nHence, the contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 31: Correspondence Chess Diagram (letters retyped, printed, not handwritten)\n\nTestimony 4: Writing letters in braille can be a rather enjoyable pastime. (Kanis wrote letters in braille)\n\nTherefore, Kanis claims he wrote letters by hand in braille, but the evidence shows the letters were printed, retyped by the mastermind, and not handwritten.\n",

I reckon... yer through bein' a prosecutor, right? Edgeworth: Yes... that's true, I suppose. (I'm no longer a prosecutor. However...) Kay: You can't stop thinking about what Mr. de Killer said, right? Edgeworth: Indeed... de Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Edgeworth: (This case isn't over yet... The person in the red hood who kidnapped Kay at Gourd Lake... And this letter from an unknown sender. Someone's schemes are at work behind this case...) Lotta: Must be tough havin' a case you just solved still naggin' at the back of yer mind. Well, I got some investigatin' of my own to be doin', so I'll be off! Kay: That's amazing! You've already decided on your next scoop? Lotta: What're ya sayin' there, missy!? Don't you be underestimatin' the likes of Lotta Hart! I've covered a lotta scoops, ya know? I always have an extra scoop or two up my sleeves... ???: S-Someone! Help! Kay: Yikes! What's that!? ???: S-Someone! P-Please help! Edgeworth: (Hmm. This woman is...) What's happened!? ???: S-Somebody's dead! A m-monster...! Edgeworth: (A... monster?) Lotta: I-It's a scoop! A scoop's callin' me! ???: Please follow me! It's this way! Kay: Has something else happened? Again!? Edgeworth: I don't know... At any rate, we should follow her for now. Kay: Eh!? These are...!? Lotta: G-Genuine hoofprints! Edgeworth: (Hoofprints? Impossible! No animal could be this large...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Look! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang...! Why is he here?) Kay: Ah! Someone's on the ground! Edgeworth: (It can't be... The president of Zheng Fa... Di-Jun Huang!) Lang: ........ Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Lang: ......Mr. Prosecutor. Didn't take you long to get here. Edgeworth: What happened? Lang: What... happened? Ha! That's what I'd like to know! Edgeworth: (It would seem that he's in a considerable amount of shock over the president's death. However... ...what exactly are these giant footprints...? And what could have happened to the president?) Lotta: It's a m... m... monster! Edgeworth: A... monster? Lotta: Yessiree! Lookie here! Ain't no doubt about it, these are clearly the footprints of a monster! On this day, mankind received a grim reminder: we live in fear of the Mighty Moozilla! Edgeworth: (Mighty... Moozilla...?) Lotta: This here's a scoop! I got myself a scoop! \"Man Trampled to Death by Monster!\" I reckon it'll be the top story in tomorrow's paper! Edgeworth: (What nonsense... There are no such things as monsters... Wait, it can't be...?) Huang: I am Di-Jun Huang. I have heard of your deeds. You saved my country from a great crisis. Edgeworth: The real assassin was you all along...! de Killer: That is correct. I received a request from a key individual... ...to take the president's life... Edgeworth: (That man... could he have...?) Lang: Hey, you! Were you the first to discover the body? ???: Y-Yes, I...! Umm, well. Edgeworth: (! Agent Lang?) Lang: Lang Zi says: \"First come, first suspected.\" You! Did you really just discover the body!? ???: O-O-O-O-O-Of course! Kay: Please calm down! You're scaring her! Edgeworth: (He does seem to have lost his composure...) Lang: Tch. Calm down!? How am I supposed to calm down? Do you know who's been murdered!? Di-Jun Huang... the president of Zheng Fa! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. This isn't like you. Lang: ! Edgeworth: When we first met, you had an army of subordinates under your command... ...and you boasted of having the highest arrest rate in Interpol. And what now? Did you forget the fundamentals of investigation along with all of your men? Lang: What... did you say...? Edgeworth: Instead of questioning people at random, you should investigate the crime scene first. Am I wrong? Lang: ........Tch! I don't need you to tell me that. ...I'll do a thorough investigation. Edgeworth: (Well. At least it seems he's calmed for now...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Let's investigate too! Edgeworth: Yes. Let us investigate. (Right now, I do not have any investigation rights, but until the police arrive...) Lotta: What're y'all sayin'? Ain't it obvious who dunnit!? The man behind it all is the Mighty Moozilla! Hm? Well, I guess it ain't the \"man\" behind it, more like the \"monster\" behind it, ya know? Edgeworth: Good grief... Could you please just try not to interfere with the investigation? Lotta: Shut yer trap! Yer the one who better not be stickin' yer nose in my business! I ain't forgivin' ya if ya mess up my scoop! ???: Umm... Excuse me. Edgeworth: (Hmm. It's the woman who first discovered the body. I feel like I've seen her before...) ???: You're... Mr. Edgeworth, right? Do you remember me? Edgeworth: Umm. Y-Yes. That case... from before... Kay: Huh? Do you know her? Edgeworth: Yes, I do. (At least I think I do...) Kay: My name's Kay Faraday! I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! Penny: My. You have such a cute assistant? I'm Penny Nichols. I'm an assistant at Global Studios. I'm in charge of the props and sets. It's nice to meet you. Edgeworth: (Yes, that was it... I once handled a case that occurred during the filming of the Steel Samurai. This woman was a member of the show's staff, and she was involved in the incident. I must have met with her on numerous occasions over the course of the case... ...but to be honest, I had completely forgotten about her...) It's nice to see you again. The fact that you are here must mean that this place is... Penny: Yes! This is sort of an outdoor film lot for Global Studios. They're shooting a movie here right now. I was the first to arrive today, to set everything up for the filming... ...but everything seemed strange... Those giant footprints... and that... d-dead body... Edgeworth: I see. We shall examine the body. At any rate, could you please contact the police? Penny: Y-Yes! Right away! Edgeworth: (I'll have to take the time to listen to her story later... First, let's examine the scene. There are many things besides the body that concern me. I'll need to examine every nook and cranny of this place...) (Connecting \"Stepped on by a monster?\" and \"Monster's head\" Logic leads to:) Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. I'm going to take my leave here for a bit. There's something I have to check... Edgeworth: (Agent Lang. I wonder if he's caught onto something?) Hm? ???: ........ ........ Lang: ........ ???: .....Move it. Lang: What'd you say? Guess you're just a brat with no manners. ???: ...And you're an annoying old man. Quit your yapping already. Lang: ! Penny: I-I'm terribly sorry! Come on, Shaun! Lang: Tch! Penny: Oh! What were you doing!? ???: .......Who was that? Penny: Someone from the police! Why'd you suddenly pick a fight with him? ???: Hmph. Kay: That sure was a tense standoff! Edgeworth: (He didn't budge an inch, even before Agent Lang...) Penny: Ah! Allow me to introduce you! This is Shaun Fenn. He's the lead actor in our movie. Edgeworth: (The lead actor... is this child?) Kay: Hi! I'm Kay Faraday. Nice to meet you! Edgeworth: And this is Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth. Shaun: .......Prosecutor? Penny: He's a pretty famous prosecutor, you know. Shaun: But he's not wearing a prosecutor's badge. Edgeworth: Gah! (He's frightfully perceptive...) Penny: Ah! Shaun, it's probably better if you didn't go over there... Shaun: ............ Edgeworth: (That's certainly not a sight a child should see... However, he is someone involved with the case. I'll need to speak with him later.) (Connecting all possible Logic, examining ground around the body, original Moozilla model and table, clearing all \"Talk\" options of Penny and Shaun, and talking with Lotta leads to:) Edgeworth: And with that, this portion of the investigation seems to be finished. Kay: So the murder weapon really is... Edgeworth: Yes. As it stands now, the possibility that it was the monster head is quite high. Kay: So he ended up being squashed by the falling head, huh... Edgeworth: Hm? Lang: Although they're extremely late to the party, the bodyguards and the police have finally arrived. Bodyguard: Mr. President! Lang: They really were... far too late. Bodyguard: Damn it! Who did this!? Lang: ...They'll pay for this. I swear I'll make them pay. But you know, this much is enough to put me at ease. The person who did this to Huang... ...I've already got my eye on a suspect. Edgeworth: What? What do you mean? Lang: Even though Huang was the victim, he doesn't have extraterritorial rights here. Your country's police have the right to investigate. However, I've already spoken with them. As an agent of Interpol, they're letting me assist in the investigation... Edgeworth: ...So they've already established a plan for this investigation? Lang: I've already found my prey. Now it's time for the hunt... ...Take a look at this. It's a printout from a security camera on the Grand Tower rooftop. Edgeworth: Th... This is! Lang: This camera records people as they get off the rooftop elevator. And guess who was recorded? The president and his killer can be clearly seen! Kay: Wh-Why is Ms. Gravelle there!? Edgeworth: (So he's saying Judge Gravelle is the murder?) Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste! Edgeworth: (Could she, who hates crime more than anyone, have...?) Security Camera Photo jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. I'd like to hear your thoughts. Lang: Lang: ............ Just now, I heard a rumor at the Grand Tower. Miles Edgeworth, that you... are no longer a \"prosecutor\". Edgeworth: ! Lang: Naturally, that means you don't even have a shred of investigate authority. So what would be the point of having a logic battle with someone like you? Edgeworth: (Hmph...!) Kay: Why would you say something like that!? Didn't you also just get reduced to being a lone agent!? Lang: .......... Hey. Answer me this. Even though you've lost your position as a \"prosecutor\"... ...why are you sticking your neck into this case? Edgeworth: ........ (Why do I still continue to investigate...?) Agent Lang... Why are you pursuing the criminal who murdered the president? Because you're an Interpol agent? Lang: .......... Edgeworth: Right now, I am also chasing after a certain person. Someone in the shadows, who was behind the murder at the Grand Tower yesterday... Someone who placed Kay in grave danger. ...Even now, they are lurking somewhere, laughing at us. We will uncover the truth, and bring them to justice... ...and a title such as \"prosecutor\" has nothing to do with it. As long as the truth remains hidden... ...I will continue to seek out that truth. For that is a part of my creed. Lang: ........Haha! You... You're always trying to be so clever, but you really are kind of an idiot. Edgeworth: (Hmph. Me, an idiot? How rude...) Lang: That's the answer I wanted to hear. ...Alright, I'll play along with you for a bit. I've lost all my men, and you've lost your title. And yet, we still continue to investigate... Let's begin this battle of logic between two kindred spirits! Edgeworth: You have my thanks... Lang: However, I won't go easy on you. I'll definitely catch the criminal who murdered Huang. And I won't let you get in my way! Edgeworth: Yes... I wouldn't have it any other way! Lang: Let me show you the truth that this wolf has sunk his fangs into! Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower. Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president! Edgeworth: It was just the two of them alone on the rooftop... No bodyguards? Lang: Yeah. I confirmed it with those bodyguards over there. They didn't know about it either. Guess he managed to give them the slip. He must've had something secret to talk about. Edgeworth: (President Huang and Judge Gravelle... Did those two have some sort of connection?) Lang: Apparently, he had an arrangement with the owner of the Grand Tower. He requested the entrance to the viewing platform be restricted so that they could be alone. Well, it's not like the owner could turn down a request from the president. Kay: Does that mean... the last person to see the president was... Lang: Exactly... Gravelle, you mean? It's gotta be her! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang's reasoning is certainly sound... However, he has overlooked one major thing...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower. Lang: Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. Lang: At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. Lang: There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang has overlooked something major...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Edgeworth: Shi-Long Lang... For the Interpol agent with the highest arrest rate to have fallen so low. Lang: What'd you say...!? Edgeworth: This is a commemorative photo taken by the staff at Global Studios. Kay: Everyone's got such great smiles! ...Well, except for Shaun. Edgeworth: This photo was taken yesterday. Lang: What!? Edgeworth: If Judge Gravelle had murdered the president two days ago... ...then his body should have been there when this photo was taken! Lang: Owwoooooooh! Lang: Heh. Perhaps you should have listened a bit more carefully to those involved in the case. Questioning witnesses is one of the basic fundamentals of an investigation, is it not? Kay: I've captured Mr. Edgeworth's great smile! You really do look most alive when you're cornering your opponent! Lang: Grr... Just as I expected. It's been a while since I've felt like this. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, haven't you been a little hasty in your reasoning? Lang: ........Tch. I don't need your advice. Lang Zi says: \"The wrath of a wolf lasts a hundred years.\" My anger towards the woman who killed the president cannot be suppressed. Edgeworth: I, too, wish to capture the culprit. However... ...there is no doubt that the body appeared here last night. Therefore... the president could not have fallen to his death. Kay: Yeah! He was crushed by the monster head! Edgeworth: The crime occurred here at the film lot, not on the rooftop of the Grand Tower. Lang: Lang: So, that's what you think. Still, I don't intend to stray from my logic either. Edgeworth: However, he could not have fallen to his death two nights ago. This photo proves that... Lang: Is that so? Think about it this way... Two nights ago, Gravelle pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body. Edgeworth: In here? Lang: Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Once we search this area, we'll know where she hid the body. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Unfortunately, there is no need for a search. Lang: What'd you say!? Edgeworth: This piece of evidence proves that Judge Gravelle could not have hidden the body! Edgeworth: All the entrances to the film lot were locked. The chain on the back entrance was only cut last night. Lang: What!? Edgeworth: Therefore, Judge Gravelle could not have entered the film lot two nights ago! Lang: Aiyaaaaa! But the president could only have fallen two nights ago! Edgeworth: ...Why are you so insistent that the crime occurred two days ago? Lang: Why...? Because there's still more to the security camera footage. Lang: A photo was recorded 10–20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman. That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone. After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all! There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there? Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is! Edgeworth: The president never came down from the rooftop? Lang: That's right. The security camera is always watching the entrance of the elevator. It was specifically set up to record anyone who entered or exited the rooftop. Essentially, the camera created a locked room... one which the president vanished from! Edgeworth: (A locked room... I see. This is quite an unfavorable piece of evidence for Judge Gravelle...) Security Camera Photo data updated in my Organizer. Kay: A rooftop escape! That's a difficult feat! Edgeworth: So even the Yatagarasu can't just fly through the sky. Kay: That's right. I... I still need more training to be able to pull that off. Edgeworth: (Are you saying you're going to train yourself to fly?) Lang: A photo was recorded 10–20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman. Lang: That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone. Lang: After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all! Lang: There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there? Lang: Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is! Edgeworth: (A locked room created by the security camera... Is falling off the roof really the only way to escape this locked room?) Edgeworth: As a matter of fact, there was one. A hidden route... that is. Lang: A way down without using the elevator!? You'd better not tell me he flew off or something! Edgeworth: There's no need for that. It's quite simple. The president just needed to know... ...about the existence of the hidden 51st floor. Lang: The 51st floor? Edgeworth: This building has a hidden 51st floor. It is accessible through a secret hatch on the rooftop. Using that route, it would be possible to leave the rooftop without using the elevator. Lang: Lang: Hidden room? Secret hatch? How could the president have even known about that? Edgeworth: I wonder? I don't know the answer myself. I am merely raising a possibility. Lang: In the first place, what's this all about? This hidden 51st floor. Sounds like something that ninja girl over there would love to get into! Kay: No way! I'm sick of that place! Edgeworth: (For Kay, that place only holds bad memories, after all.) The 51st floor was a secret storeroom for the black market auction. Its true purpose was only exposed yesterday. Lang: ...Black market auction? You... You aren't suggesting the president was involved in something like that, are you? Edgeworth: I have no proof. However, the possibility exists, does it not? Kay: Hmm. I wouldn't put it past that president. Lang: HOOOOOOOOOOWWWL! Kay: Eek! Lang: Impossible! The president would never...! He would never be involved in a black market auction! Edgeworth: (Wh... What's this?) Lang: You punks. Are you prepared? If you're gonna spout nonsense like that... I'll tear you into pieces! Kay: Eeeeeek! Edgeworth: (...She ran away.) Lang: You don't have any idea! The amount of respect that man has earned from his country's people! Edgeworth: (I see... We have seen the president's true colors. However, the people of Zheng Fa remain in the dark... Should I inform Agent Lang of the president's true nature? No. Telling him now would only further cloud his judgment...) I understand, Agent Lang. Please calm down. We spoke out of line... I apologize. Lang: ......Sorry. My emotions got the best of me. And Kay, how long do you plan on hiding? You can come out now. Kay: ...I'm sorry. Lang: ...It's fine. My anger is directed towards the president's killer. Lotta: Well, I'll be! Yer actually a pretty good guy, ain't ya? That loyalty to yer president! It's mighty admirable! Lang: Heh. What's it to you? Lotta: Aww, don't be like that. I've got some good news for ya, I reckon. Lang: What? Lotta: The president ain't never passed through the 51st floor. Ya can count on me! Lang: Really? Lotta: I was in the storeroom myself, and I saw it with my very own eyes! Edgeworth: (That's right... She snuck into the storeroom that day.) Lotta's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer. Lang: ...Thanks. ...Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: What is it? Lang: I don't intend to give the culprit a single step of leeway. No one's seen the president since he met with Gravelle two days ago. Edgeworth: That doesn't change the fact that the body wasn't here yesterday. If he were pushed off two days ago, it would be odd that he wasn't found until yesterday. I doubt a fall from the rood would take a whole day. Lang: I'll admit, there are a few things I still haven't figured out. Edgeworth: Regardless... there is one thing I am certain of. Kay: There is? Edgeworth: What exactly occurred here last night? I'm certain we'll have to look into that in order to uncover the truth. Kay: Because the body and the hoofprints could have only appeared last night, right? Officer: Agent Lang! We'd like to bring the body in for the autopsy... Lang: Huang..... It's in your hands. Make sure you show the proper respect. Officer: I also have one more thing to report... Lang: What is it? Officer: We found some footprints near the body! Umm... They were left within the area that looks like a monster's footprint. Edgeworth: (There were human footprints within the monster's footprint?) Lang: What kind of footprints? Officer: Sir! They were the footprints of a child! About the size of an elementary school student! Edgeworth: What!? Penny: Huh!? Kay: A-An elementary school student!? Wait... Could it be...? Edgeworth: (Who... was that?) Penny: U-Umm...! Edgeworth: (Ms. Nichols?) Penny: I... I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you! Please excuse my rudeness! Edgeworth: Is there something you want to say? (What is she so scared of?) Penny: I'm worried that you'll think poorly of me, but... ...please let me testify something! It's really important! Edgeworth: (That's not something you need to be so worried about...) What is it? Penny: Last night... I... I actually came here. Lang: What!? Penny: Eek! Edgeworth: Why did you come here? Penny: ...Well, I got a little worried, so I stopped by... ...to check up on Shaun. Edgeworth: Shaun... You mean Shaun Fenn? (As I thought...) Penny: Yes. Last night, umm... Shaun stayed here late in order to practice by myself. Kay: Wow! He's really dedicated! Penny: Well, this movie is the first time he's starring as the lead role, so... ...I'm sure he wants to do his best...! Edgeworth: (She must have witnessed something last night...) When was this? Penny: Umm... If I remember correctly, I think it was a little past 10 PM. It looked like it was going to rain, and I was getting worried, so I came to check up on him. And when I got here... Well... I, umm... Lang: You... saw something? Penny: .....Y-Yes. Shaun was practicing by himself... ...and right above his head... I saw... a long... long... neck. Kay: A neck? Penny: Y-Yes! Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile... It was like... the neck of a dinosaur! Lotta: Whooooooahhh there! C-Could that've been... ...G-G-Gourdy!? Last time I went huntin' for it, it was a bust... but I reckon, this could be the real deal! Kay: What!? So this time it's Gourdy!? Penny: Th-That's right! I was really surprised! A-After all, Shaun is the boy who can communicate with Moozilla! Lotta: Yeah! That's right! Them horns of his lets him hear what the monster's sayin', right? Penny: E-Even so! He was looking up at Gourdy's face and he was talking to it! It was like they were friends! D-Doesn't that sound weird!? Lotta: You said it, sister! That's pretty darn strange, I reckon! That boy's a little traitor! Edgeworth: (...It seems she's gotten reality mixed up with the movies...) Lang: Hey, Missy... Did you really see that? Penny: Yes! But I was so shocked, I immediately ran home after that. Lang: What do you make of this, Mr. Prosecutor? Has another monster taken the stage? Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Do you really believe this absurd testimony? Lang: Hahahahaha! I couldn't care less about the monsters. However, it looks like who we need to talk to next has been decided now, hasn't it? Edgeworth: Shaun Fenn... He was here last night. It's very likely he saw something... isn't it? Lang: Atta boy! Lang: Shaun Fenn...! We've got some questions for you! ................ Penny: U-Umm... Shaun kind of left a while ago. Lang: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Kay: L-Let's go after him! Lang: Tch! Where'd he run off to!? Edgeworth: He might have just gone back home. Kay: That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today! Lang: ...Or he may have run away. Kay: A-Aren't you just overthinking things? Edgeworth: He's still a child. I can't imagine that he could have murdered the president by himself. Lang: Who said he was alone? Maybe that monster helped him. That boy can summon a monster to his aid, right? Edgeworth: Hmph. Very funny. Lang: I'm not saying that kid's definitely the culprit. But right now, he's the most prominent witness we have, So, we'll need to find that brat. Gumshoe: Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Kay: Ah! Gummy! Gumshoe: Uuugh... I, I... I...! Kay: He ran away... Edgeworth: (What is the detective doing...?) Lang: It doesn't matter... It's not like I can rely on this country's police anyways. Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. Do you intend to continue investigating by yourself? Lang: Yeah. That's right. You got a problem with that? Kay: Didn't you always have a small army of subordinates with you before? Lang: That's right... But, you know, being a lone wolf isn't all that bad. You don't have to worry about your subordinates or partners. All you need are your fangs. Simple, right? Edgeworth: (Subordinates... and partners...?) Lang: Well then. I'll be seeing you two. Lotta: He he he he. Things are gettin' interestin'! I reckon I'm about to get real busy myself! After all, I got me a pair of monsters to hunt! I'm definitely gettin' my hands on this scoop! Kay: Things have gotten pretty crazy, haven't they? Edgeworth: Indeed. There's the footprints of Moozilla, and now the shadow of Gourdy... It's almost exactly like the movie. Kay: How about we go monster hunting too? Edgeworth: Well... (Hm? Isn't that...?) Kay: Isn't that one of Lang's men...? Edgeworth: (He's one of Agent Lang's subordinates. We met him during another case.) Excuse me... MIB: Oh, Prosecutor Edgeworth. It has been a while. Kay: Shouldn't you be following Mr. Lang? MIB: Agent Lang... Shifu... is no longer my boss. Edgeworth: What exactly happened? MIB: Do you remember the incident from one month ago? Edgeworth: (The \"Yatagarasu Incident\" we had been involved with.) MIB: Agent Lang made a major mistake back then. He almost aided and abetted a dangerous criminal. Edgeworth: (Certainly... it had come quite close to that at the time.) MIB: Shifu took responsibility for what happened... and our team was disbanded. Kay: Disbanded...? Edgeworth: So that's what Agent Lang was talking about when he said he had become a lone wolf. Kay: Then... Why are you here? MIB: That's..... Well. I was a little worried about Shifu. ...It seems that even now, he's still chasing after them. The ghosts of 12 years past... Edgeworth: Ghosts of 12 years past? Just what are you... MIB: .......... I'm sorry. I've already said too much. If you'll excuse me... Edgeworth: (These ghosts Agent Lang is chasing after... Do they also have something to do with this case?) Kay: Looks like everyone's left now... So, what do we do now? Edgeworth: Well... Ms. Hart is going after the monsters, and Agent Lang is going after Shaun. We should also try approaching this case from a different angle. Kay: What angle would that be? Edgeworth: ...We should listen to what Judge Gravelle has to say. Kay: Ah! That's right! If I'm not mistaken, Ms. Gravelle is... Gravelle: ...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Fifi Laguarde's trial. Kay: She said that she had a trial coming up! Edgeworth: Indeed. Let's head to the courthouse as well. Kay: 'Kay! To be continued. Gravelle: Court is now in session. Is the defense ready? Ray: Of course, Your Honor! We can begin whenever you want. Franziska: The prosecution has been ready from the start, Your Honor. Edgeworth: Jill Crane, the attorney in charge of the defense, has passed on from this world. Furthermore, Sebastian Debeste, the prosecutor-in-charge, has disappeared... And so, Franziska and Mr. Shields have taken over their duties. Gravelle: Before we begin, I would like to apologize for the delay of today's trial. As the crime took place in the prison, a place where justice is normally administered... ...and the defendant was the warden of the prison, further exacerbating the situation... ...additional time was specially arranged to investigate and prepare for the trial. In addition, the defense attorney in charge of the case, Jill Crane, has recently passed away... Due to these circumstances, the trial was further delayed. Mr. Shields, Ms. von Karma. At this time, I'd like to give you my gratitude for taking up this responsibility on short notice. Ray: I guess this is the last job Gravelle-pie's friend left behind for us, huh? Well, Uncle Ray's more than happy to help out. Although having said that, I only had enough time to skim through the case files... Are you OK on your end, Franny-pie? Franziska: What kind of prosecutor abandons his own case and vanishes without a trace...!? I won't allow any more delays in this trial while we wait for that foolish man to return. I have received the evidence just now. There should be no problem continuing the trial. Gravelle: ...You have my thanks. And with that, I hereby call the defendant, Fifi Laguarde, to the stand. Laguarde: ........ Gravelle: Now then, will the prosecution please give us their opening statement? Franziska: Very well, Your Honor. The defendant... Laguarde: ...Please wait, Your Honor. Gravelle: What is it? Laguarde: Well, there's something I'd like you to fill me in on. Just what exactly... am I doing in a place like this? Gravelle: Then perhaps... you would do well to listen to the opening statement. Laguarde: Hmm. So if I listen to it, I'll get it, huh? OK then, let's hear it. Franziska: ...That was the plan from the start. Now, if you would kindly shut up and listen. The incident occurred in the detention center and the prison Warden Laguarde is in charge of. The victim is Horace Knightley, who was being held in the detention center. The prosecution is certain that this woman here is the culprit. This knife, the murder weapon, is the decisive evi..... Huh!? Gravelle: Ms. von Karma. Is something wrong? Franziska: Th-That's... impossible! The evidence is...! Ray: What's wrong with the evidence, Franny-pie? Franziska: The evidence... the knife's gone! The chisel with Kanis's bell attached to it is missing too! Ray: Wh... Whaaat!? Gravelle: Order! Order! Prosecutor von Karma. What is the meaning of this? Franziska: I... I don't understand it either, Your Honor. Laguarde: If there's no evidence, then I suppose there's not much reason for me to be here. Some prosecutor. Can't even hold on to one little piece of evidence. What a dunce. Franziska: I... I only received everything that the previous prosecutor had... Ah! Ray: ...It appears the culprit is that pampered prosecutor, the Boy Blunder. Hey, Gravelle-pie. Gravelle: What is it? Ray: Your Honor! Considering our predicament, what say we postpone the trial until later? Gravelle: Gravelle: The defense's proposal is overruled. Ray: Eh? Gravelle-pie...? Laguarde: I know, right? It'd be troubling for me if this trial were to be delayed any further. I just want everyone to know that I'm innocent. As soon as possible. Franziska: Franziska: Innocent!? I've had more than enough of your foolish... Laguarde: And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... \"In court, evidence is everything.\" Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor? Gravelle: .......... That is correct. Franziska: Eh! Ray: What!? Gravelle: The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Fifi Laguarde... Ray: Ray: Hold your horses, Gravelle-pie! You can't just declare her innocent all of a sudden! Gravelle: Is something the matter? For the defense to object to a \"not guilty\" verdict... Ray: Well, I mean... Even you must know that the warden over there is guilty, right? You were there with us when we found the murder weapon! Gravelle: ........ Mr. Shields. A judge must remain impartial when handing down a verdict. That is why I cannot allow myself to get caught up in my own personal feelings... The person who was present when the murder weapon was discovered... ...and the judge sitting before you now, are two completely different people. Ray: ...You're kidding, right? Gravelle: I can only hand down a verdict based upon the evidence that was presented. Franziska: Franziska: There is evidence! It's just... Well, it's not here right now, but... A few minutes, that's all I need! I'll find the evidence and return to court, without fail! The prosecution requests a brief recess, Your Honor! Gravelle: ........ Ray: Th-The defense would also like a recess, Your Honor. Gravelle-pie. Please... Gravelle: ........ ...I understand. I shall grant your request. Laguarde: Well! Verity-darling! Aren't you wishy-washy today? Gravelle: This court will now adjourn for a 15 minute recess! During with, the prosecution and the defense shall prepare for the resumption of the trial. Franziska: ...Understood, Your Honor. Ray: Phew. That was a close one. Gravelle: Court is now adjourned! Kay: Didn't we find it together!? The evidence! Edgeworth: Yes, we certainly did. Gumshoe: Huh? Edgeworth: What's the matter, Detective? Gumshoe: It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator. Kay: Really! Why? Edgeworth: (Of course, that's why the metal detector reacted!) Judge Gravelle, I'd like you to take a look at this. Gravelle: The chisel...? Debeste: Wasn't that just the fake murder weapon? Edgeworth: Kanis hid this chisel inside this dog's mouth. And the real murder weapon was hidden in very much the same way... Laguarde: ...! Edgeworth: The real murder weapon is in the pond, inside the alligator! Edgeworth: I wonder if it was stolen by someone... ???: Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Ms. Berry and Mr. Saint. Did you come to attend the trial? Regina: I came because I heard there's a really fun show around here! So, where is it? Simeon: The trial for the case I got caught up in was supposed to have already started, but... ..our practice ran a little late. I believe it was somewhere around here, wasn't it? Kay: Actually, two key pieces of evidence have gone missing: the chisel and the knife... The trial is in recess now. Sort of like an intermission. You just missed it, Simeon. Simeon: Wha... Whaaaaaat!? Wh-wh-wh-what's that supposed to mean!? Regina: Ah ha ha! Looks like Simeon's going to get arrested again! Simeon: Eeeeeeeeeek! Nowaynowaynoway, I can't...! Kay: Hmm. I guess Simeon is his usual noisy self. ...Huh? ???: To think that I would be humiliated like this! Edgeworth: ...And here comes another noisy individual. Ray: Now, now, Franny-pie. Let's just take a moment and calm down a bit. Maybe you could put that whip of yours away, him? Whaddaya say? Franziska: That foolish prosecutor! When I get my hands on him... ...my whip is going to give him the thrashing of a lifetime! Ray: Eek! Miles, why don't you try talking to her? Edgeworth: (Good grief... On that note, I guess I should probably hear what she has to say.) (Clearing all \"Talk\" options of Franziska and Ray leads to:) Ray: If only there were someone who could go search for the evidence for us... ........ Edgeworth: ........ .....Very well. I'll go look for them. Ray: Oh! Miles! You'd do that for us? Edgeworth: Of course, finding the evidence within fifteen minutes will be no easy task. Ray: Well, if worse comes to worst, Uncle Ray and Franny-pie will help you stall for time. Franziska: .......... Ray: Until you recover the evidence, we won't let her hand down a verdict. Edgeworth: Please do so. ...Franziska, are you OK with this? Franziska: .....You're asking me, Franziska von Karma, to help you out? You'd be better off spending the rest of your life as an anchorman for the local news... Ray: Ms. von Karma. This is an emergency. We could really use your cooperation. Franziska: ! Hmph... I understand. As acting prosecutor, I, along with that attorney over there, shall continue this trial. Meanwhile, you, the \"former\" prosecutor shall run around and look for the evidence... ...all for my sake. It's a job that suits you perfectly! Edgeworth: ...I'm glad that you're on board. Simeon: I-I'll help out too! ...'Cause I really don't wanna get arrested again. Regina: This sounds like fun! Regina wants to tag along too! Edgeworth: Alright. That would be helpful. Now then, where should we begin? Kay: I think we should go find that person, and hear what they have to say! Edgeworth: Who should we talk to in order to learn where the evidence went? Edgeworth: Yes. The person in charge of the evidence was Sebastian Debeste. Simeon: Ah, you mean that rookie prosecutor, right? Got it! Edgeworth: I'll leave him to you. Ray: Alright. Time for Uncle Ray to have a strategy meeting with the opposing counsel. ...Just the two of uUUAAAGH! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... You better not keep me waiting. Lest you end up like your friend here. Edgeworth: Yes.... I'll keep that in mind. Ray: Franny-pie, wait for meeeee! Edgeworth: Now then, let's go help look for Sebastian as well. Kay: Ah! Edgeworth: (Judge Gravelle...) Gravelle: ...If it isn't Prosecutor Edgeworth. I hope that all is well. Kay: All is NOT well! Just what was going on in that trial earlier...? Edgeworth: Kay! There's no need for that. Kay: But...! Even though Ms. Gravelle should know exactly who the culprit is... What made you...? Gravelle: ........ In a court of law, the only thing that truly matters is evidence... Whatever my own feelings may be, it should not affect the verdict. Edgeworth: So, is this the \"Judge persona\" of Verity Gravelle we're seeing? Gravelle: Cold-blooded and heartless... It's fine if you think of me as such. Edgeworth: (Even as a judge, she's still this stubborn?) Judge Gravelle. There's just... one thing I'd like to ask you. Gravelle: And what would that be? Edgeworth: Two nights ago... you went to the roof of the Grand Tower. Gravelle: ! The roof... you say? Edgeworth: You met with the president there, correct? The two of you were caught on the security camera. Gravelle: Is there some sort of problem with that? Edgeworth: Today... The president's body was discovered. Very close to the Grand Tower. Gravelle: Th-That's...! Edgeworth: You understand now, don't you? You're a suspect. ...What happened between you and the president up on the roof? Gravelle: Nothing... We merely spoke for a few minutes. Once our business was done, I headed straight home. I took the elevator back down alone. Edgeworth: Indeed. That was shown on the security camera footage as well. What exactly did you and the president talk about? Gravelle: Th-That... I cannot say. Edgeworth: (I see. However, I cannot afford to let up just yet. That being the case... Heh. I guess my only remaining options is to use that. She is definitely hiding something...! And I'm going to draw it out of her!) Edgeworth: Two nights ago, Judge Gravelle met with President Huang... Gravelle: ........ Gravelle: ...It is true that I spoke with President Huang on the roof of the Grand Tower. However, we only discussed business. There is no need to tell you what was said. Edgeworth: Hmm... Just like in the trial earlier, she won't reveal her personal feelings easily. When she's speaking as a judge, it would be better for me to wait and see what develops. Now then, I'll start by asking her what she talked about with the president! Edgeworth: Could you tell me... what you and the president talked about? Gravelle: My meeting with the president was strictly business. And since it has nothing to do with you, I am not obligated to answer your question. Edgeworth: ...... Gravelle: I appreciate your understanding. Edgeworth: Even so... You certainly are a very busy person, aren't you? You're a member of the P.I.C. and a judge as well. You even assist with the investigations. Gravelle: I am simply fulfilling the professional duties that have been assigned to me. Edgeworth: Was your meeting with the president also one of the duties assigned to you as a judge? Gravelle: .....Yes. Of course it was. I... am one who lives for the law. I would never act outside my professional duties. Edgeworth: This morning, you returned Kay's \"promise notebook\" to me. I don't believe that all of yours actions are simply done for the sake of your duties. Gravelle: .....It's true, it seems I still retain some immature qualities. Edgeworth: I wouldn't call it immature. It was your own personal kindness. Weren't you also distressed when you found out the president had passed away? Gravelle: Yes... It is very unfortunate... Why did he have to die...? Edgeworth: It seems he was crushed by the head of a monster called the \"Mighty Moozilla\". Ah... Excuse me. You see, Moozilla is... Gravelle: I-Is that true!? You mean... the president died at the temporary Moozilla film lot...? Edgeworth: Yes. That's right... I'm surprised that you know about Moozilla. Gravelle: Y-Yes... I had heard about it from Sebastian. He told me that the movie was being filmed near the Grand Tower... Edgeworth: ...She seems awfully shaken up about that. And I'm also curious about Sebastian, who went missing along with the evidence. She said she wouldn't talk about the president... However, I might be able to get her to reveal her secret through another line of questioning. She is flustered beyond normal. There must be some reason behind it! Edgeworth: Franziska may have taken over the prosecution in Sebastian's place, however... ...as long as he still possesses some of the evidence, the trial cannot proceed. Gravelle: I intend to carry out a fair trial. If the prosecution is unable to present evidence... the defendant must be declared not guilty. Edgeworth: ...... Gravelle: I am a judge. I cannot allow my own personal feelings to get in the way. Edgeworth: So, you're saying you're not the least bit worried about Sebastian's whereabouts? Gravelle: Of course... I am... I am worried about Sebastian, as well, but... Edgeworth: You're worried about Sebastian \"as well\"? Wouldn't that mean... ...that there is someone else you're worried about? Gravelle: Ah...! Edgeworth: By any chance... would that person have something to do with your unnatural behavior? Gravelle: ...That's impossible. I... ...I am a follower of the law... I will not... be swayed by... personal feelings. Edgeworth: It may be true that those who stand in court have a duty to follow the law. However, we're not superheroes! You and I are only human. It is impossible to completely ignore your own feelings and render an impartial judgement! Gravelle: Aaaaaaah! .....It is as you say. As I am now... I cannot hand down an impartial verdict. Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Why don't you tell me the truth? Gravelle: I... I...! Just what am I supposed to do...!? Edgeworth: For Judge Gravelle to become this distraught... I should find out exactly who she is searching for. Up until now, she has been wearing the mask of a judge... This time, I should be able to draw out her true feelings! Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: Earlier, when Moozilla was brought up, it seemed to be a sensitive topic for you... Is that \"child\" you spoke of involved with the Moozilla movie? Gravelle: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! H-How!? How do you know that...!? Edgeworth: You're usually so calm, yet you seem rather distraught right now. Please, tell me... Who is that child!? Gravelle: ...I understand. If you've come to know this much... I shall prepare myself for the worst. The child I'm searching for... is a boy by the name of Shaun Fenn. Edgeworth: Shaun...? Why do you want to know his whereabouts? Gravelle: Well... That much, I simply cannot say... Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Didn't you say you were prepared for the worst!? Gravelle: .....! Edgeworth: Even if you don't intend to talk, I am determined to expose the truth. ...That is my resolve. Why is she searching for Shaun... I must get her to tell me the reason. Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: I don't know what kind of relationship you have with Shaun... ...but at the very least, the two of you must be acquaintances! Gravelle: E... Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Won't you allow us to help you in your search for him? Gravelle: Help...? No, that won't be allowed? Edgeworth: Who won't allow it? The so-called Goddess of Law? Gravelle: ...The person who knows where that child is.. Edgeworth: I see... Finally, I've connected all the pieces of the puzzle. The reason why you cannot easily talk about Shaun... It was because... Someone kidnapped him, isn't that right? Gravelle: A-Aah... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: ...Judge Gravelle. I would like to hear the truth from your own lips. Gravelle: .....I understand. This time... I will truly be prepared for the worst. It is just as you deduced... Someone has kidnapped Shaun. Edgeworth: ! As I thought... There was a kidnapping! Still, how is Shaun's kidnapping related to you in any way? Gravelle: ......Shaun and I are... ...mother and child... Edgeworth: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? I was unable to learn much about the conversation she had with the president, but... ...I have learned of Shaun's kidnapping. ...It was an unexpected result, but with that... it's checkmate. Gravelle: ....... Kay: Whaaat!? J-Shaun is... Ms. Gravelle's son!? No way! I mean, he's already so big, for him to be your... Gravelle: Yes... Shaun is indeed my son. Please look at this... Edgeworth: (This is a clipping from a magazine...) Kay: It's an article about Shaun! Do you always carry this around with you? Gravelle: Yes. I always keep it close by. It's like a charm to me... Edgeworth: (It seems the bond that they share is a strong one.) Gravelle: ....... Edgeworth: However, are you absolutely certain that he's been kidnapped? Gravelle: Yes. I received a call from the kidnapper just before the trial started... Edgeworth: What were their demands? Gravelle: They had only one demand. A \"Not Guilty\" verdict for Fifi Laguarde... Edgeworth: (I see. So that's what happened...) Laguarde: And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... \"In court, evidence is everything.\" Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor? Gravelle: .......... That is correct. The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Fifi Laguarde... Edgeworth: So, that's why you were going to deliver a \"Not Guilty\" verdict earlier? Gravelle: I am... not qualified to be a judge... A judge must be able to remain impartial and composed, above all else. And yet... despite this, in the trial just now, I... ...I was about to hand down a verdict that was led solely by my heart! Edgeworth: .....Judge Gravelle. Gravelle: The Goddess of Law must be furious with me... ...but, I simply couldn't do it. I couldn't hand down a fair verdict... if it meant I had to sacrifice my own son! Kay: Of course you can't! Edgeworth: (Kay...) Kay: A real parent... would never abandon their own child! If that makes the Goddess of Law angry, then maybe the Goddess is the one who's wrong! The Goddess is guilty! Guilty! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Indeed. (To declare a goddess guilty...) We're responsible for upholding the law, but at the same time, we are only human. Nobody would hand down a verdict that would sacrifice their own child. Gravelle: .....Thank you very much. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth. However... I cannot simply run away from the courtroom. Bailiff: Judge Gravelle! So this is where you've been. Gravelle: It appears it's time... Kay: .......... Ms. Gravelle! ...My father, he was a prosecutor. Gravelle: Your father...? Kay: Yes. He stood in court, just like you. ...And now, with all that has happened, it got me thinking... What if, my father had been in the same position as you are now? Gravelle: If a prosecutor was being coerced into obtaining a guilty verdict... Kay: I know... if my life were on the line, my father... ...would definitely come to steal me back! Gravelle: Steal you... back? Kay: Ms. Gravelle. Why don't you let us take care of it? Gravelle: What...? Kay: I'm gonna go steal Shaun back for you! As the second Yatagarasu, I, Kay Faraday, give you my word! Gravelle: ...... Edgeworth: (Heh. So, the Great Thief Yatagarasu plans to steal the \"truth\", huh...) What say you, Judge Gravelle? Will you place your trust in our young Great Thief? Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth... Edgeworth: And, if it's alright with you, I wish to help as well. Gravelle: .....Thank you very much. I know that it's really not my place to ask this of you... ...but please... do whatever you can... Please save Shaun. Kay: You got it! Just leave everything to us! Gravelle: Allow me to leave my cellphone with you. You may get a call from the kidnapper at some point. Edgeworth: You have my word. I will ensure the safe return of your phone, alone with your son. Gravelle: And I will do everything in my power to prolong the trial. But... even then, at most the trial can only last for about two more hours... Edgeworth: (Two hours, huh... So, until 2 PM. That's our time frame...) Gravelle: ...I must return to court. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall leave the rest to you. Edgeworth: Heh. Kay, I thought you were taking a break from being the Great Thief? Kay: As of right now, the Great Thief Yatagarasu is back in business! Alright! Time to put on the gloves and hit the pavement! It's my first request, after all! Edgeworth: Is that so? In that case, we'd better begin our investigation posthaste... ...if we hope to track down Shaun... Lang: Tch! Where'd he run off to!? Edgeworth: He might have just gone back home. Kay: That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today! Lang: ...Or he may have run away. Edgeworth: We should probably begin our investigation from the front of the Grand Tower. Kay: H-Hey! Hold it, Mr. Edgeworth! You're not the one in charge anymore! From here on out, this is a job for a Great Thief! Which means, I'm the leader now! Edgeworth: ...If that's the case, then what am I supposed to do? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, you get to be... the first ever Great Thief's Assistant! Edgeworth: (So, I'm a thief's assistant now...?) Kay: Alright! Let's get going! The Great Thief Yatagarasu takes flight once again! Kay: Here we are! The scene of the crime! Let's get to work! Now, say it with me, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hm? Say what? Kay: \"Even in the depths of night...\" Edgeworth: .......... Kay: Aww, come on! Say the rest with me! Edgeworth: And just why should I do that!? Kay: Because! The Great Thief Yatagarasu has arrived on the scene! If we don't say the introduction, it just doesn't feel right! Edgeworth: I have no intention of becoming a thief. Kay: Aargh! Fine, then. I'll do it by myself! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: Yes, Kay. I know you are. I, on the other hand, am starting the investigation. Kay: Tch. You're no fun. Edgeworth: ...We don't have time for \"fun\". We only have until 2 o'clock. We need to begin making inquiries immediately. Kay: Good thing we have a photo, so we can go right ahead and start asking around! (Examining trailer after clearing all \"Talk\" options of Powers, blue truck, taxi, and film equipment and talking with officer leads to:) Edgeworth: (Hmm. It's already half past 12...) Kay: I wonder how Ms. Gravelle and the others are holding up... Edgeworth: How long will they be able to prolong the trial...? Kay: We gotta hurry and find Shaun! Edgeworth: Indeed. Lotta: Aww heck naw! That ain't how it's done! Ya ain't gonna catch a scoop like that! Nicole: S-Sorry, Chief! Lotta: What am I always tellin' ya!? We're beasts! Scoop-eatin' animals! It's scoop or starve! No story, no glory! Ya gotta get fired up! Nicole: Yessir! As expected of my mentor! Edgeworth: They're here... (It's those noisy reporters.) Kay: Hey, they came here too! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go talk to them! Edgeworth: ...Good grief. If we must. Edgeworth: What if the kidnappers stole the box? Kay: Ah! You mean they...! Edgeworth: Exactly. They took it in order to carry Shaun inside it. Kay: Shaun's a tiny kid, after all. Then, the reason the taxi driver didn't see Shaun was because... Edgeworth: It's likely he was put in the trunk as the kidnapper's luggage. Kay: But, why did they need to go through all the trouble of hiding him? Edgeworth: At first, the kidnappers must have intended to abduct him without being seen. However, they didn't anticipate all the policemen in the plaza. Kay: Ah, I see. If they tried to just walk away with him, they would've been spotted... Edgeworth: Just the mere presence of policemen would have been a sizable threat. Kay: I geddit! In that case, we've gotta ask the taxi driver! Edgeworth: Did the two men you told us about earlier have any luggage with them? Driver: Yeah. They stuffed a huge box into the trunk. Kay: Then that's that! Those guys must be the kidnappers! Edgeworth: Do you remember where you took those men? Driver: Sounds to me like something serious has gone down here... If you'd like, I could take you to the same place I took them. Kay: Let's do it, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes. Thank you for your help. Driver: No problemo! Just leave it to me! Kay: Uugh... That taxi drove way too fast. I don't feel too good. Edgeworth: ........ Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, are you alright? Your face is really pale. Edgeworth: I-I'm fine. The driver said they came to this house's garage... Kay: This must be where those two men brought the box! ...Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Look at the nameplate on the door! Edgeworth: Nameplate...? What!? \"Blaise Debeste\"!? Kay: So this is... the chairman's house! Edgeworth: (Does that mean the one who kidnapped Shaun was Blaise Debeste? Blaise should have already been arrested though...) Kay: Ah! The garage door is unlocked! Edgeworth: You really do have a good eye for this sort of thing... Edgeworth: (It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.) Kay: Excuse me... we're coming in... Anybody home? Edgeworth: Doing something like this, it's as if we're a couple of petty thieves...! Kay: Shh! Be quiet! Right now, we're Great Thieves! Have some self-awareness! Edgeworth: (...She scolded me.) Nobody's here... For now, it looks like we can get through this without being arrested. Kay: This isn't the time to be relieved! Now the real deal begins! Let's go look for treasure! Edgeworth: (We are looking for Shaun, not treasure...) (Examining the \"Cement bag\", \"Shovel and sledgehammer\", \"Gloves\" and \"Green box\" leads to:) ???: ...*thump, thump*... Edgeworth: Hm? Kay: Th-There's someone inside! ???: ...*thump, thump*... *thump, thump*... *CRASH*! Edgeworth: Is it... Shaun...? Kay: Shaun! We're coming to save you! ......Eh? Edgeworth: (Th-This is...!) You're..... S-Sebastian! Kay: Whaaaaat!? Why!? Debeste: Nnnnf, Nmmnnnmmf! Kay: This is Blaise's house, right? That would mean... Edgeworth: Yes. It should also be Sebastian's house. (So then, why is he...?) Kay, go help him out. Kay: If it has to do with ropes, just leave it to Kay! Here I go! A little pull over here, and a quick tug over there! Are you alright, Sebastian? Debeste: .......... Edgeworth: (He looks a little worse for wear.) Why were you tied up in a place like this? Debeste: .....How should I know!? Y-You guys don't know anything about me! Edgeworth: .....It's because we don't know. That's why we're asking you... Debeste: .......... Kay: He's completely shut off his heart... Edgeworth: Indeed... If it's come to this... ...I suppose I have no choice but to use that. Kay: Ah! You mean! Edgeworth: I hate to do this when he's in such a fragile state. It's like kicking a man who's down... Kay: ...Will it be alright? His mind might break if you corner him too much, y'know? Edgeworth: Yes. I am aware of that. I will try to be careful. (Good grief. I wonder how this will turn out... I've never held back against anyone before...) Edgeworth: After running out of the meeting room this morning, why would he be here of all places...? Debeste: You guys... You don't know how I feel! Edgeworth: (He's gone through a lot of shock. He must be on the verge of an emotional meltdown.) It can't be helped... At times like this, I must quietly listen to what he has to say. Debeste: N-No one tells me anything... I'm always the only one being left out like an idiot...! Edgeworth: (Hmm... I should try to answer his questions as best as I can.) Considering how fragile he is... I won't have much time to spare. I'll need to ask about his true feelings, and try to calm him down posthaste! Edgeworth: Could you please tell me what's on your mind? Debeste: I... I don't wanna! It's not like you'd listen to me anyways! Edgeworth: ..... Debeste: Wh-What's wrong? Normally, you'd be shouting \"Objection!\" right about now! Edgeworth: ..... Debeste: ...You're serious? Y-You're really... gonna listen to what I have to say? Edgeworth: I can understand... the shock you went through after what happened with your father. Debeste: It wasn't just Pops. This morning, I... I lost everything! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: E-Everything I have... was given to me by Pops... T-Tell me, Mr. Edgeworth... Just what am I supposed to believe in...? Edgeworth: If you can't believe in others, then at least believe in yourself. You'll need to gain experience on your own, but if you require wisdom, I can lend you a hand. Debeste: ! ...Ever since I got locked up, I've been thinking... ...am I too inculpable to be a prosecutor... uh? Incapable...? Erm, which one was it? Edgeworth: I believe \"incapable\" is the word you are looking for. Judging your own ability is not an easy task. Sebastian. Little by little, you are growing. Debeste: ! Edgeworth: Sebastian. Would you tell me your side of the story? Debeste: .....I-I understand. What... should I talk about? Edgeworth: Hmm. He seems to have calmed down slightly. I'd like you to tell me everything you know about the kidnappers. Now then... Tell me what you heard and saw! Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: Kidnapping his own son in order to demand a ransom wouldn't make such sense. Debeste: .....Y-Yeah, you're right! Edgeworth: Did you notice anything strange when you got kidnapped? Debeste: Oooh... As soon as I answered their question, they just took me away... Edgeworth: They asked you a question...? Tell me what they asked you! Debeste: Waaah! D-Don't glare at me like that... Erm... I think they asked me, \"Do you know Gravelle?\" Edgeworth: ! I see.. The pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall into place. Blaise... and the kidnappers did not intend to kidnap you. Their objective was Shaun Fenn. They were planning to kidnap Judge Gravelle's son... ...in order to have Fifi Laguarde declared not guilty! Debeste: J-Verity has a son...? And Warden Laguarde gets declared not guilty...? Edgeworth: I suspect... the kidnappers mistook you for Shaun Fenn. Debeste: A-All of this... was just a mistake? ! Wait... maybe that's why, back then...! Edgeworth: Hm...? Did you just remember something? Debeste: N-No..... It's nothing! I'm useless anyways... Just... leave me alone already! Edgeworth: Th-This is bad! He might be at his emotional limit...! I must get him to tell me what he remembered, and try to calm him down as well. Based on how distressed Sebastian looks right now... ...it must have been quite traumatic. I'll need to help him get back on his feet! Edgeworth: What did you remember just now? Debeste: I-I didn't remember anything... about Po... that guy... Edgeworth: Would \"that guy\" happen to be Blaise? Debeste: D-Darniiiiiit! Oooh... So this is the difference between me and someone who earned his Prosecutor title... Edgeworth: ...I've been waiting to ask you: Why did you become a prosecutor? Debeste: What does it matter!? I'm not fit to be a prosecutor anyways! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: S-Say something! Edgeworth: You must have some reason for choosing this path, right? Debeste: ...N-No, it's not like that! It wasn't anything special! I became a prosecutor for a really insignificant reason! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: It was just... a personal reason. Edgeworth: Heh... Just like you, I, too, became a prosecutor for a personal reason. Debeste: Huh...? I-Is that true...? B-But... you're a really successful prosecutor... I'm sure that Pops... the P.I.C. chairman... would have been more proud of you than me. Edgeworth: I see... so, you wanted your father's approval. Debeste: Ooh.....! I thought that if I became the best prosecutor, he'd be proud of me! That's why I...! I just wanted to help out Pops as much as I could......! Edgeworth: Would you... happen to be protecting your father? Debeste: Wha... I-I don't have any reason to protect someone like him...! Edgeworth: Didn't you want to help out your father... as much as you could? Debeste: Uuuuuunngh... Just once... I only wanted to be useful to Pops just this once! That way... I could help him regain his repetition! Edgeworth: You seem to be mixing up your words again... The word you're looking for is \"reputation\". Debeste: Huh? N-No one's ever told me that before! Edgeworth: Your father, who has strayed from his path, continues to add to his crimes... Even knowing that, do you truly want things to stay the way they are? Debeste: But... in that case, just what am I supposed to do? Edgeworth: You should triumph over your father, who has treated you like a fool. You must stop Blaise before he commits another crime! Debeste: ! I never thought of it that way. I... I want to triumph over Pops! Edgeworth: ...Somehow, it seems he has calmed down once again. Now's my chance to ask him about Blaise's secret! I will give Sebastian the courage to stand up to his father! Edgeworth: Hmm... He seems to have become unsettled again. I suppose I should lend him a hand... Edgeworth: The place you thought would be the safest... Would that have been in Blaise Debeste's hands? Debeste: Ungh... Waaaaaahhh! H-He told me that it would be safer if he took care of the evidence! Edgeworth: I'm sorry... but he has betrayed your trust in the worst way possible. Debeste: Pops... why would he want to hide the evidence...? Edgeworth: Blaise's objective was to have Warden Laguarde found not guilty, by obscuring the truth... Sebastian. You... were used by your father! Debeste: Ungh... Uwaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: It's possible that Blaise Debeste has the evidence with him. Furthermore, we still have no idea where Shaun is. I must return to my investigation posthaste, however... Debeste: This... This is all my fault...! What am I gonna do now...!? Edgeworth: ...Seeing him like this, I can't just leave him be. He is still suffering in the gap between his ideal and reality. He will never move on until he figures out how to live his own life! Sebastian is about to face his greatest trial. Perhaps this is fate. I shall give him the push forward that he needs. Edgeworth: For goodness' sake... Don't you remember your own words? Perhaps his \"own will\" can show him the way. Edgeworth: As a prosecutor... didn't you want to walk a different path from your father? Certainly, the path you have chosen is not an easy one. Nevertheless, you still chose to live as a prosecutor. In that case, it should be clear to you what you need to do...! Debeste: ! Edgeworth: ...I still question how I live my life to this day. But you, Sebastian... have found your own answer. So believe in yourself, Prosecutor Debeste! Debeste: I... WAAAAAAAAAAH! Edgeworth: (He was mistaken for Shaun, and kidnapped by Blaise's underlings. And after his father stole his evidence, he lost his confidence as a prosecutor... The emotions he is going through must be more painful than anything I could imagine.) It's taken longer than I thought... but with that, it's checkmate. Debeste: U-unh, uugh... ungh...! D... D-D-D-D... DARN IIIIIIIIIIIT! Edgeworth: .......... Kay: H-He dashed out of here at full speed... Edgeworth: (It seems if there's one thing he's \"the best\" at, it's running away...) Edgeworth: (Curses! We're running out of time...) We should check in with Mr. Shields. (I'd also like to know what the situation is like on their end.) Kay: But Mr. Debeste ran off again... Edgeworth: We'll just give them the new information we discovered. Franziska will take his place. Kay: Hmm... I wonder if that's going to be enough... Edgeworth: It can't be helped. Since he ran away, there's nothing more we can do. District Court - Courtroom No. 3 Ray: Eerm. I guess I'll just say it again. If there's no murder weapon, you can't prove the defendant is guilty. Franziska: Franziska: Just because we don't have the murder weapon, doesn't mean the defendant is innocent! It seems you wish to taste the sting of my whip. Ray: Gyaaah! Laguarde: Mr. Attorney. This trial... How much longer will it take? Because it feels like it hasn't gone anywhere at all for a good while now! Ray: Well, sorry, but that stubborn prosecutor over there just doesn't seem to understand. Franziska: Until I am satisfied... ...this whip will lash out at you as many times as I see fit. Ray: (By now, she's probably whipped me once for every year I've been alive... Miles... What's taking you so long? Even though we're just stalling for time, Uncle Ray can't keep this up much longer!) Whoops, 'scuse me. Phone call. Mind if I take this? Gravelle: ...I will allow it. Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. Ray: Oh, Miles, it's you. How's it going over there? Edgeworth: We found Sebastian. Ray: Oh! And the knife and chisel? Edgeworth: It seems he handed the evidence over to Blaise Debeste. It's very likely that Blaise knows the whereabouts of the murder weapon. Ray: Ex-chairman Debeste!? But, why would Blaise...? Edgeworth: That, I don't know yet. However, there may be some hidden connection between... ...Fifi Laguarde and Blaise. Ray: Gotcha. In that case, I'll issue a subpoena for Blaise Debeste right away. Edgeworth: ! Ray: I'll grill him personally. Edgeworth: I will continue to search for the missing evidence. (And for Shaun, as well...) Ray: Try to hurry it up, would ya? We're at our wits end over here! It feels like the verdict could be handed down at any moment! Edgeworth: Understood. (How much longer can Judge Gravelle's heart hold out? I know she's in a lot of pain... I've got to hurry.) Outside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza Kay: So? How's the trial going? Edgeworth: Blaise will be taking the stand. I don't know how things will turn out, though. Kay: He'll do anything, from hiding evidence to kidnapping... He really is nothing but trouble. Edgeworth: I agree. We should probably take another look at the evidence concerning him. Kay: OK! Leave it to me! First, here's the latest evidence fresh from the scene! Edgeworth: They're... the gloves from earlier. Although I am certainly curious about them... Anything else? Kay: The case files from the IS-7 Incident. If I recall, Blaise was also involved in this, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. He was involved in destroying the evidence. For now, let's keep this on hand. IS-7 Incident Documents jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Now then... is there anything else? Kay: Of course! Last but not least... We've got this! Edgeworth: This is... the Yatagarasu's badge. ...Kay. I'm talking about things related to Blaise. Please be serious. Kay: But aren't you always going around presenting random evidence too, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Gah...! No... W-Well... That's... Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?) Kay: Ah! What're you doing here? Debeste: WHOOOOOOOAAAHH! Kay: H-He ignored us... Edgeworth: (He came out of the Grand Tower... What was he doing in there?) Kay: Let's go investigate what Mr. Debeste was up to! Edgeworth: Yes... Let us go. Grand Tower - Rooftop Edgeworth: Hm? (The hatch is open...) Kay: It might be Mr. Debeste who opened it! Grand Tower - 51st Floor Storeroom Edgeworth: (Did Sebastian come in here...?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Over there! The safe's open! Edgeworth: (Did he come here to open that? ...Let's examine it thoroughly.) Kay: There's something inside the safe! Edgeworth: Let's go ahead and have a look. There are some documents in here... Kay: Hmm... it's just a bunch of papers and... huh? There's a photo here too. Edgeworth: Hm? This is a picture of...! Kay: Huh!? Th-That's Mr. Knightley! Knightley: ...Horace Knightley. The president's bodyguard. Kay: Why is his picture here? And what are all of these papers for!? Edgeworth: I don't know... We will have to read the documents to find out. I'm all but certain there is a connection between Knightley and Kanis. Kanis's chess partner, whose identity remained unknown until now... ...was actually Knightley all along. That is proof enough. Tomorrow, I shall interrogate him in the warden's office. I'll get him to confess that he's one of Kanis's henchmen. That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago... ...you simply must retrieve it. Edgeworth: This... seems to be a report about Knightley. Kay: Not to mention, it was apparently written before Knightley was killed...! Edgeworth: (Horace Knightley was murdered while he was being interrogated in the warden's office...) Judging from the contents, this document was probably written by Fifi Laguarde. Kay: I knew it! Edgeworth: The question, however, is who this report was addressed to. Kay: Ah! The owner of this safe is...! Edgeworth: The Conductor... Blaise Debeste. Kay: So, this proves that Ms. Laguarde and Blaise are connected! Edgeworth: Indeed. However, it's not just the two of them. Kay: Huh? Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste and Fifi Laguarde were searching for Kanis's henchmen. Kay: Bodhidharma Kanis! That dog-loving assassin! Edgeworth: This means that there is a hidden connection between the three of them. Kay: I wonder what it could be? Edgeworth: I don't know, but it must be related to this case. Report on Knightley jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Ah! There's some other stuff in here that I remember seeing! Edgeworth: Hm? There's something on his finger. Kay: Let's have a closer look! Oh! It looks like an expensive ring! Edgeworth: Don't steal it. Kay: Wha...! I didn't do anything yet! Edgeworth: It's Horace Knightley's... The chessboard and the ring... All of his possessions are inside this safe. Kay: So basically, all of this stuff is evidence from the prison case? Edgeworth: Correct. Kay: Then, the knife and chisel that vanished might be in here too! Let's see. Mr. Knife... Mr. Chisel... Hmm. They're not in there... I guess this is all just Mr. Knightley's stuff. Edgeworth: I see... That's too bad. (Horace Knightley... is dead.) Knightley: EEEEEDGEWOOOOOORTH!!! This game isn't over yet! You hear me! I...! I...! Edgeworth: (However, the game is not over yet... ...unless I can see it through to its end!) Knightley's Mementos data jotted down in my Organizer. Grand Tower - Rooftop ???: Young lady, good sir. ...Might I interest you in some cotton candy? Edgeworth: Hm? ???: There is also ice cream, if that is what you'd prefer? Edgeworth: Y-You! Sh-Shelly de Killer! de Killer: It's good to see you are well, Mr. Edgeworth. Kay: Wh-What are you doing in a place like this!? de Killer: As you can see, I am selling cotton candy. Would you care for some \"Heavenly Cotton Candy\"? Even sweeter than death. One bite will send you straight to heaven. Edgeworth: (That's definitely not something I'd want to buy from De Killer.) de Killer: The meaning of my message... Have you understood it? de Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Edgeworth: Have you been spying on us this whole time? de Killer: Spying? Heavens no. I was simply watching over you... ...while disguised as a cotton candy salesman. Edgeworth: (Isn't that the exact same thing!? What is this man's objective?) Were you the one... who murdered the president? de Killer: No. The contact with my client has already expired. ...President Huang is a bit of a celebrity in the world of assassins, you see. Over the years, many attempts on his life were made, and yet, he stubbornly lives on. He is a robust man, surrounded by flawless security. He even employs body doubles. Edgeworth: (Robust... That president? Rotund seems more apt.) ...However, it seems this time the president's security wasn't exactly flawless. Kay: Mr. Rooke had only just prevented your previous assassination, but this time...! de Killer: I did not kill him. It is not my principle to kill needlessly. I am also grateful to Rooke, a worthy adversary who was connected to me by fate. Thanks to that man, I did not kill a target who had no value to be killed. Edgeworth: (\"Thanks\" to Rooke preventing the assassination... What does he mean?) de Killer: My client deliberately gave me a false target. ...It was a betrayal most foul. I am now searching for my client. In all likelihood... ...it is the same person you are looking for. Edgeworth: (Is he saying that his client murdered the president?) Just who is this person you are referring to...? de Killer: I, myself, am not allowed to say. It would be a violation of the rules. I cannot disclose the identity of my clients. For to do so would create a problem of trust with my other clients. This is precisely why I am personally searching for them myself. Kay: What are you going to do when you find your client? de Killer: Of course... they shall be rewarded with a punishment most befitting of a traitor. Kay: Whaaaa!? That person... Wh-What'll happen to them? de Killer: ...I will leave that up to your imagination. Edgeworth: (It certainly won't be anything pleasant...) de Killer: Oh, yes... I will tell you just one more thing. Three days ago, Bodhidharma Kanis escaped from prison. Edgeworth: What!? de Killer: Three nights past, Kanis's solitary cell was found vacant. It was almost as if he knew I would come pay a visit. Edgeworth: (He visited Kanis's cell? Could it be, that the person De Killer is searching for is...) de Killer: Well then, if you'll excuse me, I must get going. Let us both do our best in tracking down that person... Edgeworth: (So, De Killer and Kanis. These two assassins...) Outside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza Edgeworth: (Hmm. This sound is...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Judge Gravelle's cellphone is ringing! Edgeworth: (Could it be Shaun?) ???: Mr. Edgeworth. How are you doing? Edgeworth: (It sounds like they're using a voice changer...) Who is this? ???: Someone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood... Edgeworth: (The red hood?) ...Are you the person who ambushed Kay? ???: Brilliant deduction! I'd expect no less from a prodigy prosecutor such as yourself! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I wanna listen in on this too! Edgeworth: Very well. (I'll put it on speaker...) ???: Well, I must say that I didn't expect the girl to get amnesia. Kay: Hey! What's that supposed to mean!? ???: But that's not all, y'see. Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane. Edgeworth: What!? (This must be the person De Killer spoke of...!) ???: I really should thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: You have no reason to thank me! ???: Oh, you haven't noticed? My, that's troublesome, y'know. I wanted you to catch Blaise for me... ...so I took dear little Kay. Edgeworth: What? ???: If Kay was suspected, I knew you would investigate the case. And I was sure that the great Miles Edgeworth would be able to catch Blaise! It was according to my plan! And y'know, I get the feeling that you have the wrong idea, so let me clear something up. Blaise Debeste wasn't the one who kidnapped Ms. Gravelle's son. Edgeworth: ! You... Why do you know about the kidnapping? ???: You and Ms. Gravelle are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you... Edgeworth: (How could this person know something like that...? Judge Gravelle was supposed to have visited me using the detective's name...) ???: I bet you're wondering how I knew about the kidnapping, right? It's quite simple, really! It's because darling little Shaun is in my care right now. Edgeworth: What!? Kay: Huh!? ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Quickly, little Kay! You have to hurry and steal him back! You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you? Kay: You even know it's my first job!? Edgeworth: (Why does this person know everything in so much detail?) ???: Well... I suppose I can't blame you for your mistake. It seems Blaise was after Shaun as well, y'see. Edgeworth: (So there were two kidnappings...) ???: He's such a fool, y'know. Kidnapping his own son instead! Edgeworth: Is Shaun there with you? If he is, then I would like to hear his voice. ???: Hmm. He's here, but I'm afraid I can't do that. Y'see, he's asleep right now. Edgeworth: In that case, there's no way for us to know if you really kidnapped Shaun or not. ???: ...Hmph. I suppose you don't have to believe me if you don't want to. Edgeworth: What is your objective? Is it to get Fifi Laguarde declared not guilty? ???: A not guilty verdict, eh... I couldn't care less about that. Edgeworth: (So his objective is different from Blaise's?) ???: ...I think I'll keep my objective a secret for now. Well then, I must be going. I hope you enjoy yourself, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Don't think you can get away with this. ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: Ngh...! Kay: Who in the world was that...? Edgeworth: I don't know. We don't have enough information. Kay: Darn it! We're totally clueless! Meanwhile, they seem to know everything about us! Edgeworth: ! (Know everything about us...?) Kay, you're right. Thinking about it, it is strange. How does the culprit know so much about us? Kay: It's so weird! I mean they even know about the kidnapping! Edgeworth: We must figure out how the culprit was able to obtain that information. (I must recall... What exactly did that person know?) ???: You and Ms. Gravelle are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you... ???: You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you? Kay: You even know it's my first job!? ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Edgeworth: (That's it! By analyzing our conversation with the culprit...!) I've figured it out, Kay. I know the source of this person's information! Kay: What!? Really!? Edgeworth: In all likelihood, this person probably... Edgeworth: I believe it is highly likely that we have been bugged. Kay: B-Bugged!? Edgeworth: If you recall what that person said... ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Edgeworth: If they couldn't see our faces, that means they weren't talking our pictures or following us. Kay: Th-Then, they must've planted a bug somewhere! Could it be in my stuff...? Edgeworth: (Was there anything they could have had a chance to bug...? There must be a hint somewhere in our conversation just now... That's right... that person knew something they shouldn't have. The conversation between Judge Gravelle and myself in the visitor's room...) Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! Gravelle: Hush. Please, have a seat. Edgeworth: (The only evidence I had with me at the time was...!) Where was the bug planted...? Edgeworth: Kay. May I see your badge? Kay: My Yatagarasu's badge? No way! Edgeworth: Wh-Why not...? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, just because you became a Great Thief's assistant... ...doesn't mean you're ready to wear this badge yet! Edgeworth: That's not it! It's very likely that a bug was planted in it. Kay: Whaaat!? In my badge? Edgeworth: Let's take a closer look. Kay: Ah! This is...! Edgeworth: It seems I was right. Yatagarasu's Badge data updated in my Organizer. Kay: How did you know? Edgeworth: The person had been in contact with you. Kay: You mean, when I was knocked unconscious. Edgeworth: Yes. That's why I thought one of your possessions might have been bugged. However, that person also overheard my conversation with Judge Gravelle. Even though that conversation took place in the visitor's room with just the two of us... Kay: Ah, so you were holding onto it at that time... Edgeworth: Exactly. All the other evidence had been taken away from me... Only the Yatagarasu's badge remained with me. Kay: So this creep's been listening in on us the whole time! Edgeworth: Indeed. That must be how they knew about all the information we collected. Kay: Does that mean... they're also listening in on this conversation? Edgeworth: Most likely. Kay: Hey, buster! Edgeworth: K-Kay... Kay: Eavesdropping is for cowards! Why don't you come out here and fight us fair and square!? Edgeworth: (Hm? What was that sound just now?) Nicole: Owwwwwwww... Kay: Huh? That's... Nicole! Nicole: Honestly, y'all scared the bejeezus out of me! Your voice was so loud there, Lil' Missy... I was so surprised I done fell flat on my behind! Kay: I-I'm sorry...! Nicole: What were ya gettin' so riled up for? Kay: You gotta hear this! It really grinds my gears! Nicole: Yes, yes? Edgeworth: ...Kay. Please just leave it at that. Unless you want to make tomorrow morning's headlines. Kay: Ah! That was close... Nicole: Aww, shucks. Don't be such a stick in the mud... What's wrong with lettin' a gal open her heart and spill the beans? Edgeworth: (For now, I'll turn the bug off.) Bug data jotted down in my Organizer. Nicole: So... did ya find the kidnappers? Edgeworth: Ms. Swift. Was the boy you saw being kidnapped... ...this boy in the photo? Nicole: Hmm? Nope, they ain't nothin' alike. He had a more stupid-lookin' face, and was wearin' a collared school uniform... Kay: I thought so... Edgeworth: (Yet again, we were led astray by this woman's testimony...) We will have to conduct our investigation all over again. So, we're back where we started. Are there any new leads...? (There's only 20 minutes left until 2 o'clock! Will we be able to make it in time...?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Mr. Edgeworth! About that phone call just now... Wasn't there a strange sound at the end? Edgeworth: A strange sound...? Edgeworth: Don't think you can get away with this. ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: Now that you mention it... It sounded like an explosion (Sound of an explosion - Sound of an explosion was heard during the call from the kidnapper.). It might be a hint to establish the culprit's whereabouts... Nicole: Mm-hmm. I see, I see. The sound of an explosion, eh? Edgeworth: Hmph! I would appreciate it if you stopped eavesdropping on us! Nicole: Mr. Prosecutor... Yer as stingy as ever. Edgeworth: (...First, let's see what she has to say...) (Clearing all \"Talk\" options of Nicole leads to:) Nicole's Tape Recorder data jotted down in my Organizer. ???: Mr. Edgewooooorth! Edgeworth: Mr. Saint, Ms. Berry! Simeon: D-Did you find him? Kay: Not yet. Just where could Shaun be...? Simeon: Shaun? Kay: Ah! No, no! It's nothing! Don't worry about it. Edgeworth: (They don't know anything about the kidnapping.) Regarding Sebastian, we found him not too long ago. Simeon: Really!? That's great! Thank you so much! Now I won't be arrested again. Edgeworth: Based on the explosion sound we heard from the kidnapper's phone... ...we know that Shaun is being confined some place in the vicinity of the Coliseum. Kay: One of the garbage dumps is right next to the Coliseum! Edgeworth: Shaun was almost certainly taken there. In which case... the place he is being confined to must also be somewhere close by. Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Could I ask you to search the area around this garbage dump? Gumshoe: .....You don't have to ask me like we're strangers, sir! It feels... so distant. ...Please just order me around like you normally do. Edgeworth: Are you sure, Detective? Right now I'm not a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Didn't I tell you, sir? Detectives don't just investigate for the sake of prosecutors! Edgeworth: ...You have my thanks, Detective. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth. Look. It's almost time...! Edgeworth: Yes. It would be best if we hurry. They should also be at their limit. Detective Gumshoe, I'm counting on you! Gumshoe: Leave it to me, sir! This may be an unofficial investigation... ...but I'll call in all of my pals from the station to help! Kay: I'll help too! Stealing Shaun back is my job, after all! Edgeworth: I'll be returning to the courtroom. I might be able to draw out some more time. Kay: Oookay! Well then! Even in the depths of... night... Edgeworth: Hmm. The clock just struck 2...! We have to hurry! Gumshoe: Yessir! Kay: Aaah, my introduction! ...When no other bird dares to take fliiight... Blaise: Well, well, well. If it isn't former Prosecutor Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Blaise Debeste...!) Franziska: Witness! Face forward! We're not done talking yet! Blaise: Like I said, y'see. Why exactly would I have needed to help that person out, Your Honor? Blaise: Y'know, it's a crying shame. Having a beautiful woman declared guilty. Honestly, it brings tears to my eyes. But y'see, there's no reason for me to go out of my way to hide evidence just to save her. Franziska: Franziska: However, we still have the testimony of your son, Prosecutor Debeste! He testified that he handed the evidence over to you! Blaise: Hmm. Well, I haven't the slightest clue what he was talking about. I simply can't imagine why Sebastian would have said something like that, y'know. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What if there is evidence that shows your connection with Warden Laguarde? Blaise: Hm? And just what do you think you're doing, \"Former\" Prosecutor Edgeworth? I was under the impression that you were no longer in any position to stand in court? Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! How dare you barge into my prosecutor's bench... Edgeworth: Franziska. I'm sorry. I need you to lend me the bench for a little while. Franziska: Wh-What are you saying...!? Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! I've brought vital evidence related to this case. Your Honor, please allow me to testify! Gravelle: ........ Blaise: Hah hah hah! She'd never allow it! Ray: Ray: Gravelle-pie. Uncle Ray also asks that he be allowed to testify. There are no objections from the prosecution either, right? Franziska: .......... Understood. The prosecution also has no objections. Blaise: Blaise: There's no way you can allow something like this, y'know. Such high-handed methods... ...surely are enough to warrant being held in contempt of court. Wouldn't y'say, Gravelle? Gravelle: ........ Edgeworth: (Ngh! As long as Shaun is still in danger... ...Judge Gravelle cannot rule against the warden. I must convey to her somehow that the search for her son is progressing!) Judge Gravelle. I ask that you have faith in me and my assistant. Franziska: Now that you mention it, where exactly is she...? Edgeworth: She is currently out searching for the most important piece of evidence. Blaise: Blaise: It's a waste of time. There's no such evidence. Are you stalling for time? How disgraceful. Ray: Ray: Most important piece of evidence, huh? ...Gravelle-pie. I don't really know what that evidence is, but I think we should have faith in her. After all, even if she may not look like it, she's still the Great Thief Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: (Somehow... it seems that Mr. Shields understands.) Judge Gravelle! We've already determined the general location of that evidence. It's only a matter of time before she steals the evidence back. Gravelle: ! ......I understand. Then I shall give you special permission to testify. Edgeworth: ...Thank you, Your Honor. Blaise: This is ridiculous! Gravelle: This vital evidence that you have found... Please present it to the court! Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste and Fifi Laguarde are somehow connected. Allow me to present the evidence that proves it! (Which piece of evidence shows the relationship between Fifi Laguarde and Blaise Debeste?) Edgeworth: This document contains a detailed report regarding the interrogation of a certain man. Ray: A certain man? Edgeworth: That man being the late Horace Knightley. And, the one who interrogated him was the defendant in this trial, Fifi Laguarde. Ray: ! So that means, that was the interrogation where... Edgeworth: That's right... Fifi Laguarde murdered Knightley in the aftermath of the interrogation. And that very interrogation has been recorded in this written report! Gravelle: That... definitely sounds like vital evidence! Franziska: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. Just now, you referred to that document as a \"written report\". Now, just who in the world was that report written for? Edgeworth: I thought you might ask that, Franziska. And that's precisely what is most important about this report...! We found this document inside the safe in the storeroom on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower. Franziska: The 51st floor... The storeroom for the black market auction! Edgeworth: Indeed. And the Conductor of the auction was you, Blaise Debeste! Blaise: ............ Edgeworth: You received a report about the victim from Warden Laguarde! In the face of this evidence, can you still say you have no connection to this case? Blaise: ......In regards to that, I refuse to answer. Edgeworth: What? Blaise: It has yet to be proven in court that I was the Conductor of the black market auction. Edgeworth: Oh? Have you already forgotten the events of this morning? I believe I had already proved it back then, did I not? Blaise: I will not deny that I was bested by you. However, that was at the crime scene. Who knows if the results will be the same in court. An acquittal is still possible, y'see. ...Until it's been proven in court that I am the Conductor of the black market auctions... ...you can't prove that document was addressed to me. Edgeworth: Your logic is twisted...! Blaise: That's not very nice, y'know. My logic isn't twisted, is it? Gravelle? Don't you feel the same way? It was quite unlike you to allow Former Prosecutor Edgeworth's statement just now, y'know. ...It saddens me, y'see. That you would fail to uphold the law as a judge should. In fact, I'm so upset by this, I may have no other choice but to use my last resort, y'know. Gravelle: .....I-It is as you say. Something that has not been proven in court does not merit any deliberation. I will have to... overrule... Mr. Edgeworth's claim. Edgeworth: (Ngh... As I thought, until Shaun has been rescued...) Blaise: Y'see? The truth at the scene and the truth in the courtroom are two very different things. Edgeworth: So, you're saying the truth can be distorted in court, as long as it's for your sake? Blaise: What a horrible thing to say. I'm not distorting the truth or anything like that, y'know. If a not guilty verdict is handed down, then that becomes the truth. That's all it is, y'see. Edgeworth: (It's useless. There's nothing we can do useless the missing evidence turns up...) Blaise: Now then, Gravelle. Why don't you deliver a Not Guilty verdict and let's get this over with? After all, that evidence... isn't gonna show up any time soon, y'know. ???: Gravelle: Wh-Who raised an objection just now? Debeste: ...P-Pops... Blaise: .....Sebastian. Debeste: ......Uugh. Blaise: Why did you come back here, now of all times? Gravelle: Sebastian! What is the meaning of this? Franziska: Just where were you and what have been doing since you abandoned your own trial? Debeste: I-I'm sorry. I was... umm... Franziska: Such an act is unbecoming of a prosecutor! You should be ashamed! Debeste: I... umm... well... Blaise: Sebastian. You still don't get it, y'know. This court has no place for sniveling child such as yourself! Debeste: .....Pops.....! I...... I...! I-I've come to present new evidence, Your Honor! So, so... please! Let me take my place back at the prosecutor's bench! Edgeworth: (Sebastian...! I didn't think he would come back...) Blaise: Blaise: Hah hah hah hah! What's all this now, Sebastian? You don't seem at all like your normal self! Debeste: ........Uugh. Pops... Blaise: Hm? Come now! What's the matter? You want Daddy to play with you? Is that it? Well then, why don't we just head on back home. Debeste: R-Return to the witness stand. Blaise: What's wrong? You're shaking like a leaf. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! The prosecutor officially in charge of this case has just arrived with new evidence. The trial is still in session. In light of this, shouldn't we continue with the proceedings? Gravelle: ........ Ray: Naturally, the defense has no objections, Your Honor. I'm sure the defense attorney originally in charge would say the same. Franziska: .....The prosecution has no objections, either, Your Honor. Gravelle: .......... Blaise: Continue with the proceedings? That won't be necessary. Isn't that right? Gravelle. Edgeworth: (Blaise still believes that he was the one who kidnapped Shaun. As long as Shaun still hasn't been found... ...Judge Gravelle will remain bound by Blaise, and nothing else will change that!) Gravelle: .......... Th-That sound is... Edgeworth: (Her cell phone...!) Hm...! (My phone as well...?) Ray: Eh? Uncle Ray's phone is also...! Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! Kay: Mr. Shields! Gumshoe: We've found Shaun, sir! Kay: We rescued Shaun! Edgeworth: Excellent work, Detective! Ray: That kid was the most important piece of evidence, right? Way to go, Kay! Kay: Eheheh! I wanted to spread the word quickly, so I had everyone call! Edgeworth: .....Judge Gravelle. It's for you. Gravelle: ..... Gravelle: .......Yes. I see. I'm..... I'm so glad you're safe...! Make sure you properly thank everyone. OK? ............Be careful, and come home safe. Gravelle: ...Let us resume the proceedings. Now that I may once again swing my gabel to my heart's content. Blaise: Hah...! You're kidding, right? This is just a sad joke, y'know! Gravelle: Witness! This is no joke! Please return to the stand! Prosecutor Debeste, as well. Promptly return to your seat at the prosecutor's bench! Debeste: Y-Yes, Your Honor! Franziska: ........Sebastian Debeste. Debeste: Y-Yes, Ms. von Karma...!? Franziska: .....I leave the rest to you. Debeste: Huh...? Franziska: \"Going up against your own father...\" It won't be easy. I shall observe how things pan out... from the gallery. Gravelle: Now then, allow me to ask once more... Is the prosecution ready? Prosecutor Debeste. What is this new evidence you wish to present...? Debeste: .....The missing knife and chisel, Your Honor. Ray: You mean they've finally been found!? Gravelle: Prosecutor Debeste! Is this true!? Debeste: ...Th-The knife and chisel... I wasn't able to find them... I searched and searched! I really did! But... it was already too late... Edgeworth: (Too late...?) Ray: What do you mean? Debeste: I remembered... This morning, when I passed by Pops in the garage at home... ...he was holding something wrapped in a newspaper. Debeste: Pops, where are you going? Blaise: Ah, Sebastian. Just taking out some trash. Debeste: At that moment, I heard it. .....The faint sound of a bell. Ray: Could that sound have been, by any chance... Edgeworth: ...the bell attached to Kanis's chisel!? Gravelle: In other words... you're saying that the witness threw away the evidence? Blaise: ........ Debeste: I searched for it, but I didn't make it in time. I'm sorry... Ray: Where exactly did you search for it? Debeste: The garbage dump! I went to the garbage dump and searched everywhere! I thought the evidence Pops threw away had to be there...! Edgeworth: Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?) Kay: Ah! What're you doing here? Debeste: WHOOOOOOOAAAHH! Kay: H-He ignored us... Edgeworth: (So at that time, he had gone to the garbage dump...) Debeste: But... but... ...this was all I could find. Gravelle: This is...? It smells rather peculiar... Ray: Now that you mention it, there's kind of a funky smell coming from you as well... Debeste: Wh-What do you expect!? I was digging through garbage! Edgeworth: And what of the knife? Debeste: I think it's buried somewhere in that giant mountain of trash... ...but I couldn't find it by myself. Gravelle: ...I understand. I shall accept this into evidence. Blaise: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Well done, Sebastian! You never betray my expectations, y'know! You searched so desperately through the garbage and that's all you have to show for it? Debeste: Urk...! Blaise: Awww, what a tear-jerker! I'm tearing up already! Ray: Ray: It's a bit too early for tears, don't you think? We haven't examined the evidence properly yet. Blaise: ...I think it's just a pointless waste of time, y'know. Ray: I'm counting on you. Sebastian, Miles. Show him that the truth can be exposed in court and take him down! Edgeworth: (Mr. Shields is backing us up. Now all we need is a breakthrough...!) Prosecutor Debeste. Let's take a closer look at the evidence. Debeste: R... Right! Edgeworth: Let's have a look inside. (It'd be great if we could find some kind of proof.) This is... the bell that was attached to Kanis's chisel... Are there any traces left behind on it? Debeste: .....Ack, it's no good. There's not even a single smudge on it... Gravelle: What did you find, Prosecutor Debeste!? Blaise: Did you even find anything? Debeste: D... Darn it... Blaise: Of course you'd find nothing. Something like that can't be called evidence, y'know. All it is, is trash. It may be sad, but that's the truth, y'see. Edgeworth: (Were Sebastian's efforts all for naught...?) Indeed, this bell does not seem to be valid evidence... (However...) Debeste: Mr. Edgeworth! Are you really giving up!? Blaise: Calm as always, Edgeworth. Quite unlike Sebastian here! Gravelle: ...Well then, is the prosecution finished with its argument? Debeste: Debeste: Verity, not yet! We're not through yet! There's still something we haven't examined! Blaise: You're still not giving up? Struggling in vain's not cute at all, y'know. Edgeworth: (It seems Sebastian hasn't given up yet either. I was just thinking the exact same thing. The last item remaining... Is it trash, or is it evidence...? If we don't examine it, we'll never find out... The item I'm thinking of is...) Debeste: We're still not done examining the newspaper that the bell was wrapped in! Edgeworth: (It seems that Sebastian has the same idea as I do.) Blaise: Wow, this is just wonderful, y'know. So wonderful, it's to cry for. Is it desperation, or simply reckless abandon? Are you really going to... pin all your hopes on a worthless scrap of newspaper? Edgeworth: Heh. We won't know for sure whether or not it's \"worthless\" until we examine it, will we? Sebastian. Let's examine it posthaste. Edgeworth: Is this... a handprint? Debeste: ! There's something greasy on here too... Is it oil? Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! We'd like to request a fingerprint analysis on this paper! Could you please summon someone from forensics? Gravelle: Your request is accepted. Contact the lab at once! Forensics: Reporting! These are definitely fingerprints! However... it's from a glove! Debeste: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? Blaise: Didn't I tell you? It's nothing but a worthless scrap of paper. Just thinking about it, y'know. When handling important evidence... ...what kind of idiot wouldn't use gloves!? Oh wait, wouldn't that be you? The idiot who doesn't know when to give up. Ray: ...That's pretty harsh, talking to your son like that. Blaise: What's wrong with calling an idiot an idiot? If you want to be The Best, you have to be heartless. I have no compassion worthless individuals, not even my own son! Debeste: Pops...! I.....! Blaise: Y'know, you've always called yourself a genius prosecutor, haven't you? Didn't I explain to you this morning why you were a genius up until now? That's right. It was all because of me. Because of my authority. You were always being protected. By people like Gravelle... and me. Debeste: ........Uuunghh. Blaise: Now, get that stinking face of yours out of my sight. Debeste: Stinking... Blaise: Y'know, now that I think about it, that stench might just suit you perfectly. Just keep it away from my nose, or my eyes will start watering. Debeste: Debeste: Wrong... You're wrong, Pops. Blaise: ...Sebastian? What are you talking about? Debeste: ...You're the one who stinks, Pops. It's you, not me! Blaise: What...? Debeste: ...You haven't noticed, have you? You smell, Pops. So much that you can't even hide it. Mr. Edgeworth... Try smelling the hand print on the newspaper. Edgeworth: The smell...? ...Hmm. It smells... like oil... Debeste: I know something that smells just like it... Edgeworth: (Come to think of it, back then...) Edgeworth: (It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.) Debeste: That's right... The smell proves it. It proves that the culprit who hid the evidence was...! It's no good... I guess I can't become the best after all. I'm too soft... I could never be so heartless... ...I just can't bring down my father with my own hands. Edgeworth: (Prosecutor Debeste...) ..........Summon... your courage. \"Become a different prosecutor from your father\"... Wasn't that what you decided? Debeste: ! Edgeworth: We are prosecutors. And as prosecutors, we stand in the courtroom. In that case, isn't it our duty to shed light on the truth? Debeste: ........ Edgeworth: Exposing crimes and bringing criminals to justice. Even if the criminal is your own father... ...that is your duty, as a prosecutor. Didn't I promise you? That if you have the courage to stand up... I will show you the way. And if you cannot do it alone, then we shall do it together... Debeste: ...Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Allow me to present the evidence that connects this hand print with my father! Edgeworth: This is the smell of motor oil. The kind used for maintaining motorcycles... Debeste: Both myself and Mr. Edgeworth have smelled this exact same smell before! Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste! It was in your garage! Blaise: ! Edgeworth: And wouldn't you say these fingerprints have a rather peculiar shape? The five letters that spell out D-E-A-T-H. It's exactly the same as your own gloves. Blaise: Blaise: Ha ha ha! You can buy gloves like that from anywhere! It doesn't prove a thing! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that really the case? Debeste: That's not the only thing that these two pieces of evidence have in common! Edgeworth: (The fingerprints on the newspaper that was used to wrap up the bell... ...and Blaise's mechanic's gloves...) This is the unmistakable similarity they both share! Edgeworth: If you examine the imprint left by the letter A, you'll see it's unmistakably from this glove. Blaise: Whaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: And that's not all... There is one more item we must take note of. Namely, these dirt stains. I suggest we do a comparative analysis of the dirt stains from the newspaper and the glove. If the contents match up... then it will prove to be decisive evidence. Gravelle: Bailiff! Please have these dirt samples sent to forensics for analysis immediately! Blaise: Gaaaaaaaarrgh! Edgewooorth! Sebastiaaaan! You lowly prosecutors! Do you have any idea who I am!? Debeste: Pops... you can't run away anymore. It's been proven in court that you concealed the evidence. And that you tried to cover for the defendant... Blaise: Y-You're saying that I'm... Guilty? That I'll be sent to prison...? Me, Blaise Debeste? A couple of snot-nosed punks are gonna make me disappear!? There must be some mistake! Debeste: Debeste: Be a man and admit your crimes! Blaise: Blaise: Do you really think you can survive if I'm not around? Debeste: I..... I'll be fine now. I thought I wanted to be the best prosecutor, so I could get your approval, Pops. But, when I was kidnapped by your men... and stuck in that dark room, I started thinking. \"I am... truly powerless.\" I despaired, and averted my eyes from the truth. But... ...at that moment, Mr. Edgeworth stepped in and showed me the way. And now, I am no longer just a child chasing after his father's approval! I've become capable... I can find evidence on my own now! Blaise: Wha... My men kidnapped you? Why were you...!? Debeste: Debeste: Pops, I'll show you the truth you never knew... through this trial. Blaise: Sebastiaaan! How dare you speak to me like that...! You should've just stayed as an idiot son! Debeste: You may have hated me to the very end, Pops... ...but I... I've always looked up to you. Thank you for everything up until now. .....And goodbye. Blaise: You... Since when did you... All you've ever been able to do was depend on me! SebaSTIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNN! Gravelle: It has been established that the evidence was concealed by Blaise Debeste himself. A judgment regarding his concealment of evidence shall be delivered at a separate trial. The missing chisel and knife still have yet to be found. However, once a search of the waste disposal site is underway, they will surely be discovered. Laguarde: ...The knife will be found? Wh-What will happen to me if it's found? Edgeworth: Heh. No need to worry. You'll simply receive the punishment you deserve for your crime. Laguarde: Grrrr! Punishment? For me!? Blaise, what in the world are you doing!? You! You... After all your boasting about being able to create your own truths and Not Guilty verdicts! That's why I contacted you immediately after the prison incident in the first place! And to make matters worse, you even kidnapped the wrong kid! I just can't believe this! You really, really, really are... completely useleeeeeessss! Edgeworth: ...That was certainly a violent outburst. But you heard her, Prosecutor Debeste. Debeste: Yeah. She got flustered and said a bunch of important stuff! ...Right? Edgeworth: Indeed... That's correct. (He still doesn't seem very sure of himself...) Gravelle: Very well. And with that, this court is adjourned. ???: Edgeworth: What? Franziska: Huh!? Gravelle: Wh-Who are you? Lang: Judge Gravelle. It's still too early for a happy ending. Lang Zi says: \"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case.\" Gravelle: And who... might you be? Lang: The name's Shi-Long Lang. I'm just a humble, lone investigator. Gravelle: Do you have some objection with this trial? Lang: Hah! Not a chance! The defendant there has a heart as black as a moonless night. Laguarde: Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...? Lang: You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree? Edgeworth: Agent Lang. What are you talking about? Lang: The SS-5 Incident from 12 years ago... It's a case I'll never forget. Edgeworth: (12 years ago...?) Lang: ......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa. Edgeworth: (12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?) Edgeworth: (Might it have something to do with Lang's father and President Huang?) Lang: Fifi Laguarde. And you, Blaise Debeste. Back then, the two of you killed off the Lang clan... Laguarde: Rrgh... Gravelle: Were you involved in the incident 12 years ago? Lang: That's right, I was. However... I'm not here to chase after ghosts of the past. I'm here for you, Verity Gravelle...! Gravelle: M... Me? Lang: You, and one other... Shaun: .......... Gravelle: Shaun! Lang: Ms. Gravelle! You're coming along too! As a suspect in the murder of the president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang! What evidence do you...!? Lang: Lang: Settle down, Mr. Prosecutor. The investigation has only just begun. We're going to inspect the crime scene with the suspects in attendance. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang... did he get his hands on some new pieces of evidence?) Lang: If you have any objections, then you can tag along as well. Edgeworth: ...I shall do just that. Shaun: ........ Edgeworth: (\"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case\"... There are still many mysteries yet unsolved surrounding the murder of the president... Namely, the true nature of the \"giant monster\", and...) ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: (The true identity of the person on the other end of the phone...) To be continued. \n-- Shaun's Rehearsal -- Shaun: I wasn't feeling too great during yesterday's shoot, so I made a few bloopers. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. You said you didn't feel well. Could you tell me more concretely what was wrong? Shaun: That doesn't matter! I just wasn't feeling well, alright!? Kay: You weren't feeling well... Maybe you drank too much milk? Shaun: Wha... How'd you...!? Ah, no, I mean, that's not it... Edgeworth: (So he didn't feel well because of his stomach...) Kay: When I was young, I was told that chewing milk makes it easier on your stomach, y'know? Shaun: Th-This conversation is over! Anyways, I made a few bloopers. Shaun: They're reshooting the scene today, so... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So they planned to reshoot the scene today. And you were practicing for that last night. Shaun: ...My mistakes caused a lot of trouble for the people around me. I'm a pro, so practicing that much more is natural. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He certainly does have an admirable sense of responsibility.) Penny: Shaun is incredibly dedicated to his craft. He didn't even make any major mistakes in those bloopers. But he said if it would make the movie just a tiny bit better... Shaun: Shut up! You don't need to go around blabbering about stupid stuff like that! Penny: Ah... I-I'm sorry. Edgeworth: (If only he was a little more cooperative, I'd have no complaints.) Shaun: Hmph... Anyway, that's what happened. Shaun: Well, I decided to rehearse a little on my own. That's all. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. About your testimony just now... Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Don't I always tell you!? If you're going to practice by yourself, you have to let me know beforehand! Shaun: I-I-I know! Edgeworth: (...My time to speak was completely stolen away from me.) I shall ask you once more. Shaun, about your testimony just now... Kay: But you know, Shaun, I think that's really great! Edgeworth: (Mmph... A-Again!?) Kay: I bet putting in an honest effort like that will make someone even more talented. You'll go from a little thief to a Middle Thief, and then someday you'll become a Great Thief! I'll be doing my best, so you do your best too! OK, Shaun? Edgeworth: ........Ahem. Now then, if I may? Shaun. Do you often rehearse in that way? (At last... At long last, I finally got to ask my question...!) Shaun: I do it all the time. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There are no mistakes in that testimony, correct? Shaun: O-Of course there's no mistakes! It was just a normal, peaceful night! Nothing out of the ordinary happened at all! Kay: A... A peaceful night!? How can you say that when an incident like this has occurred!? Edgeworth: Kay, he is still a child. Please don't get seriously angry. Present Moozilla's Head Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that? Shaun: ...! I don't know anything about it. Edgeworth: Is that true? Shaun: I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something? Edgeworth: (...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after Shaun had already gone back...) Shaun: If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We're not done talking yet! Shaun: What now? Edgeworth: The falling monster's head wasn't the only unusual thing that happened last night. And this is something you should be well aware of. What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling? Present Monster's Footprints or Shaun's Practice Video Edgeworth: Leads to: \"We have evidence right here.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. Take a look at this. Shaun: And what's that supposed to be? Edgeworth: Don't you understand? This shows what happened last night. Shaun: ...... Edgeworth: Hmph... Have I left you speechless? Shaun: ...You're so far off the mark that I have nothing to say. Edgeworth: Argh! (Was I really that far off...?) Kay: Let's review what happened here last night one more time! Edgeworth: Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer! Kay: Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night? Leads back to: \"What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling?\" Edgeworth: We have evidence right here. Shaun: Ah! Could that be...!? Edgeworth: That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance. Shaun: ........Ugh. Lang: What!? You're telling me you have video from last night!? Edgeworth: Exactly. And in this video... ...there is clearly something that is out of the ordinary. Lang: Th-This is... a monster's footprint...! Edgeworth: Would you say that monster's footprints are commonplace on a film set? Gravelle: Shaun... Why did you conceal this video from us? Shaun: ........No reason, really. Lang: Lang: Hey, pup! This is no joking matter! You had a reason to hide it, right? Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Answer him clearly! Shaun: But Mom..... Edgeworth: Well? Shaun: ...I didn't want anyone to see me rehearsing. Lang: ........ Kay: ........ Edgeworth: ........ In other words, you're embarrassed about others seeing you practice. Shaun: ...Yeah. Got a problem with that!? Lang: Lang: You're saying that's why you hid the evidence? Gravelle: Shaun! Shaun: Eep! ...Quit nagging me. You've already busted me, what more do you want? Yeah, the footprints were there, but I just practiced and headed home. Lotta: How come yer so calm after findin' those footprints!? It's a monster, ya know!? A real live monster! Shaun: ...I thought it was just a part of the set. Besides, there's lots of other weird stuff around here too. Nicole: He's suspicious, Chief! This kid's really suspicious! Lotta: Yer right! The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven! Shaun: ...Shut up. We're done talking! Lang: Leads to: \"Wait up...\" Present Monster's Footprints or Shaun's Practice Video Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? We have evidence right here. Shaun: Ah! Could that be...!? Edgeworth: That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance. Shaun: ........Ugh. Lang: What!?

The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven! Shaun: ...Shut up. We're done talking! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We're not done here yet! Shaun: What now? Edgeworth: The monster's footprints weren't the only unusual things that happened last night. Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night? Present Moozilla's Head Edgeworth: Leads to: \"A monster's head fell from the roof of that building.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This shows what happened here yesterday. Shaun: ...And just what exactly does it show? Edgeworth: You don't understand, do you? You are still a child, after all. Shaun: I don't need some guy who's less intelligent than a child telling me that. Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (It seems that wasn't it...) Kay: Let's review what happened here last night one more time! Edgeworth: Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer! Kay: Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night? Leads back to: \"Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night?\" Edgeworth: A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that? Shaun: ...! I don't know anything about it. Edgeworth: Is that true? Shaun: I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something? Edgeworth: (...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after Shaun had already gone back...) Shaun: If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking! Edgeworth: (It seems that Shaun doesn't really want to talk about last night. Could he be hiding something after all...?) Leads to: \"Wait up...\" Edgeworth: So there was nothing out of the ordinary...? Kay: He doesn't know anything at all about the incident. That's the impression I'm getting. But isn't there evidence that shows something did happen last night? Edgeworth: Yes... I don't have time to waste dealing with a child's lies. Let's present the contradiction. Lang: Wait up... Edgeworth: ? Agent Lang? Lang: Heh heh heh. It's as I thought. Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. This video backs up my logic. Kay: Huh!? Is there something in the video that's related to the case? Lang: Yeah... Take a good, hard look at the monster costume in the top-left. Kay: The Moozilla costume...? Lang: Try comparing it with the one over there right now. Kay: Hmm? It looks like it's just hanging there limply though. And the zipper on its back is zipped up tightly. Edgeworth: (Zipper on its back...?) Wha! (Th-This discrepancy is...!) Lang: Yeah. The difference is plain to see. In the video, the zipper is clearly open! That's right... Someone was inside. Kay: WHAAAAAAAT! Edgeworth: Mr. Powers! Is the costume's zipper usually...? Powers: It's always zipped up tightly when it's not in use... Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. Do you remember? My logic from before... Lang: Two nights ago, Gravelle pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body. Edgeworth: In here? Lang: Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Edgeworth: You're saying the body... was hidden inside the costume? Lang: Yeah, that's right! Judge Gravelle! Two nights ago, you pushed the president off the roof of the tower. You then hid the body inside the monster costume! Gravelle: I... I did no such thing! Lang: Lang: Say what you want, but you're the only one who could've done it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That should have already been proven impossible. The film lot was locked at the time! Judge Gravelle could not have entered this place! Lang: Lang: ...And what if there was an accomplice? Edgeworth: What? Lang: I'll tell you my reasoning, so listen up. -- Mother and Son Theory -- Lang: When the president was pushed off the roof, Shaun was waiting at the film lot. If Shaun was an accomplice, the problem with the locks would be resolved. The two of them then hid the president's body. Inside that monster costume over there... Edgeworth: You think this crime had such an elaborate plan? Lang: To take the life of a nation's president. An elaborate plan is to be expected, don't you think? Gravelle: Gravelle: Shaun would never... take part in such a crime! Lang: Lang: You're the one being suspected. Your words don't carry much weight! Edgeworth: I wouldn't think those two had sufficient motive for something like this, though? Lang: Well, maybe they had a motive that we didn't know about? You were the last one to meet with the president. And you're still keeping the details secret. Don't you think it's only natural that you're being suspected? Gravelle: ...... Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Is there no way for you to tell us your secret. Gravelle: M-My apologies. I just cannot, no matter what... However, when the time I can talk about it comes, I will surely let you know. So, if you could please... Lang: Believe you? Is that what you wanted to say? That's what all criminals say. And you, pup... If you've got an explanation, hurry up and spit it out. Shaun: Hmph. I didn't do nothing. ...That's all I'm saying. Lang: Both mother and son won't talk. You still gonna defend 'em like this? Edgeworth: It's true, Judge Gravelle's actions are a mystery... ...however, we still don't know whether or not that ties in with a motive for murder. Lang: Yeah, that's right. Their motive for murder can wait. For now, let's talk about the situation surrounding the crime. ...And the fact that these two are the only ones who could've done it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang. Don't tell me you're saying Shaun was an accomplice? Kay: Shaun still looks like a grade school kid, he's even got a kiddy backpack to boot! How could he be an accomplice...? There's just no way! Penny: Like I said, Shaun's already in middle school, and the backpack is a part of his costume... Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says! \"No matter how young the cub, never pity an ungrateful pup.\" He may be a little brat, but a villain deserves no mercy. Kay: Uuuh... So Mr. Lang Zi didn't make any allowances for age... Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. You're not just defending him 'cause he's a pup, are you? Edgeworth: Hmph. Of course, that was never my intention. I shall present suitable evidence in due course. Lang: Oh? I'm looking forward to it. My logic's just getting started. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How would that... resolve the problem!? Lang: I figured you'd ask that, Mr. Prosecutor. But y'know, it's actually quite simple. Listen up... First, that woman pushes the president off the roof. Kay: Hmm... she pushes him off. Lang: Then, that brat, who knew the combination for the lock, unlocks the film lot. Kay: I see... the combination unlocks the brat! Edgeworth: Kay, it's the opposite. Lang: ...That's all it takes. With this, the problem of the lock is solved. Your theory that she couldn't get in because she didn't know the combination no longer files! Edgeworth: (Hmm... Regarding the lock, that certainly is a plausible explanation...) Agent Lang. Thank you for your clear explanation. Please, continue with what you were saying before. Lang: Hmph. If you're gonna give up, you better do it now. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Supposing those two were accomplices... Why would they have needed to leave the body hanging there for an entire day!? Lang: Lang: Why don't you give it a rest, and take a good hard look at reality. Thanks to their trickery, our investigation has been confused up until now. Doesn't that about answer your question!? ...Got it? Those two hid the body. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In the video, we cannot see the inside of the costume. So can you really say for certain that the body was placed inside? Lang: ...Yeah, I'll give you that much. In that case, why don't we try examining it? The inside of that costume! There might be some traces left inside. Edgeworth: Mr. Powers, may we examine the inside of the costume? Powers: Sure. Go ahead. But it might be kinda stinky, since I sweat a lot in here... Edgeworth: This is... incredibly dirty. Powers: That's strange... We always make sure to clean it after using it, so that the sweat doesn't damage the costume. Lang: Lang: Isn't this just proof that someone besides you used this costume? I'd say that dirt from the body probably got into the costume. Kay: The president's body did fall on top of the monster's footprint. That must be where the dirt came from! Lang: ...Are you satisfied now? Add statement: \"There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, dirt got into the costume when the body was hidden inside. Wouldn't that mean... ...that the dirt was transferred from the body? Lang: Hah! Isn't that obvious? How else would you say it got there? Kay: ...There's dirt stuck everywhere inside the costume. It looks particularly bad around the chest area. Edgeworth: (Dirt around the chest...? We cannot overlook this fact.) Kay: Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense... Edgeworth: Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point. Kay: In that case, what should we do? Edgeworth: Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail. Let's draw out more information.-- Mother and Son Theory -- Lang: When the president was pushed off the roof, Shaun was waiting at the film lot. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang.

It looks particularly bad around the chest area. Edgeworth: (Dirt around the chest...? We cannot overlook this fact.) Present Crime Scene Notes Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it...\" Kay: Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense... Edgeworth: Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point. Kay: In that case, what should we do? Edgeworth: Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail. Let's draw out more information. Edgeworth: Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it... Is that really the case? Lang: You have a problem with that? Edgeworth: There is a fair amount of dirt inside the front of the costume. Kay: Yeah, that IS a lot of dirt... Edgeworth: However, I would like you to focus on the state the body is in. It's lying on top of the dirt, and yet there's no dirt on the front of the body. If the body really was inside the costume... ...then it's strange that the front of the body isn't stained with more dirt! Lang: Rrgh! Well then, how would you explain it? How did the dirt get inside the costume!? Edgeworth: (From the video footage, it's very likely that someone was inside the costume. But just who could it have been...?) Kay: Hmm... Where have I seen this? Edgeworth: What's the matter, Kay? Kay: I just feel like I remember seeing something that looked like this dirt somewhere before... ...but where was it? There were these bits of gray fragments mixed in with the dirt. Edgeworth: (Gray... fragments? There does seem to be something other than normal dirt mixed into it...) Kay: Something must've gotten stuck to it, and lots of it I might add. Hmm... Edgeworth: (Something got stuck to it? This may merit a closer look. Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?) Present Mechanic's Gloves Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is what you're thinking of, isn't it, Kay? Kay: Oh! Mr. Edgeworth, you sure are sharp! Edgeworth: Hmph... Naturally. Kay: ...But too bad! Not this time! Edgeworth: Argh! (You should have just said that in the first place!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, can't you remember? Dirt, dirt... Where else did we see this dirt? Edgeworth: (Dirt... Wasn't there a piece of evidence that had dirt on it?) Kay: It's on the tip of my brain, but I just can't quite place it. Where on earth have we seen dirt like this before? Leads back to: \"(Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?)\" Edgeworth: This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it. Lang: Huh? And what of it? Edgeworth: We found an item belonging to a certain man, that was covered in the same type of dirt. That is to say, these gloves. Lang: Those dirt stains... certainly look the same. But, tell me... Just what exactly is this grey substance!? Edgeworth: This grey substance is... Plastic Edgeworth: Yes, I believe it's plastic. Your thoughts? Lang: Lang: Hah! You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Prosecutor! Put more \"BANG!\" into your claims, like you usually do! Edgeworth: Ah... Hmm. Lang: As for my opinion on the matter... I'll tell you right now, that stuff is definitely not plastic! Edgeworth: Nngwaaah! (So that wasn't it...) Kay: Let's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it? Edgeworth: Right. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally. Leads back to: \"This grey substance is...\" Concrete Leads to: \"This grey substance must be fragments of concrete.\" Paint Edgeworth: No matter how you look at it, this must be paint! Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor! When did you become so scatterbrained!? No matter how you look at it, this doesn't look like paint! Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (I suppose not...) Kay: Let's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it? Edgeworth: Right. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally. Leads back to: \"This grey substance is...\" Edgeworth: This grey substance must be fragments of concrete. Kay: You mean... the stuff that was scattered around the monster's footprints? Edgeworth: Exactly. Meanwhile, who do these gloves, which are stained with the same kind of dirt, belong to? Kay: Oh, I remember! We found it at Blaise's place! Edgeworth: Earlier today, we went to Blaise's garage. There, we discovered these dirt-stained gloves. Come to think of it, there were also hammers, shovels, and other tools placed inside, as well. Why would mechanic's gloves, intended to be used on machines, be covered in dirt? If he broke the concrete with the hammer, and then dug into the soil with the shovel... ...then it's only natural for dirt like that to get on the gloves. Kay: Then, maybe...! Edgeworth: Yes. The true nature of the monster's footprints... has been made clear. It's possible that these footprints were dug up by Blaise Debeste himself. Lang: Lang: It's possible...? Hmph! It's possible, you say!? Please do enlighten me. 'Cuz I honestly have no clue! Why on earth would he do something like that? Edgeworth: (Why did he make the monster footprints? Thinking about it, the answer must be...) He was digging something up Edgeworth: It's possible he was digging something up. Leads to: \"It probably went something like this.\" He buried something Edgeworth: Could it have been because he buried something? Kay: He buried something!? I smell treasure! So, what did he bury? Edgeworth: If we want to find that out, we'll have to dig it up ourselves. Lang: Lang: You think the police wouldn't have already investigated that? There was absolutely nothing buried beneath those footprints! Edgeworth: Nngwaaah! (It seems that was wrong...) In that case, we should assume the opposite: he dug something up. Leads to: \"It probably went something like this.\" Edgeworth: It probably went something like this. Last night at this spot, there was something that Blaise needed to dig up. For that reason, he broke the lock on the back door ans sneaked into the film lot... Using the hammer and shovel, he set to work. He placed the items he dug up into his bag, but before he could fill in the holes... Kay: Ah! That's when Shaun came to practice! Edgeworth: Exactly. Blaise panicked, and had no choice but to hide himself in the Moozilla costume nearby. Lang: Grr... To think you would deduce so much from just a pair of dirt-stained gloves... However! All of this is merely a possibility! There's still no proof that he was the one who was hiding inside that costume! For all we know, he might've left the scene once he finished digging! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: On the contrary. Such proof does exist, and can be seen... in the video. When this video was recorded, Blaise was definitely inside the film lot. Lang: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (Though I can't blame Agent Lang for not noticing... ...the difference between the current flim lot... ...and the one in Shaun's video. Along with the state of Blaise's garage... ...it's all too clear that Blaise was still here!) What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded? Present duffel bag beside monster costume Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This bag placed near the costume...\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This proves that Blaise was still at the film lot! Kay: Umm... How exactly does it prove that? Lang: Yeah, I'd like a better explanation as well! Edgeworth: ...Argh! (So this has nothing to do with Blaise...) Kay: If something belonging to Blaise could be seen in this video, then proving it would be easy... Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything that comes to mind? Edgeworth: (Something belonging to Blaise... Does anything like that appear in the video?) Lang: Well, Mr. Prosecutor!? How about it...? Is there really any evidence that Blaise Debeste was there? Edgeworth: There's no need to rush, Agent Lang. Leads back to: \"What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded?\" Edgeworth: This bag placed near the costume... There was an identical one inside Blaise's garage. Lang: ! Edgeworth: First, the dirt on the gloves, and now the bag... It seems there is a connection. Mechanic's Gloves data updated in my Organizer. Edgeworth: And that's my proof. Blaise was inside the costume. Ergo, the president's body could not have been hidden inside it! Lang: Aiyaaaaaaaaa! Edgeworth: (It seems I was able to refute Agent Lang's reasoning.) Gumshoe: Someone needs to go investigate Blaise's house right away, pal! We need to know what was inside that bag! Officer: Yessir! Lotta: Y'all pipe down and listen up! Y'all just been sayin' whatever works best for y'all! Edgeworth: (...And the noisy one returns.) Lotta: That there's the footprints of the Mighty Moozilla! They ain't just some random holes dug up by that old coot! Edgeworth: Hmph. I believe the true nature of these footprints has already been proven quite logically. Lotta: Logic schmogic, I ain't buyin' it! Say whatcha want, but I know what I saw, and I saw Moozilla! Edgeworth: (Is she referring to how she saw Moozilla out of the window of the Grand Tower...? Preposterous.) Nicole: Upon our journalist's souls, we ain't havin' none of it! Edgeworth: (That statement is an insult to journalists everywhere...) Nicole: Ah! That's right! There's more to them monsters than just those footprints! I remember hearin' that sonny over there was seen with the monster earlier! I reckon that gal over there said she witnessed it herself! Edgeworth: (When these two are together, all meaningful talk grinds to a halt...) Kay: If we only knew just what the \"monster\" really was, I think those two would quiet down. Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything you can do? Edgeworth: (The monster's true identity...?) We don't have much choice... Let's see what we can do. Lotta: Isn't there somethin' y'all ain't tellin' us about the monster!? Nicole! Ask 'em! Ask 'em right now! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ....Please settle down. Regarding the true identity of that \"monster\", I already know what it is. Lotta: Wha'd ya say!? Edgeworth: That's right. The video Shaun recorded provided the hint that I needed... Lotta: Whatchu talkin' bout? Edgeworth: (Ms. Nichols saw Gourdy... ...when she went to check up on Shaun's practice. At that times, she mistook \"something\" for Gourdy.) The \"monster\" can be seen in this photograph. Lotta: What!? Ain't that just some plain old souvenir photo!? Y'all don't really think ya can pull the wool over the eyes of a pro like me, do ya? Edgeworth: (What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?) Present camera crane Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was...\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The \"Gourdy\" that Ms. Nichols saw... was actually this! Lotta: There ain't no foolin' a real pro! Yer sayin' this is Gourdy!? It don't look nothin' like it! Edgeworth: Argh! (I had my suspicions...) Kay: Let's double-check what Gourdy looks like. Something with a similar shape might be in the photo! Edgeworth: Indeed. (Gourdy's shape...?) Leads back to: \"(What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?)\" Edgeworth: Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was... ...this camera crane! Lotta: Wh-What!? Edgeworth: The video Shaun recorded was shot from fairly high up. A shot from this position would be impossible without a camera crane. Nicole: But...! There ain't no way Ms. Nichols would mistake a camera crane for Gourdy! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I wonder about that. ...Ms. Nichols. Penny: Y-Yes! Edgeworth: Earlier, you said the prescription for your glasses didn't match your eyesight anymore, correct? Penny: Yes. Lately, it seems like my eyesight has suddenly gotten a lot worse. Edgeworth: So would you say that you weren't able to see Gourdy very clearly in the dark? Penny: That's right... Its silhouette was all I could make out... Nicole: But, remember what Ms. Nichols said!? And I quote, \"Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile...\"! Lotta: Camera cranes ain't got no flesh on 'em, let alone skin! It's just a bare steel frame! Edgeworth: That is certainly true. At least, in the case of this photo... However, last night it did have skin. Lotta: Y'all just doin' whatever ya can to get in the way of our big scoop, ain't ya!? Edgeworth: (That was not my intention... ...but since I've come this far, it's time to put an end to your nonsense.) Gourdy's skin is right before our very eyes. This is the \"skin\" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw! Present vinyl sheets Edgeworth: Leads to: \"As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night.\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is the true identity of Gourdy's skin! Lotta: And just how could somethin' like that be taken for skin, ya heinous prosecutor!? Yer just spoutin' nonsense, tryin' to take our whole scoop for yerself! Yer pure evil! Yer a demon prosecutor! Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (That is decidedly not what I'm trying to do.) On its own, the crane bears no resemblance to Gourdy at all. Kay: Something must have been draped over the crane. Edgeworth: (Last night, it looked like it was going to rain... And if that's the case, there's only one thing it could have been!) Leads back to: \"This is the \"skin\" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw!\" Edgeworth: As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night. While it never actually rained... ...Shaun still covered the camera crane with a rainproof sheet. Which, to Ms. Nichols... looked like a monster's skin! Nicole: Whaaaaaaaat! Lotta: Y-Ya gotta be kiddin' meeee! Edgeworth: Isn't that right, Shaun? Shaun: Man, you saw through it all. .....Not bad, old man. Edgeworth: Unfortunately, the \"Gourdy\" that Ms. Nichols saw was nothing more than an illusion. Lotta: Not again... Looks like my dream has shriveled up and died once again... Nicole: M-Mentor! Kay: Seems like things have finally settled down. Lotta: I really thought the boy was hidin' somethin' from me... Guess I had it all wrong. Lang: ...Now that we've figured out the true form of the monster, everyone seems refreshed. Kay: Actually, there's two people here who are totally bummed out. Forensics: Agent Lang! The report is in, sir! We've got the results of President Huang's autopsy! Lang: Good! Show it to me! Lang: \"Contusions and bone fractures found across the body, resulting from tremendous pressure.\" So, this was the cause of death. In other words... he was crushed to death. Edgeworth: (I thought as much...) Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer. Lang: The yellow stain on his chest is currently under investigation... ...but it seems that gunpowder residue was found on his right hand. Kay: Sunflower residue!? I didn't know the president was into gardening! Edgeworth: No, gunpowder residue. Traces of it are left behind when a gun is fired. Since it has been found on his right hand, it's possible that the president fired a gun. Kay: A gun, huh? But we didn't find any guns when we investigated this area. Edgeworth: (...Unexplained gunpowder residue? I'll have to look over the autopsy report later.) Now then, Agent Lang. It seems we have our answer. The president did not die from falling off the roof of the Grand Tower. Rather, he died from being crushed under Moozilla's head! Lang: I can't deny it... Looks like your logic was right after all. Kay: This means the suspicions surrounding Ms. Gravelle should be cleared up, right!? Edgeworth: Yes... Not only the cause of death, but the time of death proves her innocence as well. Judge Gravelle met with the president two nights ago. However, according to the autopsy report, the time of death was around 11 PM last night. Moozilla's head also fell last night... It matches up perfectly. Kay: That's a relief! Lang: Lang: ...Isn't it a bit too early to be relieved? Edgeworth: (Agent Lang?) Lang: The president died after being crushed by the Moozilla's head. That, I will admit. But the problem is, who was responsible for the falling head...? Edgeworth: Moozilla's head fell last night. And last night, the one who was at the film lot was... Gravelle: Gravelle: What are you saying!? Surely, you're not implying... Lang: That's right. You killed him, didn't you? Shaun Fenn! Shaun: ........ Lang: That pup is hiding something. He was at the scene where the body was discovered last night. He also saw the \"footprints\". And despite that, he still claims to know absolutely nothing about the incident? Isn't that a bit too convenient? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: These footprint-shaped holes have not been proven to be related to the case! Just because he saw the holes, doesn't necessarily mean that he's involved in the incident! Lang: Lang: You sure about that? Take a look at the pup's face. Shaun: .............. Lang: He looks pretty shaken up to me. Edgeworth: (It looks like he hit the mark... but Shaun doesn't want to talk about it.) Lang: If he doesn't feel like talking, then I have an idea of my own. Let's check the tape. Edgeworth: Agent Lang. What is your intention? Lang: The police have a device that lets you analyze the video footage up close and personal. Gravelle: Agent Lang. You would suspect Shaun enough to go that far... Edgeworth: (As long as Shaun's lips are sealed... ...this may be the only way for us to get closer to the truth.) Detective Gumshoe! If I'm not mistaken you have that device with you, correct? Gumshoe: Mr. Analysis is ready to go, sir! Lang: Now we're talking! Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth. Would you please perform the video analysis for us? Edgeworth: (She wants me to do it...?) Gravelle: Who knows what kind of faults that wolf-man will find in it! Edgeworth: (This isn't exactly my strong suit, but I suppose I have no choice... Are there any new clues shown on the video?) Monster costume Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It's the Moozilla costume. If you zoom in, you can see that the back is unzipped. Kay: Yeah. Mr. Powers was supposed to get inside to play the monster in the movie. ...But, I don't really get it. The Mozilla in the movie is supposed to be big enough to demolish an entire building. Once he's inside the costume, how does he activate its megazord form? Edgeworth: ...I think you have a big misunderstanding. The costume doesn't actually become big. Kay: I see. So what's big is not the costume, but the misunderstanding. Hmm... I think I kinda get it now. Thanks! Edgeworth: (Does she really understand...?) Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Dirt ground Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Blaised Debeste used the tools in his garage to dig up something. Kay: There was a huge hammer in his garage too. Edgeworth: Indeed. That was probably used to break the concrete. As it turns out, these weren't Moozilla's footprints at all. Are you disappointed? Kay: A Great Thief needs to have the strength to accept the truth, no matter how hard it is. I must become stronger. Much, much stronger! Edgeworth: (...I guess she couldn't handle the truth.) Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Di-Jun Huang (after zooming) Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(Th-This is...!)\" Anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's nothing of interest here. Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Edgeworth: (Th-This is...!) Kay: What's the matter? I wanna see too! ...Hm? Eeeeeeeeeek! Lang: Hey! What's wrong!? Show it to me! Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth! I request you submit the evidence to the court! Edgeworth: ...Please take a look at the top right corner of the zoomed-in video. Lang: Th-This... This person is...! ...th-the presideeeeeent! Gravelle: Impossible! Shaun: Huh!? N-No way! Lang: It seems we've finally found it at last. The evidence that points to the true killer...! Edgeworth: (This video places Shaun at a major disadvantage...!) Shaun: Y-You're wrong! That's not right! I didn't know anything about this! Lang: That's not gonna cut it. It's clear that you and the victim were together at the same place where his body was later found! Shaun Fenn! There's no doubt. You killed the president! Gravelle: N-No! This can't be...! Why, why would you...? Shaun... please don't tell me... Did you really kill the president? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Is this really decisive evidence...? Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. Looks like even you can't object to this. Edgeworth: (Ngh...!) Lang: That pup said he didn't know anything, right? And yet, the president's right here in the video! Shaun: ........ Edgeworth: Shaun! What are you hiding? Gravelle: Shaun...! Please tell us the truth! Shaun: .......... The truth is... The truth is... It's all my fault... Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! What did you do!? Shaun: M-M-Moozilla's head falling was all my fault! -- During the Rehearsal -- Shaun: While I was setting up the equipment on the roof, I used the heater... After that, I went down to practice, but I forgot to turn it off. Then my mom called me, so I left the film lot. When I came back to the lot, after the phone call was over... Moozilla's head that was on the roof had fallen... And right next to it was the president, lying dead on the ground... Gravelle: H-How can that be...? Edgeworth: I see. There were indeed traces that something had caught fire on the rooftop. Shaun: ..It was just a small fire, so I was able to put it out by myself. Kay: So... the president's death was Shaun's fault? Gumshoe: But, wouldn't that make this an accident, sir? Edgeworth: ...And then, what did you do with the fallen head? Shaun: I took it apart, brought the pieces up to the roof, and put it back together. Lang: Lang: So, you put out the fire, and even put the fallen head back on the roof. Which means you were hiding evidence... We can't be having that, you naughty little pup. Shaun: I didn't do it on purpose! I really did just forget to turn off the heater... Edgeworth: When the legs broke, the stand would have tilted. If Moozilla's head was on top of the stand... Kay: ...it would've fallen off! So, the head fell down because of the fire! Edgeworth: Yes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness. Lang: Lang: ...Was it really just an accident? If that's the truth, then what was the president doing here? Shaun: I-I don't know! There was no one else around when I was there! Lang: You expect me to believe that!? The president wouldn't have just come to a place like this without a reason, you know! Edgeworth: (Indeed, the president's reason for coming here is still a huge mystery... Two nights ago, he met with Judge Gravelle on the roof of the Grand Tower... ...and last night, he was here at the film lot. Did he meet with Shaun...? I'll have to listen to Shaun's testimony very carefully...!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. You are still young. I know it can get a little cold in early spring, but you shouldn't have to resort to a heater... Gravelle: Gravelle: It is precisely because he is young that he must make sure to take good care of himself! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: However, while it can get a bit chilly during this time of year, I wouldn't necessarily say... Shaun: Hold it, old man. Is this really the right time to be having this argument? Edgeworth: G..... Gah! (He's completely right.) Gravelle: Shaun. You did well to get the better of Mr. Edgeworth, but please mind your language. Edgeworth: (Let's not forget that he got the better of you too, Your Honor...) Shaun: I-I know, Mom... So, umm... where was I? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You forgot to turn off the heater? You didn't check it before leaving the roof? Shaun: I meant to turn it off, but I was too focused on practicing, so... And come on, everyone forgets stuff like that sometimes! Kay: Yeah, I gotcha! I forget small things like that all the time too! Like sometimes, I'll forget to turn off the AC or the lights in Mr. Edgeworth's office... ...or I'll jump off the ladder for his bookshelves, or leave prank calls on his answering machine. But forgetting to turn off the heater is really dangerous, so you've gotta be careful! Edgeworth: (Some of those things had nothing to do with forgetfulness...) Shaun. Please continue. Shaun: Looks like you've got it rough too, old man. Well, back to my story... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It was late at night at the film lot... and not a single member of the film crew was around. So then, why did you have to leave the premises in order to answer the phone call? Shaun: I totally forgot about the phone call thing... so I kinda panicked. If I didn't answer it fast, I would have been busted for leaving the hotel without permission. Edgeworth: In that case, why didn't you just answer it here? Shaun: B-Because I was rehearsing, all the cameras and mics were on. If I talked here, every last word I said to Mom would've been caught on camera! Edgeworth: (So he was embarrassed that the conversation with his mother would be recorded.) Shaun: Anyways, I stopped practicing for a bit and rushed out of the film lot. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that phone call, you lied and said you were at the hotel, correct? Kay: Why didn't you tell your mom that you were rehearsing? Shaun: If I told her that, she would've called the hotel and made them send me a taxi or something. Gravelle: Gravelle: Of course I would have! A child alone on the streets at the time of night... What sort of parent would allow their child to be in such a dangerous situation!? Edgeworth: Hmm. I guess kids just don't understand how their parents feel. Kay: It goes both ways, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Now then, Shaun. Please tell us about what happened after the phone call. Shaun: Huh? O-Oh yeah. Of course. When the call was finished and I came back here... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was there any indication that the head was about to fall? Shaun: ...I-I don't know. I was focused on my rehearsal. Edgeworth: So you forgot to turn off the heater, which led to a fire on the roof. I would think you should have at least heard something. Shaun: Heard something...? Oh, I was wearing headphones, so... Edgeworth: Headphones? Shaun: Listening to the movie's soundtrack helps me get into the scene... I had it on full blast. That's why I didn't hear anything. Edgeworth: And yet, you noticed your mother's incoming call? Shaun: I had my phone on vibrate, old man. That's how I noticed. Anyways, the head had fallen... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What was the state of the body? Shaun: ...I didn't get a good look. 'Cause it was dark. ........ Edgeworth: (Hm? He's suddenly become as quiet as a mouse.) Kay: I guess Shaun doesn't really want to remember anything about the body... Edgeworth: (...Is that the only reason why he's gone so quiet? Should I press him for more details?) Press him further Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Leave him be Edgeworth: (It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.) Edgeworth: You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead? Shaun: ! Th-That's... well... Edgeworth: (He's clearly shaken. ...He must be hiding something.) Wouldn't you normally call for help if you see someone collapsed on the ground? However, you did nothing of the sort... Shaun: But... But he...! He was already dead... Edgeworth: Is that so? You seem quite certain that the president was already dead... Now, is there a reason for that, I wonder? Shaun: The guy was collapsed on the ground, and right next to him was the fallen monster's head. I'm not stupid. It wasn't hard to imagine what happened... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You can imagine whatever you want, but there was no way for you to know that he was dead! You actually checked to make sure the president was dead, didn't you? Shaun: Urk.....! Y-Yeah... that's right! I was scared... but I got up close to the body and checked to see if he was breathing. Edgeworth: (I thought as much... However, why would he hide that? There must be a reason...) ...Please tell me the state of the body at that time. Shaun: A-At first, I didn't know he was dead... I would've realized sooner if there had been any blood... ...but there wasn't a single drop, and his clothes were completely spotless. Either way, he wasn't breathing. That's how I knew he was already dead... Edgeworth: ...Would you please append those statements to your testimony? Add statements: \"I didn't know right away that he was dead. There was no blood, and his clothes were spotless.\" and \"But he wasn't breathing at all when I checked, so I knew he was already dead.\" Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Edgeworth: (It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you knew immediately that it was the president? Shaun: Not right away. It was dark, so I had to get a bit closer. But... I knew his face because we worked together briefly, after all. Kay: Y-You worked with the president!? Wow, Shaun...! When did you do that!? Edgeworth: Have you already forgotten, Kay? The president had a cameo in this movie. Kay: Ah! That's right! Of course... N-Now I remember! Edgeworth: Good for you. So, Shaun. You confirmed he was dead? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were unable to tell if he was dead because of the lack of stains on his clothes... Are you certain of that? Shaun: Of course I am. You guys saw the body too, right? So what's the big ideal!? Edgeworth: You said that the area was dark. And yet, you were still able to make that observation? Shaun: I'm telling you, there wasn't a single stain on his entire body! Give it a rest, old man! Edgeworth: Heh... Thank you, Shaun. That was all I needed to hear. Kay: Are clean clothes that important to you, Mr. Edgeworth? Mine are freshly washed though! Edgeworth: Next... could you tell me how you determined that the president was dead? Shaun: Well, there wasn't anything to let me know right away that he was dead, you see... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did you check if he had stopped breathing? Shaun: They taught us how at school. You get right up close to the person's nose... ...and check to see if you can feel their breath. I never thought I'd have to do it for real, though... Kay: That was really brave of you, to be able to do something like that. Shaun, you sure are amazing for an elementary school kid. Edgeworth: Kay, he's in middle school. Please try to get that into your head sometime soon... Kay: It'd be pretty scary to see a corpse just suddenly appear out of the blue like that... Not to mention the fallen monster head lying next to the body. Edgeworth: Panic would certainly be an understandable response to such a situation. Kay: But still, all things considered... This was just an accident, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. That is, if we decide to take Shaun's words at face value... (I wouldn't mind having some more concrete details on the state of the crime scene...)-- Kanis's Savior -- Kanis: Certainly, it was I who killed President Huang. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You admitted that rather easily. Kanis: These days, I have long grown tired of killing. ...Keh heh heh. But in those halcyon days, I devoted myself to the path of an executioner. If one cannot admit that much, what can he admit? Right, Anubis? Yes, yes, my boy. Kay: I feel like he's saying something scary, but it's kind of hard to understand him! Edgeworth: This fallen priest is saying he has no feelings about the president's death. (Kanis, the assassin and escaped prisoner. He should be a despicable opponent, but... ...silencing him now would be imprudent. I must keep my composure and let him talk!) I understand your point. ...You killed the president. Kanis: That is correct. The aim of my blade never misses its mark. Kanis: However, my life was also targeted on that day. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your life was targeted? You, the assassin? Kay: The hunter becomes the hunted. The Buddhist becomes the Buddha. Edgeworth: Kay, you don't have to make up strange proverbs. Kanis: ...Life is transient. Especially for an assassin, whose life is always exposed to danger. Kay: So, does that mean people you've tried to kill have fought back? Kanis: That is a rare occurrence... However, this was different. Kanis: The body double, Blaise, and Fifi all sought to seal my lips. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Bodhidharma Kanis. You are a master assassin. As such, could you not have evaded an attack from those three and fled the scene...? Kanis: Keh heh heh. You greatly overestimate me. Without Anubis by my side, I would not even be able to walk about. If those three were to attack me all at once, I would not stand a chance. Edgeworth: I see. So even an assassin will fall to superior numbers in a frontal assault. Kanis: I suppose one could say that. I, Bodhidharma Kanis, would have suffered a shameful defeat. Kanis: Had I not been reunited with the young acolyte back then, I would have been in danger. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Reunited...? So, when did you first meet with him? Kanis: That would be 18 years ago, on the 24th of December. Edgeworth: (That is a rather long time ago...) Kanis: On that day, our roles were reversed. I saved the young one's life. There was an unusual snowstorm on that day. The temperature was well below freezing. I took Anubis for a walk in the snow. That's when Anubis noticed something and started running. I followed after him and found a car. I had great difficulty opening the door. It had frozen shut. In the back seat... there were two young children, shivering from the cold. Edgeworth: Two children? Kanis: Had they remained in the car for an hour longer, they surely would have frozen to death. I brought the two of them to a nearby orphanage... Edgeworth: (Is there anything about Kanis's story that concerns me?) There is something Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Leave him be Edgeworth: (I don't think there's anything in particular that stands out...) Kanis, please continue your testimony. Edgeworth: (What concerns me is...) The date Leads to: \"The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that?\" The number of children Edgeworth: There were two children in the car... you're sure of that? Kanis: It may have been 18 years ago, but I remember it clearly. There were two children in the car, there is no mistaking it. Does the good prosecutor have a problem with that number? Edgeworth: (Right now, the number of children isn't what I have a problem with.) Kanis: Are we done talking about this subject yet? Leads back to: \"(What concerns me is...)\" The model of the car Edgeworth: What was the model of the car the children were in? Kanis: The model of the car? What would you want to know that for? It was a typical mid-size car, the kind you see everywhere. Other than the freezing children sitting inside, there was nothing unusual about it. Edgeworth: (...Looks like the car model is of no real importance.) Kanis: Are we done talking about this subject yet? Leads back to: \"(What concerns me is...)\" Edgeworth: The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that? Kanis: There is no mistake. Ray: C-Could that mean...!? Edgeworth: (I know... the significance behind that date.) What shows the significance of the date when Kanis found the children? Present IS-7 Incident Documents Edgeworth: Leads to: \"That day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence is connected to that date, isn't it? Kay: Ummm... How exactly is it connected? Kanis: I don't know what the good prosecutor brought out... ...but I can sense that there is no real connection behind it. Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (Kanis saw through it.) Kay: Mr. Kanis found the children on December 24th! Let's try looking at the evidence again with that date in mind! Leads back to: \"(I know... the significance behind that date.)\" Kanis: But alas, even to this day, I do not know what has become of the young acolyte... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And now you're searching for the boy from all those years ago? Surely, you're not saying you want to thank him for saving you? Kanis: Keh heh heh... Well, who knows. However, the young one did save my life. That is the truth. Even Anubis took a liking to him. He would do tricks for him, such as \"shake\" or \"roll over\". Kay: I thought that the tricks Kanis taught his dog were a little bit different from the norm, though. Kanis: You are right about that. For Anubis, \"roll over\" means first biting the victim's foot... Kay: Stop! Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear any more! Kanis: Keh heh heh... There is no need to worry, I only showed the young one ordinary tricks. Edgeworth: (...Hmm. I get the feeling that Kanis, in his own way, felt indebted to the boy.) Kay: Mr. Kanis and that \"acolyte\" seem to share a complicated relationship, huh. Edgeworth: Perhaps there is a hint to the mastermind's motive hidden somewhere in his testimony. Kanis is one of the few people who knows the mastermind first hand... Let's try to draw out as much information as possible from him. Edgeworth: That day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered. Kay: Ah! Edgeworth: During that incident, two young boys went missing. The sons of the victim, Isaac Dover, and the culprit, Dane Gustavia... Ray: We never did find out where those two boys went after the case 18 years ago... Kanis: Oh? They were the sons of a victim and a culprit? It all makes sense now. Edgeworth: What makes sense? Kanis: One of the youths was bound, so that he could not move. Kay: Mr. Dover did it so that Mr. Gustavia's son couldn't come to the contest venue. Edgeworth: Indeed. Gustavia was using his own son as a taste tester. Kanis: Keh heh heh heh. To think that was what transpired. Neither child seemed to recall what had happened. Edgeworth: They lost their memories? Kanis: The acolyte told me this when we were reunited 12 years ago. The pair were placed in an extreme situation, on the verge of freezing to death... That trauma led them both to suffer from amnesia. Neither could so much as remember his own name. Kay: So they didn't even know that they were the sons of Mr. Dover and Mr. Gustavia. Edgeworth: Indeed, while we cannot say it conclusively, the probability is quite high. (However, we still don't have enough information to deduce the mastermind's identity...) Kanis... Would you please continue your story? Kanis: Keh heh. Very well. -- Kanis and the \"Acolyte\" -- Kanis: I continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison. Recently, that has all come to an abrupt halt, however. It left me quite concerned. Furthermore, those involved in the crime 12 years ago were all drawn into incidents one by one. I grew more and more curious. And so I absconded briefly from the prison. Edgeworth: Those involved 12 years ago... ...were Fifi Laguarde, Blaise Debeste, and President Huang's body double. Kay: And Ms. Laguarde was the warden of Mr. Kanis's prison. Kanis: Keh heh heh. I blackmailed the warden. That woman had tried to kill me. Perhaps the good prosecutor has already deduced the reason? Edgeworth: You murdered President Huang... However, the world still believed he was alive. If you were able to prove the president was a fake... ...both Fifi Laguarde and Blaise Debeste would have been in danger. Kanis: That is correct. And I had heard the proof with my own ears. I'll be waiting in the courtyard of the orphanage at midnight on February 9th. Even if it's just once, I want Shaun to be able to meet you. I'm sorry if I'm being selfish, but... I'll be waiting. Huang: ...Who might you be? My apologies, but I am presently waiting for someone... Kanis: Keh heh heh. I am well aware of that... President Huang. Are you not meeting with your son? However, I do not spill blood needlessly. You may relax. I seek only the president's life. Huang: .........It can't be. P-Please wait. I am just about to meet my son for the first time. I'm sure this will be the first and the last time. Please, at least wait until we are finished... Kanis: I had thought the president would beg for his life, but he was of a different sort. Officially, the president had no son. However, he shook his head and said... ...this illegitimate son was his, and he intended to recognize him publicly. Furthermore, he claimed that he had already made preparations towards that end... Would that son of his be the boy with horns over there by any chance? Kay: Boy... with the horns? Wait, you can see Shaun's horns? Kanis: Keh heh heh. There is no need to see them. From the moment I escaped from prison until now... ...I have been closely lending an ear to your voices. Edgeworth: (He said that the president made \"preparations\" towards recognizing his son... ...but the word \"preparations\" alone would be insufficient for blackmail.) ........That's it! Lang: There was one thing that could prove Huang's words: the will held by the House of Lang. It was also proof of his trust in us. His son's existence would've been revealed to the world. Kanis: The name on the recording, the mention of preparations, and the will in Zheng Fa... Keh heh heh. Together, they sufficed to make the Warden bow to my words. Edgeworth: (With those three pieces of information, one could prove the identity of the double... ...by using Shaun!) Shaun: .......... Kanis: The president blocked the first strike of my knife with something soft. As pieces of it fell atop the snow, I struck once more. This time, the blow proved fatal. Edgeworth: (So Kanis cut off the Moozilla doll's horn...) Kanis: None but I heard his final words. Only myself and that child knew of the president's secret son. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In other words, you contacted him from prison? Kanis: Keh heh heh. That is correct. A post-office box was used. Kay: A post-office box...? Edgeworth: It would allow one to send and receive letters without revealing the recipient's location. Kanis: I could not use a form of correspondence that would reveal the acolyte's location. ...There was someone keeping watch over my correspondences, after all. Edgeworth: (He must mean the prison warden... Fifi Laguarde.) Could you be more specific about the nature of your correspondences? Kanis: Well. They were mainly moves from my correspondence chess matches. Kay: C-Correspondence chess? If I recall, the person you were playing against... Edgeworth: This might be hard to believe... but Kanis's chess opponent was... Kay: Ah! Are you saying he was playing against Mr. Knightley? Wasn't it Horace Knightley? Edgeworth: We certainly found the correspondence chess memo in Knightley's cell. Correspondence Chess Memo jotted down in my Organizer. Ray: Does that mean... Knightley-boy was the kid from the IS-7 Incident? Edgeworth: (Could... that really be true? Is there any evidence connecting Knightley to the IS-7 Incident?) Present Knightley's Mementos Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence. Ray: What about it? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think it has anything to do with the incident at all, though. Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (Perhaps I should think it over one more time?) Ray: Why don't you look over Knightley-boy's belongings one more time? Something related to the IS-7 Incident just might pop out! Edgeworth: (Knightley's belongings, huh? Let's look over them one more time...) Edgeworth: (This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within? Which should I investigate? The ring or the chessboard...?) The ring Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" The chessboard Edgeworth: (Obviously, we should investigate the chessboard.) Ray: Huh? Miles, what are you doing taking out the chessboard? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think the chessboard has anything to do with the IS-7 Incident. Edgeworth: Argh! (He may be right... In that case, the only piece of evidence left to investigate is...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: This ring is...! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, what is it? Edgeworth: Mr. Shields, please take a look at this ring! Ray: Th-This pattern is... It's Pierre Hoquet's! Edgeworth: I thought so... He had Mr. Dover's seal turned into a ring. However, why would he have this? Shouldn't it have been held by the police as evidence from the IS-7 Incident? Ray: After the incident, the seal was returned to the victim's next-of-kin. And Mr. Dover's only family was his son. But since no one knew where the son had gone to, it took a while to get it to him. I'd heard that the police had finally found him and delivered his inheritance, but... Edgeworth: ...So the seal was thereby safely delivered to his son. And then, he turned the seal into a ring and wore it on his person. Knightley's Mementos data updated in my Organizer. Kay: So... Mr. Knightley was Mr. Dover's son... Ray: The police aren't fools. I'm sure they did a thorough check before handing over the seal. Kay: If someone involved in the IS-7 Incident was his chess opponent... Lang: Knightley, huh. Then that man must be the mastermind behind this case! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But, Knightley is dead! He cannot be involved in this incident. Ray: How about that. The only one who could be the mastermind was himself a murder victim...? Kay: But a dead guy can't be the culprit! So there's no way that's right! Edgeworth: (It certainly is strange... In that case, who is the culprit?) Add statement: \"Writing letters in braille can be a rather enjoyable pastime.\" Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence. Ray: What about it? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think it has anything to do with the incident at all, though. Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (Perhaps I should think it over one more time?) Ray: Why don't you look over Knightley-boy's belongings one more time? Something related to the IS-7 Incident just might pop out! Edgeworth: (Knightley's belongings, huh? Let's look over them one more time...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: (Obviously, we should investigate the chessboard.) Ray: Huh? Miles, what are you doing taking out the chessboard? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think the chessboard has anything to do with the IS-7 Incident. Edgeworth: Argh! (He may be right... In that case, the only piece of evidence left to investigate is...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That was your means of playing correspondence chess. You used chess notation for your moves. Kanis: Keh heh heh... as expected, the good prosecutor has done a thorough investigation. Kay: His chess opponent was Horace Knightley, right? Edgeworth: The ring Knightley wore... Mr. Shields, please have a close look at it. Ray: Yeah, there's no mistake. This is the evidence from the IS-7 Incident. The police found Mr. Dover's son and returned it to him. If you're saying that the son was Knightley, then... ...the acolyte, who was Kanis's chess opponent and the mastermind, was Knightley? Edgeworth: No, Knightley has already been murdered. He cannot be at the center of the incident. There is no doubt that the mastermind is still hiding somewhere out there. Kay: ...Well then, Mr. Kanis. Sorry to have kept you waiting. Kanis: Hmm... that was a rather interesting tale. Wasn't it, Anubis? I shall continue my story about the acolyte. Our longstanding chess match continued... Edgeworth: (It seems she's not much good with the assassin's dog.) Kanis: Good boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It came to a halt? Now, of all times? Kanis: Quite odd, is it not? Anubis told me again and again how odd it was. Kay: That scary dog talked? Was he like, \"Something's odd, woof!\"? Kanis: Keh heh heh. I can understand Anubis's heart, even if he does not voice his thoughts. Kay: Umm... Then, there's something I'd like to ask, just in case. Your scary dog's staring at me right now... He's not saying, \"I'm hungry. I want some meat\", right? Kanis: Keh heh heh... Perhaps. Kay: P... Perhaps... Aaaaah... M-Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (It seems she's not much good with the assassin's dog.) Kanis: Good boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That certainly does seem too much for a mere coincidence. The body double of Di-Jun Huang, the president of Zheng Fa faked an assassination plot. Fifi Laguarde, the prison warden, murdered Horace Knightley. And Blaise Debeste, the Chairman of the P.I.C, murdered Jill Crane. (Come to think of it, as I have been investigating these cases... ...I have felt the presence of some force behind the scenes.) Kanis: Keh heh heh. Even within the prison, I could tell that this was no insignificant event. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You absconded briefly from prison? I cannot forgive such a criminal act! Kay: You stole your way out of prison? I cannot forgive such a thieving act! Kanis: Keh heh heh... Relax. No one was hurt. I merely have connections that allow me to set foot outside. Gumshoe: B-But even so, you can't just escape from prison, pal! Arrest him! Arrest him! Kanis: That won't be necessary. Once my business is done, I shall return to my cell. Lang: ...You trying to make fools of us? A prison isn't the kind of place you can just enter and leave at will! Kanis: Keh heh heh. The Wolf may say that... ...but one can see that the Wolf and his pack also share an interest in the tales of my past. Lang: Tch...! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, Detective Gumshoe. There are still a few things I must ask Kanis. Please postpone matters until then. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I knew you'd say that, Mr. Edgeworth! Lang: Dammit all... But I'm not taking my eye off you for a second! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Excuse me, but you wrote your letters in braille? Kanis: Indeed. For I possess the tools necessary to write in braille. Kay: Wow. So you need to use tools to write in braille. I never knew. Edgeworth: Then, would you please tell us what you wrote? Kanis: Everything. Letters, of course, and also the movements of the chess pieces. Edgeworth: (He wrote the movements of the chess pieces by hand? That statement is... intriguing.) Kay: So then, how does your handmade dog piece move? Edgeworth: Kay, that question can wait. So then... what did you do when the letters stopped coming? Kanis: Keh heh heh... Within the prison, I grew increasingly concerned about the acolyte's whereabouts. Kay: OK, OK... Umm... But even so, I don't really get it. Who exactly is this \"acolyte\"? Edgeworth: Indeed. Kanis himself has not yet made that clear. (What's important is the thread connecting Kanis and this \"acolyte\": their correspondence. And not just the letters. We should pay attention to the means that was used as well.)-- Kanis and the \"Acolyte\" -- Kanis: I continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison.

Edgeworth: The correspondence chess letter we found had been typed out using a word processor. Kanis: What? That... cannot be. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Kay: So, someone went of their way to retype the letters on a computer? Edgeworth: Could another person have acted as a middleman between Kanis and Knightley? Kay: What do you mean? Edgeworth: Kanis wrote his letters in braille. However... ...by the time it reached Knightley, it had been rewritten on a word processor. ...We must assume that some middleman rewrote those letters. Ray: And the reverse can also be said. That same somebody might've taken the letters Knightley wrote and redelivered them to Kanis. Edgeworth: Yes, that is indeed true. Correspondence Chess Memo updated in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Knightley and Kanis both communicated through a certain individual... Kanis, were the letters that reached you... Kanis: They were in braille, of course. Ray: So Knightley-boy's letters must have been transposed by that same person as well. Kanis: Oh...? Then that somebody must be... Edgeworth: ...the mastermind behind the case. Lang: Lang: You're saying there's someone else who's the mastermind behind this case!? Then who the hell is it!? Edgeworth: Dover's son, Knightley, is already deceased. In that case, there is one more youth that we should consider to be the mastermind. Lang: You mean, Dane Gustavia's son...? But, who the heck is he? Edgeworth: (If Knightley is Dover's son, then Gustavia's son must be...) ???: Well, we're the only friends either of us has had since childhood... He was... the same as me. We never had real families. Edgeworth: (It can't be... could it? Could it really be him?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, what is it? You've gone all pale! Edgeworth: I've figured it out... ...The identity of the mastermind who's been controlling this case from the shadows! Kay: Whaaaat!? Who in the world is it!? Edgeworth: I don't want to believe it myself... but it is someone we know quite well. The mastermind is...! Present Simeon Saint profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\" Present anyone else Edgeworth: Kay: Whaaat!? That person is the mastermind!? But, according to what we've been saying, something seems kinda wrong... Edgeworth: ...Naturally. This person has no relation to the mastermind, after all. Kay: Are they related or not!? Please take this more seriously! Edgeworth: Argh! (I have to think carefully... Knightley is Dover's son. In that case, Gustavia's son is...) Regina: Mr. Knightley was his only childhood friend. Edgeworth: (It must be this person!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Who is the mastermind behind this case? Leads back to: \"The mastermind is...!\" Edgeworth: (The mastermind behind this case... ...sent a letter to Jill Crane, which deceived Blaise. Furthermore, he kidnapped Shaun and eavesdropped on us. However, of all his actions, the one I have not been able to get out of my mind... ...is how he brought an unconscious Kay to the roof.) ...............The Giant Monster. Kay: Huh? ...Did you just say something? Edgeworth: (That's right. The key to exposing the mastermind... is in the monster's true form.) Simeon: Ah... I-I almost forgot! Um, if you'd like... Please come to our next show! I-I'll also... be performing in it. Regina: The Berry Big Circus is always fabulous and fun for all ages! Edgeworth: Ms. Swift, there is something I would like to ask of you. Nicole: Wh-What! Ya mean me? Edgeworth: You said that you recorded the sound of Moozilla spewing flames. Edgeworth: ...Would this decisive evidence of yours be something you recorded on that tape recorder? Nicole: That's Mr. Edgeworth for ya! Yer good at figurin' things out, aren't ya!? It's the sound of Moozilla spewin' out fire. This place nearly became a sea of flames! Nicole: That's right. I ain't actually seen it with my own eyes, though... Edgeworth: Could you let us listen to the tape? Nicole: Sure thing. ...There we go! Edgeworth: (This sound, it's as I thought...! So, it seems that my reasoning was correct. The true nature of the monster and the mastermind... all of my logic is coming together!) Ms. Hart! You said that you captured a giant eye on film, did you not? Lotta: Sure did, right here in this photo. Edgeworth: (Though we cannot confirm it like this...) Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Lend us your film analysis device! Gumshoe: OK, but... What do you want to analyze, sir? Edgeworth: This photo, please! Gumshoe: I'm on it! Edgeworth: (Is there a new clue in this photo?) Present giant eyeball (after zooming) Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Th-This is...!\" Present Jill Crane Edgeworth: Kay: I can't really tell since the person is wearing a raincoat... ...but, this should be Ms. Crane before she died, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. She was Mr. Cameron's love interest. He was murdered 12 years ago. Kay: And she was murdered while investigating the mysteries of that past case... I'm sure she must've been very sad and frustrated by all that happened... We're... gonna finish what Ms. Crane set out to do! Right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Indeed. That was my intention all along. Just leave it to me. Leads back to: \"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)\" Present ladder Edgeworth: Kay: Ah! It's a ladder! We climbed up this ladder earlier, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, we did. (...Countless times since yesterday.) Kay: Take a look at this ladder... It's not bad, per se, but you can see how the gap between the steps is a little too wide. And these handrails would be way easier to grasp if they were just a bit more rounded. And also, the steps don't fell quite right when you're climbing on them for some reason. Hmm. I don't want to be too critical, so I'll give it around... 198 points! Edgeworth: (...Out of what?) Leads back to: \"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's nothing unusual about this area. Leads back to: \"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)\" Gumshoe: Th-This is...! Lotta: See!? Ain't the Moozilla's eye right where I said it would be!? Edgeworth: Heh... I see. I have finally grasped... ...the true form of the giant monster that was being controlled by the mastermind! Lotta: .......G Nicole: .....G-G Gumshoe: ...G-G-G Kay: Giant Monster!? Lotta: A-Are ya admittin' it? You are, ain't ya!? Yer admittin' that the Mighty Moozilla is real! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: No... This is not Moozilla. This is the eye of a different monster. Please have a look at this. Kay: It's a flyer for the Berry Big Circus...? Aah! Th-This is...! Edgeworth: Precisely. There is a rather large balloon with the head of a lion pictured here. This balloon is the true identity of the Giant Monster! In addition, the sound Ms. Swift recorded, which she believes to be Moozilla spewing flames... Nicole: Mr. Prosecutor... don't tell me, yer gonna say somethin' that'll shatter my dreams of a scoop... Gumshoe: Hot air balloons fly by using burners to hear the air, right, sir? Edgeworth: Precisely, Detective. The mastermind used this monster of his... ...to bring Kay to the rooftop of the Grand Tower without using the elevator! Kay: Wouldn't that mean... that the mastermind is someone connected to the circus? Ray: He's a member of the circus, Knightley's friend, and... Dane Gustavia's son. Wh... Who'd have thunk it...!? Edgeworth: An apprentice beast tamer? Heh..... He's no amateur. For the beast he has tamed is none other than this entire case! Simeon Saint! He is the mastermind behind this whole incident! Kay: M-Mr. Saint... was really behind it all...? N-No way...! I don't believe it! I mean, we trusted him! How could it all have been a lie!? That's just... heartbreaking... Edgeworth: Kay..... Edgeworth: Hm...? What is it? Shaun: Hey, you! Stop! Where do you think you're going!? Kanis: Keh heh heh heh... The boy with horns is rather perceptive. ...The good prosecutor has done a remarkable job. Now that I have heard that, I have no further business here. Edgeworth: What... Wait! Kanis! Grrr... *ruff, ruff!* Lang: Dammit! Where'd he vanish to!? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Are you OK!? Edgeworth: Yes, I'm fine. However... Shaun: .....That guy...! Edgeworth: ...Shaun? Shaun: That Kanis guy... he's the one who killed my dad, right? Edgeworth: (There is no question more difficult to answer. However...) There's no use in denying the truth. Yes, Shaun... You are correct. Shaun: He'll pay for this... I swear he's gonna pay...! I... I'll make him pay myse... Gravelle: Gravelle: Shaun! You mustn't finish that thought! ...Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please pay us no mind. Edgeworth: ...... Gumshoe: Sir! I've put out an APB on Kanis! All available police units will be searching for him! Lang: ...You heard the man, kid. I don't mean to be heartless, but we need to hurry, too. So Mr. Prosecutor, where's the mastermind right now? Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang is right. Our top priority right now should be catching the mastermind. He said he would be practicing. He is most likely at the Berry Big Circus tent. But first... Agent Lang, I have a request. Lang: A request...? What is it? Edgeworth: Now that we've identified the Giant Monster, our next order of business... is to capture it. The moment we arrive at the tent, I need you to locate that specific item posthaste. And Detective, I ask that you perform a follow-up investigation on the kidnapping incident. Gumshoe: Roger that, sir! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth. I wanna help out too! Edgeworth: Hmm. In that case, you'll be in charge of calling for backup. If he is truly the mastermind, we may require assistance from a certain someone... (I met him so many times, yet his facade always fooled me into sympathy. He may have got the better of me in the past... but this time, I'll settle it once and for all!) To be continued. April 6, 5:30 PMBerry Big CircusStorage Tent Regina: Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Simeon: Are you guys here for the show? Edgeworth: Mr. Saint... Ms. Berry... Simeon: You're a little early... I'm sorry, but we're still getting ready... But, I'm so happy you came! You remembered our promise! Edgeworth: Yes, I remembered... You asked us to come and see the show when you gave me this. Simeon: ...I'm so happy you came! Please enjoy yourselves! I'm sure my performance will surprise you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Your \"performance\" has already surprised me, Mr. Saint. Simeon: .......... Regina: Umm. But he hasn't performed yet... Edgeworth: Regina. Please have a look at this photo. Is this balloon the property of the Berry Big Circus? Regina: Ah! I-It is! Did you see it flying around somewhere? Edgeworth: It's highly likely that this balloon was used by the culprit in the case we are investigating. Regina: Huh!? Edgeworth: Who is in charge of the balloon? Regina: Well, th-that would be S-Simeon, but... A-Are you saying...!? Simeon: ......... Edgeworth: Mr. Saint. You flew this balloon in the middle of the night. Did you not? Simeon: ...I do occasionally practice alone at night. I'm not much of a pilot though. I'm... a little clumsy. Edgeworth: Heh. So for practice, you'll do something as challenging as flying a balloon at night? Wouldn't that be rather difficult for someone who is clumsy and \"not much of a pilot\"? Simeon: Then... what do you think I was doing, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: You brought Kay to the roof of the Grand Tower... ...in order to frame her for the murder of Jill Crane! Not a single security camera recorded Kay using the elevator. Therefore, the only way she could have gotten up there was through flight. And the only one who could have flown her up there... was you, Mr. Saint. Simeon: No way... Mr. Edgeworth, how can you say that? Edgeworth: That's not all. You drugged Shaun at the garbage pickup, and kidnapped him. Wasn't that why you were late when you came to watch the trial of Fifi Laguarde? Simeon: No way... I have no idea what you're saying. There's no way I could do things like that. Please believe me... Mr. Edgeworth, please! Edgeworth: I wanted to believe you. However... you have broken that trust yourself! Simeon: Th... That's horrible. Why would you say that? Didn't you once say that you would trust me? That you'd believe in me? Kay: Don't you worry about that. We're your allies! That's because... we're like birds of a feather! Right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (Birds of a feather, huh? ...I suppose that's true.) We have sufficient information about your past. I doubt you had a motive to kill Knightley. Rather, you are probably the most affected by his death. And I doubt someone as timid as you could work up the courage to murder someone. Alright. I'll get you out of here. ...We'll believe in you. Simeon: I'm so sad... Those words were all lies... Kay: I-It wasn't a lie! We really did trust you...! Simeon: Kay, even you? You said we were like birds of a feather, and yet... I'm hurt, Kay. You've hurt me deeply... Kay: I-I-I... oooooh... Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Maybe Simeon isn't a bad guy after all... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I see. So that's how you operate. I understand now, all too well. No matter who you face, you find an emotional weakness and exploit it. You guide each person towards the outcome you desire, without them even noticing it. That... is how you were able to mastermind the entire case! Simeon: ........ Edgeworth: I may have fallen for your tricks before... but, not this time. Simeon Saint. I indict you! Simeon: ...........Hmm. So, it's come to this after all. You were always so full of confidence, Mr. Edgeworth. But, I rather like that. Because now... I can rip that confidence to shreds. Hah... Good work, everyone. Edgeworth: (Ngh..... His personality has completely changed!) So, the animal tamer who could not tame animals... That was all a facade. This is the real Simeon Saint. Regina: S-Simeon! That's not... true, is it!? Simeon: Truth or lie... What difference does it make? Regina: Huh!? Simeon: Mr. Edgeworth's just made me a little upset, that's all. Keh heh heh heh. ...You'll take responsibility for upsetting me, right? -- Balloon Practice -- Simeon: It's true. I practiced with the balloon two nights ago. That photo must have been taken when the balloon and I passed near the building. I often fly around that area for advertising purposes. There's nothing unusual about that, right? Edgeworth: You often fly around the Grand Tower in the balloon? Simeon: Yeah. Even the circus needs to advertise. Edgeworth: Regina, is that true? Regina: Y-Yup. It was Simeon's job to advertise using the balloon. Most people who live around here should have seen it. Edgeworth: That balloon was used in the crime we were investigating. Simeon: Like I said, it's just a coincidence. I simply happened to pass by the Grand Tower when that photo was taken. Edgeworth: I shall determine whether or not it was a coincidence after I hear your full story. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the balloon launched from this tent? Simeon: There's a nice, big park near the Sunshine Coliseum. I always launch the balloon there. Edgeworth: I see. In that case, how do you transport the balloon to the park? Simeon: Well, it's too heavy to carry by hand. It weighs several hundred pounds. And yet, it can fly in the sky... Amazing, isn't it? Edgeworth: I asked you how you transported it. Now answer the question. Simeon: Aww, I can't even make some small talk...? You're mean, Mr. Edgeworth. I used a truck. The balloon is loaded onto the back of the truck. Edgeworth: A truck...? Simeon: Yeah. The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago. Edgeworth: (Hmm. I cannot overlook that piece of testimony...!) Add statement: \"The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Allow me to confirm... You haven't driven the truck since then? Simeon: Do you really need to confirm that? I mean, I just said it five seconds ago. Edgeworth: Answer the question. Or would it be inconvenient for you to do so? Simeon: Ha ha. That's a pretty weak provocation, coming from you, Mr. Edgeworth! What could be inconvenient about something I've already said? Fine, I get it... That truck has been parked behind the dressing rooms since two days ago. And the balloon and basket are still inside. Is there a problem? Edgeworth: There's no problem. I simply wanted to express my thanks for that piece of testimony. (So the truck was parked here for the past two days... Heh! That was exactly what I wanted to hear, Mr. Saint!) Simeon: ...May I continue? So then, regarding the balloon... }} Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You're saying it was simply a coincidence that you were photographed near the tower? Simeon: Ah, I get it. I know how you operate now, Mr. Edgeworth. You'll insist that a coincidence is impossible until you get your way. When you say it like that, everything will inevitably go your way! How scary! Kay: Ugh! You're wrong! Mr. Edgeworth isn't like that... Edgeworth: Kay, calm down. He's only trying to provoke an emotional response. He intends to goad us into losing our focus, in order to derail the topic at hand. ...Now, why do you think he would do that? Kay: Umm, because he's a clown...? No, I mean, because he's trying to hide something, I guess? Edgeworth: Exactly, Kay. We must not let up on him. However, we must continue to keep our composure... Understand? Kay: Yep! So, Simeon. Allow me, as the assistant, to ask you a question! When you passed by the Grand Tower at that precise moment, was it really just a coincidence? Simeon: ...We could've just left things at that. But... ...for the sake of your assistant, I shall explain my reason for being there. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, in addition to advertising with the balloon, maintaining the balloon is also your job. Am I wrong? Simeon: You're a real stickler for the details, y'know. Yeah, that's right. Ask the boss if you want. ...Right, Boss? Regina: Yup. Simeon is in charge of cleaning and fixing and all that stuff with the balloon. I don't think anyone besides Simeon has used the balloon for a while now. Edgeworth: (...Hmm. That confirms he was the one riding the balloon in the photo taken two days ago. However, if he is the mastermind, he must have used it today as well. Am I able to prove that?) Simeon: Looks like you're deep in thought... Is it really that hard to comprehend? Hot air balloons fly in the sky. And in other news, the sky is blue and the grass is green. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I wonder about that. You flew the balloon in the middle of the night, eerily close to a certain other incident... Would you say there's nothing strange about that, as well? Simeon: Mr. Edgeworth, isn't that like a really leading question? Won't you please stop being such a naughty prosecutor? It's kind of downer. It's a clown's job to put smiles on people's faces, after all. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He ducks and weaves around my questions skillfully. Very well. In that case, I will simply have to make use of a more direct attack!) Edgeworth: (We still don't know much about the balloon. In any case, I must draw out more information...)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Kay Faraday\nDescription: A self-styled Great Thief and so-called \"second Yatagarasu\" who's always looking to bag the greatest treasure of all -- the truth.\nCharacter 1\nName: Lotta Hart\nDescription: A freelance photojournalist who I've met in the past.

    "cot": "Testimony 0 states that Simeon practiced with the balloon two nights ago.  \nTestimony 1 states that the last time Simeon took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago.  \nThese two testimonies suggest the timeline of the balloon activity.  \n  \nEvidence 32 states that Simeon is in charge of a smaller balloon (Lion Hot Air Balloon) used for promotional purposes and that he drives it around on the back of a truck.  \n  \nTestimonies 0 and 1 are consistent with Evidence 32, as they all relate to the balloon and Simeon’s involvement.  \n  \nHowever, Simeon’s various testimonies (especially Testimony 4: \"There's nothing unusual about that, right?\") are attempts to downplay suspicion related to the balloon's presence near the crime scene.  \n  \nNo direct contradiction here.  \n  \nNext:  \n- Testimony 1: \"The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago.\"  \n- Simeon indicates in his dialogue that he was late watching the trial because of the kidnapping (the balloon must have been used at a time to facilitate the kidnapping).  \n  \nIf the kidnapping occurred last night (one day ago), yet Simeon says he took the truck and balloon out two days ago, that would be a contradiction. He cannot have used the balloon for the kidnapping last night if he claims the last time he took the truck and balloon out was two days ago.  \n\nTherefore:  \nEvidence 32 indicates Simeon is in charge of the balloon and truck and drives it around.  \nTestimony 1 says he last took out the truck and balloon two days ago.  \nBut other evidence/testimony suggests the balloon was used at or around the time of the kidnapping (which happened after two days ago).  \n  \nThus, Testimony 1 contradicts the implication from the timeline that Simeon used the balloon last night (which is not exactly from the testimonies, but from the implication of the case).\n\nBut since the question wants only one pair of contradicting \"evidence\" and \"testimony\", and from the materials, the conflicting pair is:\n\nTestimony 1: Simeon claims he last took the truck and balloon out two days ago.  \nFrom the story, the balloon was flown at night two days ago (evidence), and it was also used in relation to the kidnapping that happened recently (last night).  \n\nThis contradiction can be pinpointed specifically to evidence 32 (Lion Hot Air Balloon) and testimony 1.  \n\nHence, the pair is:  \nEvidence 32 and Testimony 1.  \n",

Kay: You can't stop thinking about what Mr. de Killer said, right? Edgeworth: Indeed... de Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Edgeworth: (This case isn't over yet... The person in the red hood who kidnapped Kay at Gourd Lake... And this letter from an unknown sender. Someone's schemes are at work behind this case...) Lotta: Must be tough havin' a case you just solved still naggin' at the back of yer mind. Well, I got some investigatin' of my own to be doin', so I'll be off! Kay: That's amazing! You've already decided on your next scoop? Lotta: What're ya sayin' there, missy!?

(Connecting \"Stepped on by a monster?\" and \"Monster's head\" Logic leads to:) Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. I'm going to take my leave here for a bit. There's something I have to check... Edgeworth: (Agent Lang. I wonder if he's caught onto something?) Hm? ???: ........ ........ Lang: ........ ???: .....Move it. Lang: What'd you say? Guess you're just a brat with no manners. ???: ...And you're an annoying old man. Quit your yapping already. Lang: ! Penny: I-I'm terribly sorry! Come on, Shaun! Lang: Tch! Penny: Oh! What were you doing!? ???: .......Who was that? Penny: Someone from the police! Why'd you suddenly pick a fight with him? ???: Hmph. Kay: That sure was a tense standoff! Edgeworth: (He didn't budge an inch, even before Agent Lang...) Penny: Ah! Allow me to introduce you! This is Shaun Fenn. He's the lead actor in our movie. Edgeworth: (The lead actor... is this child?) Kay: Hi! I'm Kay Faraday. Nice to meet you! Edgeworth: And this is Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth. Shaun: .......Prosecutor? Penny: He's a pretty famous prosecutor, you know. Shaun: But he's not wearing a prosecutor's badge. Edgeworth: Gah! (He's frightfully perceptive...) Penny: Ah! Shaun, it's probably better if you didn't go over there... Shaun: ............ Edgeworth: (That's certainly not a sight a child should see... However, he is someone involved with the case. I'll need to speak with him later.) (Connecting all possible Logic, examining ground around the body, original Moozilla model and table, clearing all \"Talk\" options of Penny and Shaun, and talking with Lotta leads to:) Edgeworth: And with that, this portion of the investigation seems to be finished. Kay: So the murder weapon really is... Edgeworth: Yes. As it stands now, the possibility that it was the monster head is quite high. Kay: So he ended up being squashed by the falling head, huh... Edgeworth: Hm? Lang: Although they're extremely late to the party, the bodyguards and the police have finally arrived. Bodyguard: Mr. President! Lang: They really were... far too late. Bodyguard: Damn it! Who did this!? Lang: ...They'll pay for this. I swear I'll make them pay. But you know, this much is enough to put me at ease. The person who did this to Huang... ...I've already got my eye on a suspect. Edgeworth: What? What do you mean? Lang: Even though Huang was the victim, he doesn't have extraterritorial rights here. Your country's police have the right to investigate. However, I've already spoken with them. As an agent of Interpol, they're letting me assist in the investigation... Edgeworth: ...So they've already established a plan for this investigation? Lang: I've already found my prey. Now it's time for the hunt... ...Take a look at this. It's a printout from a security camera on the Grand Tower rooftop. Edgeworth: Th... This is! Lang: This camera records people as they get off the rooftop elevator. And guess who was recorded? The president and his killer can be clearly seen! Kay: Wh-Why is Ms. Gravelle there!? Edgeworth: (So he's saying Judge Gravelle is the murder?) Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste! Edgeworth: (Could she, who hates crime more than anyone, have...?) Security Camera Photo jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. I'd like to hear your thoughts. Lang: Lang: ............ Just now, I heard a rumor at the Grand Tower. Miles Edgeworth, that you... are no longer a \"prosecutor\". Edgeworth: ! Lang: Naturally, that means you don't even have a shred of investigate authority. So what would be the point of having a logic battle with someone like you? Edgeworth: (Hmph...!) Kay: Why would you say something like that!? Didn't you also just get reduced to being a lone agent!? Lang: .......... Hey. Answer me this. Even though you've lost your position as a \"prosecutor\"... ...why are you sticking your neck into this case? Edgeworth: ........ (Why do I still continue to investigate...?) Agent Lang... Why are you pursuing the criminal who murdered the president? Because you're an Interpol agent? Lang: .......... Edgeworth: Right now, I am also chasing after a certain person. Someone in the shadows, who was behind the murder at the Grand Tower yesterday... Someone who placed Kay in grave danger. ...Even now, they are lurking somewhere, laughing at us. We will uncover the truth, and bring them to justice... ...and a title such as \"prosecutor\" has nothing to do with it. As long as the truth remains hidden... ...I will continue to seek out that truth. For that is a part of my creed. Lang: ........Haha! You... You're always trying to be so clever, but you really are kind of an idiot. Edgeworth: (Hmph. Me, an idiot? How rude...) Lang: That's the answer I wanted to hear. ...Alright, I'll play along with you for a bit. I've lost all my men, and you've lost your title. And yet, we still continue to investigate... Let's begin this battle of logic between two kindred spirits! Edgeworth: You have my thanks... Lang: However, I won't go easy on you. I'll definitely catch the criminal who murdered Huang. And I won't let you get in my way! Edgeworth: Yes... I wouldn't have it any other way! Lang: Let me show you the truth that this wolf has sunk his fangs into! Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower. Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president! Edgeworth: It was just the two of them alone on the rooftop... No bodyguards? Lang: Yeah. I confirmed it with those bodyguards over there. They didn't know about it either. Guess he managed to give them the slip. He must've had something secret to talk about. Edgeworth: (President Huang and Judge Gravelle... Did those two have some sort of connection?) Lang: Apparently, he had an arrangement with the owner of the Grand Tower. He requested the entrance to the viewing platform be restricted so that they could be alone. Well, it's not like the owner could turn down a request from the president. Kay: Does that mean... the last person to see the president was... Lang: Exactly... Gravelle, you mean? It's gotta be her! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang's reasoning is certainly sound... However, he has overlooked one major thing...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower. Lang: Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. Lang: At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. Lang: There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang has overlooked something major...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Edgeworth: Shi-Long Lang... For the Interpol agent with the highest arrest rate to have fallen so low. Lang: What'd you say...!? Edgeworth: This is a commemorative photo taken by the staff at Global Studios. Kay: Everyone's got such great smiles! ...Well, except for Shaun. Edgeworth: This photo was taken yesterday. Lang: What!? Edgeworth: If Judge Gravelle had murdered the president two days ago... ...then his body should have been there when this photo was taken! Lang: Owwoooooooh! Lang: Heh. Perhaps you should have listened a bit more carefully to those involved in the case. Questioning witnesses is one of the basic fundamentals of an investigation, is it not? Kay: I've captured Mr. Edgeworth's great smile! You really do look most alive when you're cornering your opponent! Lang: Grr... Just as I expected. It's been a while since I've felt like this. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, haven't you been a little hasty in your reasoning? Lang: ........Tch. I don't need your advice. Lang Zi says: \"The wrath of a wolf lasts a hundred years.\" My anger towards the woman who killed the president cannot be suppressed. Edgeworth: I, too, wish to capture the culprit. However... ...there is no doubt that the body appeared here last night. Therefore... the president could not have fallen to his death. Kay: Yeah! He was crushed by the monster head! Edgeworth: The crime occurred here at the film lot, not on the rooftop of the Grand Tower. Lang: Lang: So, that's what you think. Still, I don't intend to stray from my logic either. Edgeworth: However, he could not have fallen to his death two nights ago. This photo proves that... Lang: Is that so? Think about it this way... Two nights ago, Gravelle pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body. Edgeworth: In here? Lang: Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Once we search this area, we'll know where she hid the body. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Unfortunately, there is no need for a search. Lang: What'd you say!? Edgeworth: This piece of evidence proves that Judge Gravelle could not have hidden the body! Edgeworth: All the entrances to the film lot were locked. The chain on the back entrance was only cut last night. Lang: What!? Edgeworth: Therefore, Judge Gravelle could not have entered the film lot two nights ago! Lang: Aiyaaaaa! But the president could only have fallen two nights ago! Edgeworth: ...Why are you so insistent that the crime occurred two days ago? Lang: Why...? Because there's still more to the security camera footage. Lang: A photo was recorded 10–20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman. That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone. After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all! There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there? Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is! Edgeworth: The president never came down from the rooftop? Lang: That's right. The security camera is always watching the entrance of the elevator. It was specifically set up to record anyone who entered or exited the rooftop. Essentially, the camera created a locked room... one which the president vanished from! Edgeworth: (A locked room... I see. This is quite an unfavorable piece of evidence for Judge Gravelle...) Security Camera Photo data updated in my Organizer. Kay: A rooftop escape! That's a difficult feat! Edgeworth: So even the Yatagarasu can't just fly through the sky. Kay: That's right. I... I still need more training to be able to pull that off. Edgeworth: (Are you saying you're going to train yourself to fly?) Lang: A photo was recorded 10–20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman. Lang: That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone. Lang: After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all! Lang: There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there? Lang: Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is! Edgeworth: (A locked room created by the security camera... Is falling off the roof really the only way to escape this locked room?) Edgeworth: As a matter of fact, there was one. A hidden route... that is. Lang: A way down without using the elevator!? You'd better not tell me he flew off or something! Edgeworth: There's no need for that. It's quite simple. The president just needed to know... ...about the existence of the hidden 51st floor. Lang: The 51st floor? Edgeworth: This building has a hidden 51st floor. It is accessible through a secret hatch on the rooftop. Using that route, it would be possible to leave the rooftop without using the elevator. Lang: Lang: Hidden room? Secret hatch? How could the president have even known about that? Edgeworth: I wonder? I don't know the answer myself. I am merely raising a possibility. Lang: In the first place, what's this all about? This hidden 51st floor. Sounds like something that ninja girl over there would love to get into! Kay: No way! I'm sick of that place! Edgeworth: (For Kay, that place only holds bad memories, after all.) The 51st floor was a secret storeroom for the black market auction. Its true purpose was only exposed yesterday. Lang: ...Black market auction? You... You aren't suggesting the president was involved in something like that, are you? Edgeworth: I have no proof. However, the possibility exists, does it not? Kay: Hmm. I wouldn't put it past that president. Lang: HOOOOOOOOOOWWWL! Kay: Eek! Lang: Impossible! The president would never...! He would never be involved in a black market auction! Edgeworth: (Wh... What's this?) Lang: You punks. Are you prepared? If you're gonna spout nonsense like that... I'll tear you into pieces! Kay: Eeeeeek! Edgeworth: (...She ran away.) Lang: You don't have any idea! The amount of respect that man has earned from his country's people! Edgeworth: (I see... We have seen the president's true colors. However, the people of Zheng Fa remain in the dark... Should I inform Agent Lang of the president's true nature? No. Telling him now would only further cloud his judgment...) I understand, Agent Lang. Please calm down. We spoke out of line... I apologize. Lang: ......Sorry. My emotions got the best of me. And Kay, how long do you plan on hiding? You can come out now. Kay: ...I'm sorry. Lang: ...It's fine. My anger is directed towards the president's killer. Lotta: Well, I'll be! Yer actually a pretty good guy, ain't ya? That loyalty to yer president! It's mighty admirable! Lang: Heh. What's it to you? Lotta: Aww, don't be like that. I've got some good news for ya, I reckon. Lang: What? Lotta: The president ain't never passed through the 51st floor. Ya can count on me! Lang: Really? Lotta: I was in the storeroom myself, and I saw it with my very own eyes! Edgeworth: (That's right... She snuck into the storeroom that day.) Lotta's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer. Lang: ...Thanks. ...Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: What is it? Lang: I don't intend to give the culprit a single step of leeway. No one's seen the president since he met with Gravelle two days ago. Edgeworth: That doesn't change the fact that the body wasn't here yesterday. If he were pushed off two days ago, it would be odd that he wasn't found until yesterday. I doubt a fall from the rood would take a whole day. Lang: I'll admit, there are a few things I still haven't figured out. Edgeworth: Regardless... there is one thing I am certain of. Kay: There is? Edgeworth: What exactly occurred here last night? I'm certain we'll have to look into that in order to uncover the truth. Kay: Because the body and the hoofprints could have only appeared last night, right? Officer: Agent Lang! We'd like to bring the body in for the autopsy... Lang: Huang..... It's in your hands. Make sure you show the proper respect. Officer: I also have one more thing to report... Lang: What is it? Officer: We found some footprints near the body! Umm... They were left within the area that looks like a monster's footprint. Edgeworth: (There were human footprints within the monster's footprint?) Lang: What kind of footprints? Officer: Sir! They were the footprints of a child! About the size of an elementary school student! Edgeworth: What!? Penny: Huh!? Kay: A-An elementary school student!? Wait... Could it be...? Edgeworth: (Who... was that?) Penny: U-Umm...! Edgeworth: (Ms. Nichols?) Penny: I... I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you! Please excuse my rudeness! Edgeworth: Is there something you want to say? (What is she so scared of?) Penny: I'm worried that you'll think poorly of me, but... ...please let me testify something! It's really important! Edgeworth: (That's not something you need to be so worried about...) What is it? Penny: Last night... I... I actually came here. Lang: What!? Penny: Eek! Edgeworth: Why did you come here? Penny: ...Well, I got a little worried, so I stopped by... ...to check up on Shaun. Edgeworth: Shaun... You mean Shaun Fenn? (As I thought...) Penny: Yes. Last night, umm... Shaun stayed here late in order to practice by myself. Kay: Wow! He's really dedicated! Penny: Well, this movie is the first time he's starring as the lead role, so... ...I'm sure he wants to do his best...! Edgeworth: (She must have witnessed something last night...) When was this? Penny: Umm... If I remember correctly, I think it was a little past 10 PM. It looked like it was going to rain, and I was getting worried, so I came to check up on him. And when I got here... Well... I, umm... Lang: You... saw something? Penny: .....Y-Yes. Shaun was practicing by himself... ...and right above his head... I saw... a long... long... neck. Kay: A neck? Penny: Y-Yes! Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile... It was like... the neck of a dinosaur! Lotta: Whooooooahhh there! C-Could that've been... ...G-G-Gourdy!? Last time I went huntin' for it, it was a bust... but I reckon, this could be the real deal! Kay: What!? So this time it's Gourdy!? Penny: Th-That's right! I was really surprised! A-After all, Shaun is the boy who can communicate with Moozilla! Lotta: Yeah! That's right! Them horns of his lets him hear what the monster's sayin', right? Penny: E-Even so! He was looking up at Gourdy's face and he was talking to it! It was like they were friends! D-Doesn't that sound weird!? Lotta: You said it, sister! That's pretty darn strange, I reckon! That boy's a little traitor! Edgeworth: (...It seems she's gotten reality mixed up with the movies...) Lang: Hey, Missy... Did you really see that? Penny: Yes! But I was so shocked, I immediately ran home after that. Lang: What do you make of this, Mr. Prosecutor? Has another monster taken the stage? Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Do you really believe this absurd testimony? Lang: Hahahahaha! I couldn't care less about the monsters. However, it looks like who we need to talk to next has been decided now, hasn't it? Edgeworth: Shaun Fenn... He was here last night. It's very likely he saw something... isn't it? Lang: Atta boy! Lang: Shaun Fenn...! We've got some questions for you! ................ Penny: U-Umm... Shaun kind of left a while ago. Lang: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Kay: L-Let's go after him! Lang: Tch! Where'd he run off to!? Edgeworth: He might have just gone back home. Kay: That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today! Lang: ...Or he may have run away. Kay: A-Aren't you just overthinking things? Edgeworth: He's still a child. I can't imagine that he could have murdered the president by himself. Lang: Who said he was alone? Maybe that monster helped him. That boy can summon a monster to his aid, right? Edgeworth: Hmph. Very funny. Lang: I'm not saying that kid's definitely the culprit. But right now, he's the most prominent witness we have, So, we'll need to find that brat. Gumshoe: Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Kay: Ah! Gummy! Gumshoe: Uuugh... I, I... I...! Kay: He ran away... Edgeworth: (What is the detective doing...?) Lang: It doesn't matter... It's not like I can rely on this country's police anyways. Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. Do you intend to continue investigating by yourself? Lang: Yeah. That's right. You got a problem with that? Kay: Didn't you always have a small army of subordinates with you before? Lang: That's right... But, you know, being a lone wolf isn't all that bad. You don't have to worry about your subordinates or partners. All you need are your fangs. Simple, right? Edgeworth: (Subordinates... and partners...?) Lang: Well then. I'll be seeing you two. Lotta: He he he he. Things are gettin' interestin'! I reckon I'm about to get real busy myself! After all, I got me a pair of monsters to hunt! I'm definitely gettin' my hands on this scoop! Kay: Things have gotten pretty crazy, haven't they? Edgeworth: Indeed. There's the footprints of Moozilla, and now the shadow of Gourdy... It's almost exactly like the movie. Kay: How about we go monster hunting too? Edgeworth: Well... (Hm? Isn't that...?) Kay: Isn't that one of Lang's men...? Edgeworth: (He's one of Agent Lang's subordinates. We met him during another case.) Excuse me... MIB: Oh, Prosecutor Edgeworth. It has been a while. Kay: Shouldn't you be following Mr. Lang? MIB: Agent Lang... Shifu... is no longer my boss. Edgeworth: What exactly happened? MIB: Do you remember the incident from one month ago? Edgeworth: (The \"Yatagarasu Incident\" we had been involved with.) MIB: Agent Lang made a major mistake back then. He almost aided and abetted a dangerous criminal. Edgeworth: (Certainly... it had come quite close to that at the time.) MIB: Shifu took responsibility for what happened... and our team was disbanded. Kay: Disbanded...? Edgeworth: So that's what Agent Lang was talking about when he said he had become a lone wolf. Kay: Then... Why are you here? MIB: That's..... Well. I was a little worried about Shifu. ...It seems that even now, he's still chasing after them. The ghosts of 12 years past... Edgeworth: Ghosts of 12 years past? Just what are you... MIB: .......... I'm sorry. I've already said too much. If you'll excuse me... Edgeworth: (These ghosts Agent Lang is chasing after... Do they also have something to do with this case?) Kay: Looks like everyone's left now... So, what do we do now? Edgeworth: Well... Ms. Hart is going after the monsters, and Agent Lang is going after Shaun. We should also try approaching this case from a different angle. Kay: What angle would that be? Edgeworth: ...We should listen to what Judge Gravelle has to say. Kay: Ah! That's right! If I'm not mistaken, Ms. Gravelle is... Gravelle: ...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Fifi Laguarde's trial. Kay: She said that she had a trial coming up! Edgeworth: Indeed. Let's head to the courthouse as well. Kay: 'Kay! To be continued. Gravelle: Court is now in session. Is the defense ready? Ray: Of course, Your Honor! We can begin whenever you want. Franziska: The prosecution has been ready from the start, Your Honor. Edgeworth: Jill Crane, the attorney in charge of the defense, has passed on from this world. Furthermore, Sebastian Debeste, the prosecutor-in-charge, has disappeared... And so, Franziska and Mr. Shields have taken over their duties. Gravelle: Before we begin, I would like to apologize for the delay of today's trial. As the crime took place in the prison, a place where justice is normally administered... ...and the defendant was the warden of the prison, further exacerbating the situation... ...additional time was specially arranged to investigate and prepare for the trial. In addition, the defense attorney in charge of the case, Jill Crane, has recently passed away... Due to these circumstances, the trial was further delayed. Mr. Shields, Ms. von Karma. At this time, I'd like to give you my gratitude for taking up this responsibility on short notice. Ray: I guess this is the last job Gravelle-pie's friend left behind for us, huh? Well, Uncle Ray's more than happy to help out. Although having said that, I only had enough time to skim through the case files... Are you OK on your end, Franny-pie? Franziska: What kind of prosecutor abandons his own case and vanishes without a trace...!? I won't allow any more delays in this trial while we wait for that foolish man to return. I have received the evidence just now. There should be no problem continuing the trial. Gravelle: ...You have my thanks. And with that, I hereby call the defendant, Fifi Laguarde, to the stand. Laguarde: ........ Gravelle: Now then, will the prosecution please give us their opening statement? Franziska: Very well, Your Honor. The defendant... Laguarde: ...Please wait, Your Honor. Gravelle: What is it? Laguarde: Well, there's something I'd like you to fill me in on. Just what exactly... am I doing in a place like this? Gravelle: Then perhaps... you would do well to listen to the opening statement. Laguarde: Hmm. So if I listen to it, I'll get it, huh? OK then, let's hear it. Franziska: ...That was the plan from the start. Now, if you would kindly shut up and listen. The incident occurred in the detention center and the prison Warden Laguarde is in charge of. The victim is Horace Knightley, who was being held in the detention center. The prosecution is certain that this woman here is the culprit. This knife, the murder weapon, is the decisive evi..... Huh!? Gravelle: Ms. von Karma. Is something wrong? Franziska: Th-That's... impossible! The evidence is...! Ray: What's wrong with the evidence, Franny-pie? Franziska: The evidence... the knife's gone! The chisel with Kanis's bell attached to it is missing too! Ray: Wh... Whaaat!? Gravelle: Order! Order! Prosecutor von Karma. What is the meaning of this? Franziska: I... I don't understand it either, Your Honor. Laguarde: If there's no evidence, then I suppose there's not much reason for me to be here. Some prosecutor. Can't even hold on to one little piece of evidence. What a dunce. Franziska: I... I only received everything that the previous prosecutor had... Ah! Ray: ...It appears the culprit is that pampered prosecutor, the Boy Blunder. Hey, Gravelle-pie. Gravelle: What is it? Ray: Your Honor! Considering our predicament, what say we postpone the trial until later? Gravelle: Gravelle: The defense's proposal is overruled. Ray: Eh? Gravelle-pie...? Laguarde: I know, right? It'd be troubling for me if this trial were to be delayed any further. I just want everyone to know that I'm innocent. As soon as possible. Franziska: Franziska: Innocent!? I've had more than enough of your foolish... Laguarde: And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... \"In court, evidence is everything.\" Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor? Gravelle: .......... That is correct. Franziska: Eh! Ray: What!? Gravelle: The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Fifi Laguarde... Ray: Ray: Hold your horses, Gravelle-pie! You can't just declare her innocent all of a sudden! Gravelle: Is something the matter? For the defense to object to a \"not guilty\" verdict... Ray: Well, I mean... Even you must know that the warden over there is guilty, right? You were there with us when we found the murder weapon! Gravelle: ........ Mr. Shields. A judge must remain impartial when handing down a verdict. That is why I cannot allow myself to get caught up in my own personal feelings... The person who was present when the murder weapon was discovered... ...and the judge sitting before you now, are two completely different people. Ray: ...You're kidding, right? Gravelle: I can only hand down a verdict based upon the evidence that was presented. Franziska: Franziska: There is evidence! It's just... Well, it's not here right now, but... A few minutes, that's all I need! I'll find the evidence and return to court, without fail! The prosecution requests a brief recess, Your Honor! Gravelle: ........ Ray: Th-The defense would also like a recess, Your Honor. Gravelle-pie. Please... Gravelle: ........ ...I understand. I shall grant your request. Laguarde: Well! Verity-darling! Aren't you wishy-washy today? Gravelle: This court will now adjourn for a 15 minute recess! During with, the prosecution and the defense shall prepare for the resumption of the trial. Franziska: ...Understood, Your Honor. Ray: Phew. That was a close one. Gravelle: Court is now adjourned! Kay: Didn't we find it together!? The evidence! Edgeworth: Yes, we certainly did. Gumshoe: Huh? Edgeworth: What's the matter, Detective? Gumshoe: It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator. Kay: Really! Why? Edgeworth: (Of course, that's why the metal detector reacted!) Judge Gravelle, I'd like you to take a look at this. Gravelle: The chisel...? Debeste: Wasn't that just the fake murder weapon? Edgeworth: Kanis hid this chisel inside this dog's mouth. And the real murder weapon was hidden in very much the same way... Laguarde: ...! Edgeworth: The real murder weapon is in the pond, inside the alligator! Edgeworth: I wonder if it was stolen by someone... ???: Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Ms. Berry and Mr. Saint. Did you come to attend the trial? Regina: I came because I heard there's a really fun show around here! So, where is it? Simeon: The trial for the case I got caught up in was supposed to have already started, but... ..our practice ran a little late. I believe it was somewhere around here, wasn't it? Kay: Actually, two key pieces of evidence have gone missing: the chisel and the knife... The trial is in recess now. Sort of like an intermission. You just missed it, Simeon. Simeon: Wha... Whaaaaaat!? Wh-wh-wh-what's that supposed to mean!? Regina: Ah ha ha! Looks like Simeon's going to get arrested again! Simeon: Eeeeeeeeeek! Nowaynowaynoway, I can't...! Kay: Hmm. I guess Simeon is his usual noisy self. ...Huh? ???: To think that I would be humiliated like this! Edgeworth: ...And here comes another noisy individual. Ray: Now, now, Franny-pie. Let's just take a moment and calm down a bit. Maybe you could put that whip of yours away, him? Whaddaya say? Franziska: That foolish prosecutor! When I get my hands on him... ...my whip is going to give him the thrashing of a lifetime! Ray: Eek! Miles, why don't you try talking to her? Edgeworth: (Good grief... On that note, I guess I should probably hear what she has to say.) (Clearing all \"Talk\" options of Franziska and Ray leads to:) Ray: If only there were someone who could go search for the evidence for us... ........ Edgeworth: ........ .....Very well. I'll go look for them. Ray: Oh! Miles! You'd do that for us? Edgeworth: Of course, finding the evidence within fifteen minutes will be no easy task. Ray: Well, if worse comes to worst, Uncle Ray and Franny-pie will help you stall for time. Franziska: .......... Ray: Until you recover the evidence, we won't let her hand down a verdict. Edgeworth: Please do so. ...Franziska, are you OK with this? Franziska: .....You're asking me, Franziska von Karma, to help you out? You'd be better off spending the rest of your life as an anchorman for the local news... Ray: Ms. von Karma. This is an emergency. We could really use your cooperation. Franziska: ! Hmph... I understand. As acting prosecutor, I, along with that attorney over there, shall continue this trial. Meanwhile, you, the \"former\" prosecutor shall run around and look for the evidence... ...all for my sake. It's a job that suits you perfectly! Edgeworth: ...I'm glad that you're on board. Simeon: I-I'll help out too! ...'Cause I really don't wanna get arrested again. Regina: This sounds like fun! Regina wants to tag along too! Edgeworth: Alright. That would be helpful. Now then, where should we begin? Kay: I think we should go find that person, and hear what they have to say! Edgeworth: Who should we talk to in order to learn where the evidence went? Edgeworth: Yes. The person in charge of the evidence was Sebastian Debeste. Simeon: Ah, you mean that rookie prosecutor, right? Got it! Edgeworth: I'll leave him to you. Ray: Alright. Time for Uncle Ray to have a strategy meeting with the opposing counsel. ...Just the two of uUUAAAGH! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... You better not keep me waiting. Lest you end up like your friend here. Edgeworth: Yes.... I'll keep that in mind. Ray: Franny-pie, wait for meeeee! Edgeworth: Now then, let's go help look for Sebastian as well. Kay: Ah! Edgeworth: (Judge Gravelle...) Gravelle: ...If it isn't Prosecutor Edgeworth. I hope that all is well. Kay: All is NOT well! Just what was going on in that trial earlier...? Edgeworth: Kay! There's no need for that. Kay: But...! Even though Ms. Gravelle should know exactly who the culprit is... What made you...? Gravelle: ........ In a court of law, the only thing that truly matters is evidence... Whatever my own feelings may be, it should not affect the verdict. Edgeworth: So, is this the \"Judge persona\" of Verity Gravelle we're seeing? Gravelle: Cold-blooded and heartless... It's fine if you think of me as such. Edgeworth: (Even as a judge, she's still this stubborn?) Judge Gravelle. There's just... one thing I'd like to ask you. Gravelle: And what would that be? Edgeworth: Two nights ago... you went to the roof of the Grand Tower. Gravelle: ! The roof... you say? Edgeworth: You met with the president there, correct? The two of you were caught on the security camera. Gravelle: Is there some sort of problem with that? Edgeworth: Today... The president's body was discovered. Very close to the Grand Tower. Gravelle: Th-That's...! Edgeworth: You understand now, don't you? You're a suspect. ...What happened between you and the president up on the roof? Gravelle: Nothing... We merely spoke for a few minutes. Once our business was done, I headed straight home. I took the elevator back down alone. Edgeworth: Indeed. That was shown on the security camera footage as well. What exactly did you and the president talk about? Gravelle: Th-That... I cannot say. Edgeworth: (I see. However, I cannot afford to let up just yet. That being the case... Heh. I guess my only remaining options is to use that. She is definitely hiding something...! And I'm going to draw it out of her!) Edgeworth: Two nights ago, Judge Gravelle met with President Huang... Gravelle: ........ Gravelle: ...It is true that I spoke with President Huang on the roof of the Grand Tower. However, we only discussed business. There is no need to tell you what was said. Edgeworth: Hmm... Just like in the trial earlier, she won't reveal her personal feelings easily. When she's speaking as a judge, it would be better for me to wait and see what develops. Now then, I'll start by asking her what she talked about with the president! Edgeworth: Could you tell me... what you and the president talked about? Gravelle: My meeting with the president was strictly business. And since it has nothing to do with you, I am not obligated to answer your question. Edgeworth: ...... Gravelle: I appreciate your understanding. Edgeworth: Even so... You certainly are a very busy person, aren't you? You're a member of the P.I.C. and a judge as well. You even assist with the investigations. Gravelle: I am simply fulfilling the professional duties that have been assigned to me. Edgeworth: Was your meeting with the president also one of the duties assigned to you as a judge? Gravelle: .....Yes. Of course it was. I... am one who lives for the law. I would never act outside my professional duties. Edgeworth: This morning, you returned Kay's \"promise notebook\" to me. I don't believe that all of yours actions are simply done for the sake of your duties. Gravelle: .....It's true, it seems I still retain some immature qualities. Edgeworth: I wouldn't call it immature. It was your own personal kindness. Weren't you also distressed when you found out the president had passed away? Gravelle: Yes... It is very unfortunate... Why did he have to die...? Edgeworth: It seems he was crushed by the head of a monster called the \"Mighty Moozilla\". Ah... Excuse me. You see, Moozilla is... Gravelle: I-Is that true!? You mean... the president died at the temporary Moozilla film lot...? Edgeworth: Yes. That's right... I'm surprised that you know about Moozilla. Gravelle: Y-Yes... I had heard about it from Sebastian. He told me that the movie was being filmed near the Grand Tower... Edgeworth: ...She seems awfully shaken up about that. And I'm also curious about Sebastian, who went missing along with the evidence. She said she wouldn't talk about the president... However, I might be able to get her to reveal her secret through another line of questioning. She is flustered beyond normal. There must be some reason behind it! Edgeworth: Franziska may have taken over the prosecution in Sebastian's place, however... ...as long as he still possesses some of the evidence, the trial cannot proceed. Gravelle: I intend to carry out a fair trial. If the prosecution is unable to present evidence... the defendant must be declared not guilty. Edgeworth: ...... Gravelle: I am a judge. I cannot allow my own personal feelings to get in the way. Edgeworth: So, you're saying you're not the least bit worried about Sebastian's whereabouts? Gravelle: Of course... I am... I am worried about Sebastian, as well, but... Edgeworth: You're worried about Sebastian \"as well\"? Wouldn't that mean... ...that there is someone else you're worried about? Gravelle: Ah...! Edgeworth: By any chance... would that person have something to do with your unnatural behavior? Gravelle: ...That's impossible. I... ...I am a follower of the law... I will not... be swayed by... personal feelings. Edgeworth: It may be true that those who stand in court have a duty to follow the law. However, we're not superheroes! You and I are only human. It is impossible to completely ignore your own feelings and render an impartial judgement! Gravelle: Aaaaaaah! .....It is as you say. As I am now... I cannot hand down an impartial verdict. Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Why don't you tell me the truth? Gravelle: I... I...! Just what am I supposed to do...!? Edgeworth: For Judge Gravelle to become this distraught... I should find out exactly who she is searching for. Up until now, she has been wearing the mask of a judge... This time, I should be able to draw out her true feelings! Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: Earlier, when Moozilla was brought up, it seemed to be a sensitive topic for you... Is that \"child\" you spoke of involved with the Moozilla movie? Gravelle: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! H-How!? How do you know that...!? Edgeworth: You're usually so calm, yet you seem rather distraught right now. Please, tell me... Who is that child!? Gravelle: ...I understand. If you've come to know this much... I shall prepare myself for the worst. The child I'm searching for... is a boy by the name of Shaun Fenn. Edgeworth: Shaun...? Why do you want to know his whereabouts? Gravelle: Well... That much, I simply cannot say... Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Didn't you say you were prepared for the worst!? Gravelle: .....! Edgeworth: Even if you don't intend to talk, I am determined to expose the truth. ...That is my resolve. Why is she searching for Shaun... I must get her to tell me the reason. Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: I don't know what kind of relationship you have with Shaun... ...but at the very least, the two of you must be acquaintances! Gravelle: E... Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Won't you allow us to help you in your search for him? Gravelle: Help...? No, that won't be allowed? Edgeworth: Who won't allow it? The so-called Goddess of Law? Gravelle: ...The person who knows where that child is.. Edgeworth: I see... Finally, I've connected all the pieces of the puzzle. The reason why you cannot easily talk about Shaun... It was because... Someone kidnapped him, isn't that right? Gravelle: A-Aah... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: ...Judge Gravelle. I would like to hear the truth from your own lips. Gravelle: .....I understand. This time... I will truly be prepared for the worst. It is just as you deduced... Someone has kidnapped Shaun. Edgeworth: ! As I thought... There was a kidnapping! Still, how is Shaun's kidnapping related to you in any way? Gravelle: ......Shaun and I are... ...mother and child... Edgeworth: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? I was unable to learn much about the conversation she had with the president, but... ...I have learned of Shaun's kidnapping. ...It was an unexpected result, but with that... it's checkmate. Gravelle: ....... Kay: Whaaat!? J-Shaun is... Ms. Gravelle's son!? No way! I mean, he's already so big, for him to be your... Gravelle: Yes... Shaun is indeed my son. Please look at this... Edgeworth: (This is a clipping from a magazine...) Kay: It's an article about Shaun! Do you always carry this around with you? Gravelle: Yes. I always keep it close by. It's like a charm to me... Edgeworth: (It seems the bond that they share is a strong one.) Gravelle: ....... Edgeworth: However, are you absolutely certain that he's been kidnapped? Gravelle: Yes. I received a call from the kidnapper just before the trial started... Edgeworth: What were their demands? Gravelle: They had only one demand. A \"Not Guilty\" verdict for Fifi Laguarde... Edgeworth: (I see. So that's what happened...) Laguarde: And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... \"In court, evidence is everything.\" Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor? Gravelle: .......... That is correct. The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Fifi Laguarde... Edgeworth: So, that's why you were going to deliver a \"Not Guilty\" verdict earlier? Gravelle: I am... not qualified to be a judge... A judge must be able to remain impartial and composed, above all else. And yet... despite this, in the trial just now, I... ...I was about to hand down a verdict that was led solely by my heart! Edgeworth: .....Judge Gravelle. Gravelle: The Goddess of Law must be furious with me... ...but, I simply couldn't do it. I couldn't hand down a fair verdict... if it meant I had to sacrifice my own son! Kay: Of course you can't! Edgeworth: (Kay...) Kay: A real parent... would never abandon their own child! If that makes the Goddess of Law angry, then maybe the Goddess is the one who's wrong! The Goddess is guilty! Guilty! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Indeed. (To declare a goddess guilty...) We're responsible for upholding the law, but at the same time, we are only human. Nobody would hand down a verdict that would sacrifice their own child. Gravelle: .....Thank you very much. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth. However... I cannot simply run away from the courtroom. Bailiff: Judge Gravelle! So this is where you've been. Gravelle: It appears it's time... Kay: .......... Ms. Gravelle! ...My father, he was a prosecutor. Gravelle: Your father...? Kay: Yes. He stood in court, just like you. ...And now, with all that has happened, it got me thinking... What if, my father had been in the same position as you are now? Gravelle: If a prosecutor was being coerced into obtaining a guilty verdict... Kay: I know... if my life were on the line, my father... ...would definitely come to steal me back! Gravelle: Steal you... back? Kay: Ms. Gravelle. Why don't you let us take care of it? Gravelle: What...? Kay: I'm gonna go steal Shaun back for you! As the second Yatagarasu, I, Kay Faraday, give you my word! Gravelle: ...... Edgeworth: (Heh. So, the Great Thief Yatagarasu plans to steal the \"truth\", huh...) What say you, Judge Gravelle? Will you place your trust in our young Great Thief? Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth... Edgeworth: And, if it's alright with you, I wish to help as well. Gravelle: .....Thank you very much. I know that it's really not my place to ask this of you... ...but please... do whatever you can... Please save Shaun. Kay: You got it! Just leave everything to us! Gravelle: Allow me to leave my cellphone with you. You may get a call from the kidnapper at some point. Edgeworth: You have my word. I will ensure the safe return of your phone, alone with your son. Gravelle: And I will do everything in my power to prolong the trial. But... even then, at most the trial can only last for about two more hours... Edgeworth: (Two hours, huh... So, until 2 PM. That's our time frame...) Gravelle: ...I must return to court. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall leave the rest to you. Edgeworth: Heh. Kay, I thought you were taking a break from being the Great Thief? Kay: As of right now, the Great Thief Yatagarasu is back in business! Alright! Time to put on the gloves and hit the pavement! It's my first request, after all! Edgeworth: Is that so? In that case, we'd better begin our investigation posthaste... ...if we hope to track down Shaun... Lang: Tch! Where'd he run off to!? Edgeworth: He might have just gone back home. Kay: That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today! Lang: ...Or he may have run away. Edgeworth: We should probably begin our investigation from the front of the Grand Tower. Kay: H-Hey! Hold it, Mr. Edgeworth! You're not the one in charge anymore! From here on out, this is a job for a Great Thief! Which means, I'm the leader now! Edgeworth: ...If that's the case, then what am I supposed to do? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, you get to be... the first ever Great Thief's Assistant! Edgeworth: (So, I'm a thief's assistant now...?) Kay: Alright! Let's get going! The Great Thief Yatagarasu takes flight once again! Kay: Here we are! The scene of the crime! Let's get to work! Now, say it with me, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hm? Say what? Kay: \"Even in the depths of night...\" Edgeworth: .......... Kay: Aww, come on! Say the rest with me! Edgeworth: And just why should I do that!? Kay: Because! The Great Thief Yatagarasu has arrived on the scene! If we don't say the introduction, it just doesn't feel right! Edgeworth: I have no intention of becoming a thief. Kay: Aargh! Fine, then. I'll do it by myself! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: Yes, Kay. I know you are. I, on the other hand, am starting the investigation. Kay: Tch. You're no fun. Edgeworth: ...We don't have time for \"fun\". We only have until 2 o'clock. We need to begin making inquiries immediately. Kay: Good thing we have a photo, so we can go right ahead and start asking around! (Examining trailer after clearing all \"Talk\" options of Powers, blue truck, taxi, and film equipment and talking with officer leads to:) Edgeworth: (Hmm. It's already half past 12...) Kay: I wonder how Ms. Gravelle and the others are holding up... Edgeworth: How long will they be able to prolong the trial...? Kay: We gotta hurry and find Shaun! Edgeworth: Indeed. Lotta: Aww heck naw! That ain't how it's done! Ya ain't gonna catch a scoop like that! Nicole: S-Sorry, Chief! Lotta: What am I always tellin' ya!? We're beasts! Scoop-eatin' animals! It's scoop or starve! No story, no glory! Ya gotta get fired up! Nicole: Yessir! As expected of my mentor! Edgeworth: They're here... (It's those noisy reporters.) Kay: Hey, they came here too! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go talk to them! Edgeworth: ...Good grief. If we must. Edgeworth: What if the kidnappers stole the box? Kay: Ah! You mean they...! Edgeworth: Exactly. They took it in order to carry Shaun inside it. Kay: Shaun's a tiny kid, after all. Then, the reason the taxi driver didn't see Shaun was because... Edgeworth: It's likely he was put in the trunk as the kidnapper's luggage. Kay: But, why did they need to go through all the trouble of hiding him? Edgeworth: At first, the kidnappers must have intended to abduct him without being seen. However, they didn't anticipate all the policemen in the plaza. Kay: Ah, I see. If they tried to just walk away with him, they would've been spotted... Edgeworth: Just the mere presence of policemen would have been a sizable threat. Kay: I geddit! In that case, we've gotta ask the taxi driver! Edgeworth: Did the two men you told us about earlier have any luggage with them? Driver: Yeah. They stuffed a huge box into the trunk. Kay: Then that's that! Those guys must be the kidnappers! Edgeworth: Do you remember where you took those men? Driver: Sounds to me like something serious has gone down here... If you'd like, I could take you to the same place I took them. Kay: Let's do it, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes. Thank you for your help. Driver: No problemo! Just leave it to me! Kay: Uugh... That taxi drove way too fast. I don't feel too good. Edgeworth: ........ Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, are you alright? Your face is really pale. Edgeworth: I-I'm fine. The driver said they came to this house's garage... Kay: This must be where those two men brought the box! ...Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Look at the nameplate on the door! Edgeworth: Nameplate...? What!? \"Blaise Debeste\"!? Kay: So this is... the chairman's house! Edgeworth: (Does that mean the one who kidnapped Shaun was Blaise Debeste? Blaise should have already been arrested though...) Kay: Ah! The garage door is unlocked! Edgeworth: You really do have a good eye for this sort of thing... Edgeworth: (It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.) Kay: Excuse me... we're coming in... Anybody home? Edgeworth: Doing something like this, it's as if we're a couple of petty thieves...! Kay: Shh! Be quiet! Right now, we're Great Thieves! Have some self-awareness! Edgeworth: (...She scolded me.) Nobody's here... For now, it looks like we can get through this without being arrested. Kay: This isn't the time to be relieved! Now the real deal begins! Let's go look for treasure! Edgeworth: (We are looking for Shaun, not treasure...) (Examining the \"Cement bag\", \"Shovel and sledgehammer\", \"Gloves\" and \"Green box\" leads to:) ???: ...*thump, thump*... Edgeworth: Hm? Kay: Th-There's someone inside! ???: ...*thump, thump*... *thump, thump*... *CRASH*! Edgeworth: Is it... Shaun...? Kay: Shaun! We're coming to save you! ......Eh? Edgeworth: (Th-This is...!) You're..... S-Sebastian! Kay: Whaaaaat!? Why!? Debeste: Nnnnf, Nmmnnnmmf! Kay: This is Blaise's house, right? That would mean... Edgeworth: Yes. It should also be Sebastian's house. (So then, why is he...?) Kay, go help him out. Kay: If it has to do with ropes, just leave it to Kay! Here I go! A little pull over here, and a quick tug over there! Are you alright, Sebastian? Debeste: .......... Edgeworth: (He looks a little worse for wear.) Why were you tied up in a place like this? Debeste: .....How should I know!? Y-You guys don't know anything about me! Edgeworth: .....It's because we don't know. That's why we're asking you... Debeste: .......... Kay: He's completely shut off his heart... Edgeworth: Indeed... If it's come to this... ...I suppose I have no choice but to use that. Kay: Ah! You mean! Edgeworth: I hate to do this when he's in such a fragile state. It's like kicking a man who's down... Kay: ...Will it be alright? His mind might break if you corner him too much, y'know? Edgeworth: Yes. I am aware of that. I will try to be careful. (Good grief. I wonder how this will turn out... I've never held back against anyone before...) Edgeworth: After running out of the meeting room this morning, why would he be here of all places...? Debeste: You guys... You don't know how I feel! Edgeworth: (He's gone through a lot of shock. He must be on the verge of an emotional meltdown.) It can't be helped... At times like this, I must quietly listen to what he has to say. Debeste: N-No one tells me anything... I'm always the only one being left out like an idiot...! Edgeworth: (Hmm... I should try to answer his questions as best as I can.) Considering how fragile he is... I won't have much time to spare. I'll need to ask about his true feelings, and try to calm him down posthaste! Edgeworth: Could you please tell me what's on your mind? Debeste: I... I don't wanna! It's not like you'd listen to me anyways! Edgeworth: ..... Debeste: Wh-What's wrong? Normally, you'd be shouting \"Objection!\" right about now! Edgeworth: ..... Debeste: ...You're serious? Y-You're really... gonna listen to what I have to say? Edgeworth: I can understand... the shock you went through after what happened with your father. Debeste: It wasn't just Pops. This morning, I... I lost everything! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: E-Everything I have... was given to me by Pops... T-Tell me, Mr. Edgeworth... Just what am I supposed to believe in...? Edgeworth: If you can't believe in others, then at least believe in yourself. You'll need to gain experience on your own, but if you require wisdom, I can lend you a hand. Debeste: ! ...Ever since I got locked up, I've been thinking... ...am I too inculpable to be a prosecutor... uh? Incapable...? Erm, which one was it? Edgeworth: I believe \"incapable\" is the word you are looking for. Judging your own ability is not an easy task. Sebastian. Little by little, you are growing. Debeste: ! Edgeworth: Sebastian. Would you tell me your side of the story? Debeste: .....I-I understand. What... should I talk about? Edgeworth: Hmm. He seems to have calmed down slightly. I'd like you to tell me everything you know about the kidnappers. Now then... Tell me what you heard and saw! Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: Kidnapping his own son in order to demand a ransom wouldn't make such sense. Debeste: .....Y-Yeah, you're right! Edgeworth: Did you notice anything strange when you got kidnapped? Debeste: Oooh... As soon as I answered their question, they just took me away... Edgeworth: They asked you a question...? Tell me what they asked you! Debeste: Waaah! D-Don't glare at me like that... Erm... I think they asked me, \"Do you know Gravelle?\" Edgeworth: ! I see.. The pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall into place. Blaise... and the kidnappers did not intend to kidnap you. Their objective was Shaun Fenn. They were planning to kidnap Judge Gravelle's son... ...in order to have Fifi Laguarde declared not guilty! Debeste: J-Verity has a son...? And Warden Laguarde gets declared not guilty...? Edgeworth: I suspect... the kidnappers mistook you for Shaun Fenn. Debeste: A-All of this... was just a mistake? ! Wait... maybe that's why, back then...! Edgeworth: Hm...? Did you just remember something? Debeste: N-No..... It's nothing! I'm useless anyways... Just... leave me alone already! Edgeworth: Th-This is bad! He might be at his emotional limit...! I must get him to tell me what he remembered, and try to calm him down as well. Based on how distressed Sebastian looks right now... ...it must have been quite traumatic. I'll need to help him get back on his feet! Edgeworth: What did you remember just now? Debeste: I-I didn't remember anything... about Po... that guy... Edgeworth: Would \"that guy\" happen to be Blaise? Debeste: D-Darniiiiiit! Oooh... So this is the difference between me and someone who earned his Prosecutor title... Edgeworth: ...I've been waiting to ask you: Why did you become a prosecutor? Debeste: What does it matter!? I'm not fit to be a prosecutor anyways! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: S-Say something! Edgeworth: You must have some reason for choosing this path, right? Debeste: ...N-No, it's not like that! It wasn't anything special! I became a prosecutor for a really insignificant reason! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: It was just... a personal reason. Edgeworth: Heh... Just like you, I, too, became a prosecutor for a personal reason. Debeste: Huh...? I-Is that true...? B-But... you're a really successful prosecutor... I'm sure that Pops... the P.I.C. chairman... would have been more proud of you than me. Edgeworth: I see... so, you wanted your father's approval. Debeste: Ooh.....! I thought that if I became the best prosecutor, he'd be proud of me! That's why I...! I just wanted to help out Pops as much as I could......! Edgeworth: Would you... happen to be protecting your father? Debeste: Wha... I-I don't have any reason to protect someone like him...! Edgeworth: Didn't you want to help out your father... as much as you could? Debeste: Uuuuuunngh... Just once... I only wanted to be useful to Pops just this once! That way... I could help him regain his repetition! Edgeworth: You seem to be mixing up your words again... The word you're looking for is \"reputation\". Debeste: Huh? N-No one's ever told me that before! Edgeworth: Your father, who has strayed from his path, continues to add to his crimes... Even knowing that, do you truly want things to stay the way they are? Debeste: But... in that case, just what am I supposed to do? Edgeworth: You should triumph over your father, who has treated you like a fool. You must stop Blaise before he commits another crime! Debeste: ! I never thought of it that way. I... I want to triumph over Pops! Edgeworth: ...Somehow, it seems he has calmed down once again. Now's my chance to ask him about Blaise's secret! I will give Sebastian the courage to stand up to his father! Edgeworth: Hmm... He seems to have become unsettled again. I suppose I should lend him a hand... Edgeworth: The place you thought would be the safest... Would that have been in Blaise Debeste's hands? Debeste: Ungh... Waaaaaahhh! H-He told me that it would be safer if he took care of the evidence! Edgeworth: I'm sorry... but he has betrayed your trust in the worst way possible. Debeste: Pops... why would he want to hide the evidence...? Edgeworth: Blaise's objective was to have Warden Laguarde found not guilty, by obscuring the truth... Sebastian. You... were used by your father! Debeste: Ungh... Uwaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: It's possible that Blaise Debeste has the evidence with him. Furthermore, we still have no idea where Shaun is. I must return to my investigation posthaste, however... Debeste: This... This is all my fault...! What am I gonna do now...!? Edgeworth: ...Seeing him like this, I can't just leave him be. He is still suffering in the gap between his ideal and reality. He will never move on until he figures out how to live his own life! Sebastian is about to face his greatest trial. Perhaps this is fate. I shall give him the push forward that he needs. Edgeworth: For goodness' sake... Don't you remember your own words? Perhaps his \"own will\" can show him the way. Edgeworth: As a prosecutor... didn't you want to walk a different path from your father? Certainly, the path you have chosen is not an easy one. Nevertheless, you still chose to live as a prosecutor. In that case, it should be clear to you what you need to do...! Debeste: ! Edgeworth: ...I still question how I live my life to this day. But you, Sebastian... have found your own answer. So believe in yourself, Prosecutor Debeste! Debeste: I... WAAAAAAAAAAH! Edgeworth: (He was mistaken for Shaun, and kidnapped by Blaise's underlings. And after his father stole his evidence, he lost his confidence as a prosecutor... The emotions he is going through must be more painful than anything I could imagine.) It's taken longer than I thought... but with that, it's checkmate. Debeste: U-unh, uugh... ungh...! D... D-D-D-D... DARN IIIIIIIIIIIT! Edgeworth: .......... Kay: H-He dashed out of here at full speed... Edgeworth: (It seems if there's one thing he's \"the best\" at, it's running away...) Edgeworth: (Curses! We're running out of time...) We should check in with Mr. Shields. (I'd also like to know what the situation is like on their end.) Kay: But Mr. Debeste ran off again... Edgeworth: We'll just give them the new information we discovered. Franziska will take his place. Kay: Hmm... I wonder if that's going to be enough... Edgeworth: It can't be helped. Since he ran away, there's nothing more we can do. District Court - Courtroom No. 3 Ray: Eerm. I guess I'll just say it again. If there's no murder weapon, you can't prove the defendant is guilty. Franziska: Franziska: Just because we don't have the murder weapon, doesn't mean the defendant is innocent! It seems you wish to taste the sting of my whip. Ray: Gyaaah! Laguarde: Mr. Attorney. This trial... How much longer will it take? Because it feels like it hasn't gone anywhere at all for a good while now! Ray: Well, sorry, but that stubborn prosecutor over there just doesn't seem to understand. Franziska: Until I am satisfied... ...this whip will lash out at you as many times as I see fit. Ray: (By now, she's probably whipped me once for every year I've been alive... Miles... What's taking you so long? Even though we're just stalling for time, Uncle Ray can't keep this up much longer!) Whoops, 'scuse me. Phone call. Mind if I take this? Gravelle: ...I will allow it. Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. Ray: Oh, Miles, it's you. How's it going over there? Edgeworth: We found Sebastian. Ray: Oh! And the knife and chisel? Edgeworth: It seems he handed the evidence over to Blaise Debeste. It's very likely that Blaise knows the whereabouts of the murder weapon. Ray: Ex-chairman Debeste!? But, why would Blaise...? Edgeworth: That, I don't know yet. However, there may be some hidden connection between... ...Fifi Laguarde and Blaise. Ray: Gotcha. In that case, I'll issue a subpoena for Blaise Debeste right away. Edgeworth: ! Ray: I'll grill him personally. Edgeworth: I will continue to search for the missing evidence. (And for Shaun, as well...) Ray: Try to hurry it up, would ya? We're at our wits end over here! It feels like the verdict could be handed down at any moment! Edgeworth: Understood. (How much longer can Judge Gravelle's heart hold out? I know she's in a lot of pain... I've got to hurry.) Outside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza Kay: So? How's the trial going? Edgeworth: Blaise will be taking the stand. I don't know how things will turn out, though. Kay: He'll do anything, from hiding evidence to kidnapping... He really is nothing but trouble. Edgeworth: I agree. We should probably take another look at the evidence concerning him. Kay: OK! Leave it to me! First, here's the latest evidence fresh from the scene! Edgeworth: They're... the gloves from earlier. Although I am certainly curious about them... Anything else? Kay: The case files from the IS-7 Incident. If I recall, Blaise was also involved in this, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. He was involved in destroying the evidence. For now, let's keep this on hand. IS-7 Incident Documents jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Now then... is there anything else? Kay: Of course! Last but not least... We've got this! Edgeworth: This is... the Yatagarasu's badge. ...Kay. I'm talking about things related to Blaise. Please be serious. Kay: But aren't you always going around presenting random evidence too, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Gah...! No... W-Well... That's... Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?) Kay: Ah! What're you doing here? Debeste: WHOOOOOOOAAAHH! Kay: H-He ignored us... Edgeworth: (He came out of the Grand Tower... What was he doing in there?) Kay: Let's go investigate what Mr. Debeste was up to! Edgeworth: Yes... Let us go. Grand Tower - Rooftop Edgeworth: Hm? (The hatch is open...) Kay: It might be Mr. Debeste who opened it! Grand Tower - 51st Floor Storeroom Edgeworth: (Did Sebastian come in here...?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Over there! The safe's open! Edgeworth: (Did he come here to open that? ...Let's examine it thoroughly.) Kay: There's something inside the safe! Edgeworth: Let's go ahead and have a look. There are some documents in here... Kay: Hmm... it's just a bunch of papers and... huh? There's a photo here too. Edgeworth: Hm? This is a picture of...! Kay: Huh!? Th-That's Mr. Knightley! Knightley: ...Horace Knightley. The president's bodyguard. Kay: Why is his picture here? And what are all of these papers for!? Edgeworth: I don't know... We will have to read the documents to find out. I'm all but certain there is a connection between Knightley and Kanis. Kanis's chess partner, whose identity remained unknown until now... ...was actually Knightley all along. That is proof enough. Tomorrow, I shall interrogate him in the warden's office. I'll get him to confess that he's one of Kanis's henchmen. That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago... ...you simply must retrieve it. Edgeworth: This... seems to be a report about Knightley. Kay: Not to mention, it was apparently written before Knightley was killed...! Edgeworth: (Horace Knightley was murdered while he was being interrogated in the warden's office...) Judging from the contents, this document was probably written by Fifi Laguarde. Kay: I knew it! Edgeworth: The question, however, is who this report was addressed to. Kay: Ah! The owner of this safe is...! Edgeworth: The Conductor... Blaise Debeste. Kay: So, this proves that Ms. Laguarde and Blaise are connected! Edgeworth: Indeed. However, it's not just the two of them. Kay: Huh? Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste and Fifi Laguarde were searching for Kanis's henchmen. Kay: Bodhidharma Kanis! That dog-loving assassin! Edgeworth: This means that there is a hidden connection between the three of them. Kay: I wonder what it could be? Edgeworth: I don't know, but it must be related to this case. Report on Knightley jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Ah! There's some other stuff in here that I remember seeing! Edgeworth: Hm? There's something on his finger. Kay: Let's have a closer look! Oh! It looks like an expensive ring! Edgeworth: Don't steal it. Kay: Wha...! I didn't do anything yet! Edgeworth: It's Horace Knightley's... The chessboard and the ring... All of his possessions are inside this safe. Kay: So basically, all of this stuff is evidence from the prison case? Edgeworth: Correct. Kay: Then, the knife and chisel that vanished might be in here too! Let's see. Mr. Knife... Mr. Chisel... Hmm. They're not in there... I guess this is all just Mr. Knightley's stuff. Edgeworth: I see... That's too bad. (Horace Knightley... is dead.) Knightley: EEEEEDGEWOOOOOORTH!!! This game isn't over yet! You hear me! I...! I...! Edgeworth: (However, the game is not over yet... ...unless I can see it through to its end!) Knightley's Mementos data jotted down in my Organizer. Grand Tower - Rooftop ???: Young lady, good sir. ...Might I interest you in some cotton candy? Edgeworth: Hm? ???: There is also ice cream, if that is what you'd prefer? Edgeworth: Y-You! Sh-Shelly de Killer! de Killer: It's good to see you are well, Mr. Edgeworth. Kay: Wh-What are you doing in a place like this!? de Killer: As you can see, I am selling cotton candy. Would you care for some \"Heavenly Cotton Candy\"? Even sweeter than death. One bite will send you straight to heaven. Edgeworth: (That's definitely not something I'd want to buy from De Killer.) de Killer: The meaning of my message... Have you understood it? de Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Edgeworth: Have you been spying on us this whole time? de Killer: Spying? Heavens no. I was simply watching over you... ...while disguised as a cotton candy salesman. Edgeworth: (Isn't that the exact same thing!? What is this man's objective?) Were you the one... who murdered the president? de Killer: No. The contact with my client has already expired. ...President Huang is a bit of a celebrity in the world of assassins, you see. Over the years, many attempts on his life were made, and yet, he stubbornly lives on. He is a robust man, surrounded by flawless security. He even employs body doubles. Edgeworth: (Robust... That president? Rotund seems more apt.) ...However, it seems this time the president's security wasn't exactly flawless. Kay: Mr. Rooke had only just prevented your previous assassination, but this time...! de Killer: I did not kill him. It is not my principle to kill needlessly. I am also grateful to Rooke, a worthy adversary who was connected to me by fate. Thanks to that man, I did not kill a target who had no value to be killed. Edgeworth: (\"Thanks\" to Rooke preventing the assassination... What does he mean?) de Killer: My client deliberately gave me a false target. ...It was a betrayal most foul. I am now searching for my client. In all likelihood... ...it is the same person you are looking for. Edgeworth: (Is he saying that his client murdered the president?) Just who is this person you are referring to...? de Killer: I, myself, am not allowed to say. It would be a violation of the rules. I cannot disclose the identity of my clients. For to do so would create a problem of trust with my other clients. This is precisely why I am personally searching for them myself. Kay: What are you going to do when you find your client? de Killer: Of course... they shall be rewarded with a punishment most befitting of a traitor. Kay: Whaaaa!? That person... Wh-What'll happen to them? de Killer: ...I will leave that up to your imagination. Edgeworth: (It certainly won't be anything pleasant...) de Killer: Oh, yes... I will tell you just one more thing. Three days ago, Bodhidharma Kanis escaped from prison. Edgeworth: What!? de Killer: Three nights past, Kanis's solitary cell was found vacant. It was almost as if he knew I would come pay a visit. Edgeworth: (He visited Kanis's cell? Could it be, that the person De Killer is searching for is...) de Killer: Well then, if you'll excuse me, I must get going. Let us both do our best in tracking down that person... Edgeworth: (So, De Killer and Kanis. These two assassins...) Outside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza Edgeworth: (Hmm. This sound is...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Judge Gravelle's cellphone is ringing! Edgeworth: (Could it be Shaun?) ???: Mr. Edgeworth. How are you doing? Edgeworth: (It sounds like they're using a voice changer...) Who is this? ???: Someone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood... Edgeworth: (The red hood?) ...Are you the person who ambushed Kay? ???: Brilliant deduction! I'd expect no less from a prodigy prosecutor such as yourself! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I wanna listen in on this too! Edgeworth: Very well. (I'll put it on speaker...) ???: Well, I must say that I didn't expect the girl to get amnesia. Kay: Hey! What's that supposed to mean!? ???: But that's not all, y'see. Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane. Edgeworth: What!? (This must be the person De Killer spoke of...!) ???: I really should thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: You have no reason to thank me! ???: Oh, you haven't noticed? My, that's troublesome, y'know. I wanted you to catch Blaise for me... ...so I took dear little Kay. Edgeworth: What? ???: If Kay was suspected, I knew you would investigate the case. And I was sure that the great Miles Edgeworth would be able to catch Blaise! It was according to my plan! And y'know, I get the feeling that you have the wrong idea, so let me clear something up. Blaise Debeste wasn't the one who kidnapped Ms. Gravelle's son. Edgeworth: ! You... Why do you know about the kidnapping? ???: You and Ms. Gravelle are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you... Edgeworth: (How could this person know something like that...? Judge Gravelle was supposed to have visited me using the detective's name...) ???: I bet you're wondering how I knew about the kidnapping, right? It's quite simple, really! It's because darling little Shaun is in my care right now. Edgeworth: What!? Kay: Huh!? ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Quickly, little Kay! You have to hurry and steal him back! You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you? Kay: You even know it's my first job!? Edgeworth: (Why does this person know everything in so much detail?) ???: Well... I suppose I can't blame you for your mistake. It seems Blaise was after Shaun as well, y'see. Edgeworth: (So there were two kidnappings...) ???: He's such a fool, y'know. Kidnapping his own son instead! Edgeworth: Is Shaun there with you? If he is, then I would like to hear his voice. ???: Hmm. He's here, but I'm afraid I can't do that. Y'see, he's asleep right now. Edgeworth: In that case, there's no way for us to know if you really kidnapped Shaun or not. ???: ...Hmph. I suppose you don't have to believe me if you don't want to. Edgeworth: What is your objective? Is it to get Fifi Laguarde declared not guilty? ???: A not guilty verdict, eh... I couldn't care less about that. Edgeworth: (So his objective is different from Blaise's?) ???: ...I think I'll keep my objective a secret for now. Well then, I must be going. I hope you enjoy yourself, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Don't think you can get away with this. ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: Ngh...! Kay: Who in the world was that...? Edgeworth: I don't know. We don't have enough information. Kay: Darn it! We're totally clueless! Meanwhile, they seem to know everything about us! Edgeworth: ! (Know everything about us...?) Kay, you're right. Thinking about it, it is strange. How does the culprit know so much about us? Kay: It's so weird! I mean they even know about the kidnapping! Edgeworth: We must figure out how the culprit was able to obtain that information. (I must recall... What exactly did that person know?) ???: You and Ms. Gravelle are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you... ???: You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you? Kay: You even know it's my first job!? ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Edgeworth: (That's it! By analyzing our conversation with the culprit...!) I've figured it out, Kay. I know the source of this person's information! Kay: What!? Really!? Edgeworth: In all likelihood, this person probably... Edgeworth: I believe it is highly likely that we have been bugged. Kay: B-Bugged!? Edgeworth: If you recall what that person said... ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Edgeworth: If they couldn't see our faces, that means they weren't talking our pictures or following us. Kay: Th-Then, they must've planted a bug somewhere! Could it be in my stuff...? Edgeworth: (Was there anything they could have had a chance to bug...? There must be a hint somewhere in our conversation just now... That's right... that person knew something they shouldn't have. The conversation between Judge Gravelle and myself in the visitor's room...) Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! Gravelle: Hush. Please, have a seat. Edgeworth: (The only evidence I had with me at the time was...!) Where was the bug planted...? Edgeworth: Kay. May I see your badge? Kay: My Yatagarasu's badge? No way! Edgeworth: Wh-Why not...? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, just because you became a Great Thief's assistant... ...doesn't mean you're ready to wear this badge yet! Edgeworth: That's not it! It's very likely that a bug was planted in it. Kay: Whaaat!? In my badge? Edgeworth: Let's take a closer look. Kay: Ah! This is...! Edgeworth: It seems I was right. Yatagarasu's Badge data updated in my Organizer. Kay: How did you know? Edgeworth: The person had been in contact with you. Kay: You mean, when I was knocked unconscious. Edgeworth: Yes. That's why I thought one of your possessions might have been bugged. However, that person also overheard my conversation with Judge Gravelle. Even though that conversation took place in the visitor's room with just the two of us... Kay: Ah, so you were holding onto it at that time... Edgeworth: Exactly. All the other evidence had been taken away from me... Only the Yatagarasu's badge remained with me. Kay: So this creep's been listening in on us the whole time! Edgeworth: Indeed. That must be how they knew about all the information we collected. Kay: Does that mean... they're also listening in on this conversation? Edgeworth: Most likely. Kay: Hey, buster! Edgeworth: K-Kay... Kay: Eavesdropping is for cowards! Why don't you come out here and fight us fair and square!? Edgeworth: (Hm? What was that sound just now?) Nicole: Owwwwwwww... Kay: Huh? That's... Nicole! Nicole: Honestly, y'all scared the bejeezus out of me! Your voice was so loud there, Lil' Missy... I was so surprised I done fell flat on my behind! Kay: I-I'm sorry...! Nicole: What were ya gettin' so riled up for? Kay: You gotta hear this! It really grinds my gears! Nicole: Yes, yes? Edgeworth: ...Kay. Please just leave it at that. Unless you want to make tomorrow morning's headlines. Kay: Ah! That was close... Nicole: Aww, shucks. Don't be such a stick in the mud... What's wrong with lettin' a gal open her heart and spill the beans? Edgeworth: (For now, I'll turn the bug off.) Bug data jotted down in my Organizer. Nicole: So... did ya find the kidnappers? Edgeworth: Ms. Swift. Was the boy you saw being kidnapped... ...this boy in the photo? Nicole: Hmm? Nope, they ain't nothin' alike. He had a more stupid-lookin' face, and was wearin' a collared school uniform... Kay: I thought so... Edgeworth: (Yet again, we were led astray by this woman's testimony...) We will have to conduct our investigation all over again. So, we're back where we started. Are there any new leads...? (There's only 20 minutes left until 2 o'clock! Will we be able to make it in time...?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Mr. Edgeworth! About that phone call just now... Wasn't there a strange sound at the end? Edgeworth: A strange sound...? Edgeworth: Don't think you can get away with this. ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: Now that you mention it... It sounded like an explosion (Sound of an explosion - Sound of an explosion was heard during the call from the kidnapper.). It might be a hint to establish the culprit's whereabouts... Nicole: Mm-hmm. I see, I see. The sound of an explosion, eh? Edgeworth: Hmph! I would appreciate it if you stopped eavesdropping on us! Nicole: Mr. Prosecutor... Yer as stingy as ever. Edgeworth: (...First, let's see what she has to say...) (Clearing all \"Talk\" options of Nicole leads to:) Nicole's Tape Recorder data jotted down in my Organizer. ???: Mr. Edgewooooorth! Edgeworth: Mr. Saint, Ms. Berry! Simeon: D-Did you find him? Kay: Not yet. Just where could Shaun be...? Simeon: Shaun? Kay: Ah! No, no! It's nothing! Don't worry about it. Edgeworth: (They don't know anything about the kidnapping.) Regarding Sebastian, we found him not too long ago. Simeon: Really!? That's great! Thank you so much! Now I won't be arrested again. Edgeworth: Based on the explosion sound we heard from the kidnapper's phone... ...we know that Shaun is being confined some place in the vicinity of the Coliseum. Kay: One of the garbage dumps is right next to the Coliseum! Edgeworth: Shaun was almost certainly taken there. In which case... the place he is being confined to must also be somewhere close by. Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Could I ask you to search the area around this garbage dump? Gumshoe: .....You don't have to ask me like we're strangers, sir! It feels... so distant. ...Please just order me around like you normally do. Edgeworth: Are you sure, Detective? Right now I'm not a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Didn't I tell you, sir? Detectives don't just investigate for the sake of prosecutors! Edgeworth: ...You have my thanks, Detective. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth. Look. It's almost time...! Edgeworth: Yes. It would be best if we hurry. They should also be at their limit. Detective Gumshoe, I'm counting on you! Gumshoe: Leave it to me, sir! This may be an unofficial investigation... ...but I'll call in all of my pals from the station to help! Kay: I'll help too! Stealing Shaun back is my job, after all! Edgeworth: I'll be returning to the courtroom. I might be able to draw out some more time. Kay: Oookay! Well then! Even in the depths of... night... Edgeworth: Hmm. The clock just struck 2...! We have to hurry! Gumshoe: Yessir! Kay: Aaah, my introduction! ...When no other bird dares to take fliiight... Blaise: Well, well, well. If it isn't former Prosecutor Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Blaise Debeste...!) Franziska: Witness! Face forward! We're not done talking yet! Blaise: Like I said, y'see. Why exactly would I have needed to help that person out, Your Honor? Blaise: Y'know, it's a crying shame. Having a beautiful woman declared guilty. Honestly, it brings tears to my eyes. But y'see, there's no reason for me to go out of my way to hide evidence just to save her. Franziska: Franziska: However, we still have the testimony of your son, Prosecutor Debeste! He testified that he handed the evidence over to you! Blaise: Hmm. Well, I haven't the slightest clue what he was talking about. I simply can't imagine why Sebastian would have said something like that, y'know. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What if there is evidence that shows your connection with Warden Laguarde? Blaise: Hm? And just what do you think you're doing, \"Former\" Prosecutor Edgeworth? I was under the impression that you were no longer in any position to stand in court? Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! How dare you barge into my prosecutor's bench... Edgeworth: Franziska. I'm sorry. I need you to lend me the bench for a little while. Franziska: Wh-What are you saying...!? Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! I've brought vital evidence related to this case. Your Honor, please allow me to testify! Gravelle: ........ Blaise: Hah hah hah! She'd never allow it! Ray: Ray: Gravelle-pie. Uncle Ray also asks that he be allowed to testify. There are no objections from the prosecution either, right? Franziska: .......... Understood. The prosecution also has no objections. Blaise: Blaise: There's no way you can allow something like this, y'know. Such high-handed methods... ...surely are enough to warrant being held in contempt of court. Wouldn't y'say, Gravelle? Gravelle: ........ Edgeworth: (Ngh! As long as Shaun is still in danger... ...Judge Gravelle cannot rule against the warden. I must convey to her somehow that the search for her son is progressing!) Judge Gravelle. I ask that you have faith in me and my assistant. Franziska: Now that you mention it, where exactly is she...? Edgeworth: She is currently out searching for the most important piece of evidence. Blaise: Blaise: It's a waste of time. There's no such evidence. Are you stalling for time? How disgraceful. Ray: Ray: Most important piece of evidence, huh? ...Gravelle-pie. I don't really know what that evidence is, but I think we should have faith in her. After all, even if she may not look like it, she's still the Great Thief Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: (Somehow... it seems that Mr. Shields understands.) Judge Gravelle! We've already determined the general location of that evidence. It's only a matter of time before she steals the evidence back. Gravelle: ! ......I understand. Then I shall give you special permission to testify. Edgeworth: ...Thank you, Your Honor. Blaise: This is ridiculous! Gravelle: This vital evidence that you have found... Please present it to the court! Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste and Fifi Laguarde are somehow connected. Allow me to present the evidence that proves it! (Which piece of evidence shows the relationship between Fifi Laguarde and Blaise Debeste?) Edgeworth: This document contains a detailed report regarding the interrogation of a certain man. Ray: A certain man? Edgeworth: That man being the late Horace Knightley. And, the one who interrogated him was the defendant in this trial, Fifi Laguarde. Ray: ! So that means, that was the interrogation where... Edgeworth: That's right... Fifi Laguarde murdered Knightley in the aftermath of the interrogation. And that very interrogation has been recorded in this written report! Gravelle: That... definitely sounds like vital evidence! Franziska: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. Just now, you referred to that document as a \"written report\". Now, just who in the world was that report written for? Edgeworth: I thought you might ask that, Franziska. And that's precisely what is most important about this report...! We found this document inside the safe in the storeroom on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower. Franziska: The 51st floor... The storeroom for the black market auction! Edgeworth: Indeed. And the Conductor of the auction was you, Blaise Debeste! Blaise: ............ Edgeworth: You received a report about the victim from Warden Laguarde! In the face of this evidence, can you still say you have no connection to this case? Blaise: ......In regards to that, I refuse to answer. Edgeworth: What? Blaise: It has yet to be proven in court that I was the Conductor of the black market auction. Edgeworth: Oh? Have you already forgotten the events of this morning? I believe I had already proved it back then, did I not? Blaise: I will not deny that I was bested by you. However, that was at the crime scene. Who knows if the results will be the same in court. An acquittal is still possible, y'see. ...Until it's been proven in court that I am the Conductor of the black market auctions... ...you can't prove that document was addressed to me. Edgeworth: Your logic is twisted...! Blaise: That's not very nice, y'know. My logic isn't twisted, is it? Gravelle? Don't you feel the same way? It was quite unlike you to allow Former Prosecutor Edgeworth's statement just now, y'know. ...It saddens me, y'see. That you would fail to uphold the law as a judge should. In fact, I'm so upset by this, I may have no other choice but to use my last resort, y'know. Gravelle: .....I-It is as you say. Something that has not been proven in court does not merit any deliberation. I will have to... overrule... Mr. Edgeworth's claim. Edgeworth: (Ngh... As I thought, until Shaun has been rescued...) Blaise: Y'see? The truth at the scene and the truth in the courtroom are two very different things. Edgeworth: So, you're saying the truth can be distorted in court, as long as it's for your sake? Blaise: What a horrible thing to say. I'm not distorting the truth or anything like that, y'know. If a not guilty verdict is handed down, then that becomes the truth. That's all it is, y'see. Edgeworth: (It's useless. There's nothing we can do useless the missing evidence turns up...) Blaise: Now then, Gravelle. Why don't you deliver a Not Guilty verdict and let's get this over with? After all, that evidence... isn't gonna show up any time soon, y'know. ???: Gravelle: Wh-Who raised an objection just now? Debeste: ...P-Pops... Blaise: .....Sebastian. Debeste: ......Uugh. Blaise: Why did you come back here, now of all times? Gravelle: Sebastian! What is the meaning of this? Franziska: Just where were you and what have been doing since you abandoned your own trial? Debeste: I-I'm sorry. I was... umm... Franziska: Such an act is unbecoming of a prosecutor! You should be ashamed! Debeste: I... umm... well... Blaise: Sebastian. You still don't get it, y'know. This court has no place for sniveling child such as yourself! Debeste: .....Pops.....! I...... I...! I-I've come to present new evidence, Your Honor! So, so... please! Let me take my place back at the prosecutor's bench! Edgeworth: (Sebastian...! I didn't think he would come back...) Blaise: Blaise: Hah hah hah hah! What's all this now, Sebastian? You don't seem at all like your normal self! Debeste: ........Uugh. Pops... Blaise: Hm? Come now! What's the matter? You want Daddy to play with you? Is that it? Well then, why don't we just head on back home. Debeste: R-Return to the witness stand. Blaise: What's wrong? You're shaking like a leaf. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! The prosecutor officially in charge of this case has just arrived with new evidence. The trial is still in session. In light of this, shouldn't we continue with the proceedings? Gravelle: ........ Ray: Naturally, the defense has no objections, Your Honor. I'm sure the defense attorney originally in charge would say the same. Franziska: .....The prosecution has no objections, either, Your Honor. Gravelle: .......... Blaise: Continue with the proceedings? That won't be necessary. Isn't that right? Gravelle. Edgeworth: (Blaise still believes that he was the one who kidnapped Shaun. As long as Shaun still hasn't been found... ...Judge Gravelle will remain bound by Blaise, and nothing else will change that!) Gravelle: .......... Th-That sound is... Edgeworth: (Her cell phone...!) Hm...! (My phone as well...?) Ray: Eh? Uncle Ray's phone is also...! Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! Kay: Mr. Shields! Gumshoe: We've found Shaun, sir! Kay: We rescued Shaun! Edgeworth: Excellent work, Detective! Ray: That kid was the most important piece of evidence, right? Way to go, Kay! Kay: Eheheh! I wanted to spread the word quickly, so I had everyone call! Edgeworth: .....Judge Gravelle. It's for you. Gravelle: ..... Gravelle: .......Yes. I see. I'm..... I'm so glad you're safe...! Make sure you properly thank everyone. OK? ............Be careful, and come home safe. Gravelle: ...Let us resume the proceedings. Now that I may once again swing my gabel to my heart's content. Blaise: Hah...! You're kidding, right? This is just a sad joke, y'know! Gravelle: Witness! This is no joke! Please return to the stand! Prosecutor Debeste, as well. Promptly return to your seat at the prosecutor's bench! Debeste: Y-Yes, Your Honor! Franziska: ........Sebastian Debeste. Debeste: Y-Yes, Ms. von Karma...!? Franziska: .....I leave the rest to you. Debeste: Huh...? Franziska: \"Going up against your own father...\" It won't be easy. I shall observe how things pan out... from the gallery. Gravelle: Now then, allow me to ask once more... Is the prosecution ready? Prosecutor Debeste. What is this new evidence you wish to present...? Debeste: .....The missing knife and chisel, Your Honor. Ray: You mean they've finally been found!? Gravelle: Prosecutor Debeste! Is this true!? Debeste: ...Th-The knife and chisel... I wasn't able to find them... I searched and searched! I really did! But... it was already too late... Edgeworth: (Too late...?) Ray: What do you mean? Debeste: I remembered... This morning, when I passed by Pops in the garage at home... ...he was holding something wrapped in a newspaper. Debeste: Pops, where are you going? Blaise: Ah, Sebastian. Just taking out some trash. Debeste: At that moment, I heard it. .....The faint sound of a bell. Ray: Could that sound have been, by any chance... Edgeworth: ...the bell attached to Kanis's chisel!? Gravelle: In other words... you're saying that the witness threw away the evidence? Blaise: ........ Debeste: I searched for it, but I didn't make it in time. I'm sorry... Ray: Where exactly did you search for it? Debeste: The garbage dump! I went to the garbage dump and searched everywhere! I thought the evidence Pops threw away had to be there...! Edgeworth: Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?) Kay: Ah! What're you doing here? Debeste: WHOOOOOOOAAAHH! Kay: H-He ignored us... Edgeworth: (So at that time, he had gone to the garbage dump...) Debeste: But... but... ...this was all I could find. Gravelle: This is...? It smells rather peculiar... Ray: Now that you mention it, there's kind of a funky smell coming from you as well... Debeste: Wh-What do you expect!? I was digging through garbage! Edgeworth: And what of the knife? Debeste: I think it's buried somewhere in that giant mountain of trash... ...but I couldn't find it by myself. Gravelle: ...I understand. I shall accept this into evidence. Blaise: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Well done, Sebastian! You never betray my expectations, y'know! You searched so desperately through the garbage and that's all you have to show for it? Debeste: Urk...! Blaise: Awww, what a tear-jerker! I'm tearing up already! Ray: Ray: It's a bit too early for tears, don't you think? We haven't examined the evidence properly yet. Blaise: ...I think it's just a pointless waste of time, y'know. Ray: I'm counting on you. Sebastian, Miles. Show him that the truth can be exposed in court and take him down! Edgeworth: (Mr. Shields is backing us up. Now all we need is a breakthrough...!) Prosecutor Debeste. Let's take a closer look at the evidence. Debeste: R... Right! Edgeworth: Let's have a look inside. (It'd be great if we could find some kind of proof.) This is... the bell that was attached to Kanis's chisel... Are there any traces left behind on it? Debeste: .....Ack, it's no good. There's not even a single smudge on it... Gravelle: What did you find, Prosecutor Debeste!? Blaise: Did you even find anything? Debeste: D... Darn it... Blaise: Of course you'd find nothing. Something like that can't be called evidence, y'know. All it is, is trash. It may be sad, but that's the truth, y'see. Edgeworth: (Were Sebastian's efforts all for naught...?) Indeed, this bell does not seem to be valid evidence... (However...) Debeste: Mr. Edgeworth! Are you really giving up!? Blaise: Calm as always, Edgeworth. Quite unlike Sebastian here! Gravelle: ...Well then, is the prosecution finished with its argument? Debeste: Debeste: Verity, not yet! We're not through yet! There's still something we haven't examined! Blaise: You're still not giving up? Struggling in vain's not cute at all, y'know. Edgeworth: (It seems Sebastian hasn't given up yet either. I was just thinking the exact same thing. The last item remaining... Is it trash, or is it evidence...? If we don't examine it, we'll never find out... The item I'm thinking of is...) Debeste: We're still not done examining the newspaper that the bell was wrapped in! Edgeworth: (It seems that Sebastian has the same idea as I do.) Blaise: Wow, this is just wonderful, y'know. So wonderful, it's to cry for. Is it desperation, or simply reckless abandon? Are you really going to... pin all your hopes on a worthless scrap of newspaper? Edgeworth: Heh. We won't know for sure whether or not it's \"worthless\" until we examine it, will we? Sebastian. Let's examine it posthaste. Edgeworth: Is this... a handprint? Debeste: ! There's something greasy on here too... Is it oil? Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! We'd like to request a fingerprint analysis on this paper! Could you please summon someone from forensics? Gravelle: Your request is accepted. Contact the lab at once! Forensics: Reporting! These are definitely fingerprints! However... it's from a glove! Debeste: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? Blaise: Didn't I tell you? It's nothing but a worthless scrap of paper. Just thinking about it, y'know. When handling important evidence... ...what kind of idiot wouldn't use gloves!? Oh wait, wouldn't that be you? The idiot who doesn't know when to give up. Ray: ...That's pretty harsh, talking to your son like that. Blaise: What's wrong with calling an idiot an idiot? If you want to be The Best, you have to be heartless. I have no compassion worthless individuals, not even my own son! Debeste: Pops...! I.....! Blaise: Y'know, you've always called yourself a genius prosecutor, haven't you? Didn't I explain to you this morning why you were a genius up until now? That's right. It was all because of me. Because of my authority. You were always being protected. By people like Gravelle... and me. Debeste: ........Uuunghh. Blaise: Now, get that stinking face of yours out of my sight. Debeste: Stinking... Blaise: Y'know, now that I think about it, that stench might just suit you perfectly. Just keep it away from my nose, or my eyes will start watering. Debeste: Debeste: Wrong... You're wrong, Pops. Blaise: ...Sebastian? What are you talking about? Debeste: ...You're the one who stinks, Pops. It's you, not me! Blaise: What...? Debeste: ...You haven't noticed, have you? You smell, Pops. So much that you can't even hide it. Mr. Edgeworth... Try smelling the hand print on the newspaper. Edgeworth: The smell...? ...Hmm. It smells... like oil... Debeste: I know something that smells just like it... Edgeworth: (Come to think of it, back then...) Edgeworth: (It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.) Debeste: That's right... The smell proves it. It proves that the culprit who hid the evidence was...! It's no good... I guess I can't become the best after all. I'm too soft... I could never be so heartless... ...I just can't bring down my father with my own hands. Edgeworth: (Prosecutor Debeste...) ..........Summon... your courage. \"Become a different prosecutor from your father\"... Wasn't that what you decided? Debeste: ! Edgeworth: We are prosecutors. And as prosecutors, we stand in the courtroom. In that case, isn't it our duty to shed light on the truth? Debeste: ........ Edgeworth: Exposing crimes and bringing criminals to justice. Even if the criminal is your own father... ...that is your duty, as a prosecutor. Didn't I promise you? That if you have the courage to stand up... I will show you the way. And if you cannot do it alone, then we shall do it together... Debeste: ...Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Allow me to present the evidence that connects this hand print with my father! Edgeworth: This is the smell of motor oil. The kind used for maintaining motorcycles... Debeste: Both myself and Mr. Edgeworth have smelled this exact same smell before! Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste! It was in your garage! Blaise: ! Edgeworth: And wouldn't you say these fingerprints have a rather peculiar shape? The five letters that spell out D-E-A-T-H. It's exactly the same as your own gloves. Blaise: Blaise: Ha ha ha! You can buy gloves like that from anywhere! It doesn't prove a thing! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that really the case? Debeste: That's not the only thing that these two pieces of evidence have in common! Edgeworth: (The fingerprints on the newspaper that was used to wrap up the bell... ...and Blaise's mechanic's gloves...) This is the unmistakable similarity they both share! Edgeworth: If you examine the imprint left by the letter A, you'll see it's unmistakably from this glove. Blaise: Whaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: And that's not all... There is one more item we must take note of. Namely, these dirt stains. I suggest we do a comparative analysis of the dirt stains from the newspaper and the glove. If the contents match up... then it will prove to be decisive evidence. Gravelle: Bailiff! Please have these dirt samples sent to forensics for analysis immediately! Blaise: Gaaaaaaaarrgh! Edgewooorth! Sebastiaaaan! You lowly prosecutors! Do you have any idea who I am!? Debeste: Pops... you can't run away anymore. It's been proven in court that you concealed the evidence. And that you tried to cover for the defendant... Blaise: Y-You're saying that I'm... Guilty? That I'll be sent to prison...? Me, Blaise Debeste? A couple of snot-nosed punks are gonna make me disappear!? There must be some mistake! Debeste: Debeste: Be a man and admit your crimes! Blaise: Blaise: Do you really think you can survive if I'm not around? Debeste: I..... I'll be fine now. I thought I wanted to be the best prosecutor, so I could get your approval, Pops. But, when I was kidnapped by your men... and stuck in that dark room, I started thinking. \"I am... truly powerless.\" I despaired, and averted my eyes from the truth. But... ...at that moment, Mr. Edgeworth stepped in and showed me the way. And now, I am no longer just a child chasing after his father's approval! I've become capable... I can find evidence on my own now! Blaise: Wha... My men kidnapped you? Why were you...!? Debeste: Debeste: Pops, I'll show you the truth you never knew... through this trial. Blaise: Sebastiaaan! How dare you speak to me like that...! You should've just stayed as an idiot son! Debeste: You may have hated me to the very end, Pops... ...but I... I've always looked up to you. Thank you for everything up until now. .....And goodbye. Blaise: You... Since when did you... All you've ever been able to do was depend on me! SebaSTIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNN! Gravelle: It has been established that the evidence was concealed by Blaise Debeste himself. A judgment regarding his concealment of evidence shall be delivered at a separate trial. The missing chisel and knife still have yet to be found. However, once a search of the waste disposal site is underway, they will surely be discovered. Laguarde: ...The knife will be found? Wh-What will happen to me if it's found? Edgeworth: Heh. No need to worry. You'll simply receive the punishment you deserve for your crime. Laguarde: Grrrr! Punishment? For me!? Blaise, what in the world are you doing!? You! You... After all your boasting about being able to create your own truths and Not Guilty verdicts! That's why I contacted you immediately after the prison incident in the first place! And to make matters worse, you even kidnapped the wrong kid! I just can't believe this! You really, really, really are... completely useleeeeeessss! Edgeworth: ...That was certainly a violent outburst. But you heard her, Prosecutor Debeste. Debeste: Yeah. She got flustered and said a bunch of important stuff! ...Right? Edgeworth: Indeed... That's correct. (He still doesn't seem very sure of himself...) Gravelle: Very well. And with that, this court is adjourned. ???: Edgeworth: What? Franziska: Huh!? Gravelle: Wh-Who are you? Lang: Judge Gravelle. It's still too early for a happy ending. Lang Zi says: \"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case.\" Gravelle: And who... might you be? Lang: The name's Shi-Long Lang. I'm just a humble, lone investigator. Gravelle: Do you have some objection with this trial? Lang: Hah! Not a chance! The defendant there has a heart as black as a moonless night. Laguarde: Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...? Lang: You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree? Edgeworth: Agent Lang. What are you talking about? Lang: The SS-5 Incident from 12 years ago... It's a case I'll never forget. Edgeworth: (12 years ago...?) Lang: ......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa. Edgeworth: (12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?) Edgeworth: (Might it have something to do with Lang's father and President Huang?) Lang: Fifi Laguarde. And you, Blaise Debeste. Back then, the two of you killed off the Lang clan... Laguarde: Rrgh... Gravelle: Were you involved in the incident 12 years ago? Lang: That's right, I was. However... I'm not here to chase after ghosts of the past. I'm here for you, Verity Gravelle...! Gravelle: M... Me? Lang: You, and one other... Shaun: .......... Gravelle: Shaun! Lang: Ms. Gravelle! You're coming along too! As a suspect in the murder of the president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang! What evidence do you...!? Lang: Lang: Settle down, Mr. Prosecutor. The investigation has only just begun. We're going to inspect the crime scene with the suspects in attendance. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang... did he get his hands on some new pieces of evidence?) Lang: If you have any objections, then you can tag along as well. Edgeworth: ...I shall do just that. Shaun: ........ Edgeworth: (\"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case\"... There are still many mysteries yet unsolved surrounding the murder of the president... Namely, the true nature of the \"giant monster\", and...) ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: (The true identity of the person on the other end of the phone...) To be continued. \n-- Shaun's Rehearsal -- Shaun: I wasn't feeling too great during yesterday's shoot, so I made a few bloopers. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. You said you didn't feel well. Could you tell me more concretely what was wrong? Shaun: That doesn't matter! I just wasn't feeling well, alright!? Kay: You weren't feeling well... Maybe you drank too much milk? Shaun: Wha... How'd you...!? Ah, no, I mean, that's not it... Edgeworth: (So he didn't feel well because of his stomach...) Kay: When I was young, I was told that chewing milk makes it easier on your stomach, y'know? Shaun: Th-This conversation is over! Anyways, I made a few bloopers. Shaun: They're reshooting the scene today, so... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So they planned to reshoot the scene today. And you were practicing for that last night. Shaun: ...My mistakes caused a lot of trouble for the people around me. I'm a pro, so practicing that much more is natural. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He certainly does have an admirable sense of responsibility.) Penny: Shaun is incredibly dedicated to his craft. He didn't even make any major mistakes in those bloopers. But he said if it would make the movie just a tiny bit better... Shaun: Shut up! You don't need to go around blabbering about stupid stuff like that! Penny: Ah... I-I'm sorry. Edgeworth: (If only he was a little more cooperative, I'd have no complaints.) Shaun: Hmph... Anyway, that's what happened. Shaun: Well, I decided to rehearse a little on my own. That's all. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. About your testimony just now... Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Don't I always tell you!? If you're going to practice by yourself, you have to let me know beforehand! Shaun: I-I-I know! Edgeworth: (...My time to speak was completely stolen away from me.) I shall ask you once more. Shaun, about your testimony just now... Kay: But you know, Shaun, I think that's really great! Edgeworth: (Mmph... A-Again!?) Kay: I bet putting in an honest effort like that will make someone even more talented. You'll go from a little thief to a Middle Thief, and then someday you'll become a Great Thief! I'll be doing my best, so you do your best too! OK, Shaun? Edgeworth: ........Ahem. Now then, if I may? Shaun. Do you often rehearse in that way? (At last... At long last, I finally got to ask my question...!) Shaun: I do it all the time. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There are no mistakes in that testimony, correct? Shaun: O-Of course there's no mistakes! It was just a normal, peaceful night! Nothing out of the ordinary happened at all! Kay: A... A peaceful night!? How can you say that when an incident like this has occurred!? Edgeworth: Kay, he is still a child. Please don't get seriously angry. Present Moozilla's Head Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that? Shaun: ...! I don't know anything about it. Edgeworth: Is that true? Shaun: I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something? Edgeworth: (...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after Shaun had already gone back...) Shaun: If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We're not done talking yet! Shaun: What now? Edgeworth: The falling monster's head wasn't the only unusual thing that happened last night. And this is something you should be well aware of. What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling? Present Monster's Footprints or Shaun's Practice Video Edgeworth: Leads to: \"We have evidence right here.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. Take a look at this. Shaun: And what's that supposed to be? Edgeworth: Don't you understand? This shows what happened last night. Shaun: ...... Edgeworth: Hmph... Have I left you speechless? Shaun: ...You're so far off the mark that I have nothing to say. Edgeworth: Argh! (Was I really that far off...?) Kay: Let's review what happened here last night one more time! Edgeworth: Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer! Kay: Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night? Leads back to: \"What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling?\" Edgeworth: We have evidence right here. Shaun: Ah! Could that be...!? Edgeworth: That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance. Shaun: ........Ugh. Lang: What!? You're telling me you have video from last night!? Edgeworth: Exactly. And in this video... ...there is clearly something that is out of the ordinary. Lang: Th-This is... a monster's footprint...! Edgeworth: Would you say that monster's footprints are commonplace on a film set? Gravelle: Shaun... Why did you conceal this video from us? Shaun: ........No reason, really. Lang: Lang: Hey, pup! This is no joking matter! You had a reason to hide it, right? Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Answer him clearly! Shaun: But Mom..... Edgeworth: Well? Shaun: ...I didn't want anyone to see me rehearsing. Lang: ........ Kay: ........ Edgeworth: ........ In other words, you're embarrassed about others seeing you practice. Shaun: ...Yeah. Got a problem with that!? Lang: Lang: You're saying that's why you hid the evidence? Gravelle: Shaun! Shaun: Eep! ...Quit nagging me. You've already busted me, what more do you want? Yeah, the footprints were there, but I just practiced and headed home. Lotta: How come yer so calm after findin' those footprints!? It's a monster, ya know!? A real live monster! Shaun: ...I thought it was just a part of the set. Besides, there's lots of other weird stuff around here too. Nicole: He's suspicious, Chief! This kid's really suspicious! Lotta: Yer right! The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven! Shaun: ...Shut up. We're done talking! Lang: Leads to: \"Wait up...\" Present Monster's Footprints or Shaun's Practice Video Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? We have evidence right here. Shaun: Ah! Could that be...!? Edgeworth: That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance. Shaun: ........Ugh. Lang: What!?

The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven! Shaun: ...Shut up. We're done talking! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We're not done here yet! Shaun: What now? Edgeworth: The monster's footprints weren't the only unusual things that happened last night. Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night? Present Moozilla's Head Edgeworth: Leads to: \"A monster's head fell from the roof of that building.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This shows what happened here yesterday. Shaun: ...And just what exactly does it show? Edgeworth: You don't understand, do you? You are still a child, after all. Shaun: I don't need some guy who's less intelligent than a child telling me that. Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (It seems that wasn't it...) Kay: Let's review what happened here last night one more time! Edgeworth: Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer! Kay: Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night? Leads back to: \"Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night?\" Edgeworth: A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that? Shaun: ...! I don't know anything about it. Edgeworth: Is that true? Shaun: I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something? Edgeworth: (...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after Shaun had already gone back...) Shaun: If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking! Edgeworth: (It seems that Shaun doesn't really want to talk about last night. Could he be hiding something after all...?) Leads to: \"Wait up...\" Edgeworth: So there was nothing out of the ordinary...? Kay: He doesn't know anything at all about the incident. That's the impression I'm getting. But isn't there evidence that shows something did happen last night? Edgeworth: Yes... I don't have time to waste dealing with a child's lies. Let's present the contradiction. Lang: Wait up... Edgeworth: ? Agent Lang? Lang: Heh heh heh. It's as I thought. Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. This video backs up my logic. Kay: Huh!? Is there something in the video that's related to the case? Lang: Yeah... Take a good, hard look at the monster costume in the top-left. Kay: The Moozilla costume...? Lang: Try comparing it with the one over there right now. Kay: Hmm? It looks like it's just hanging there limply though. And the zipper on its back is zipped up tightly. Edgeworth: (Zipper on its back...?) Wha! (Th-This discrepancy is...!) Lang: Yeah. The difference is plain to see. In the video, the zipper is clearly open! That's right... Someone was inside. Kay: WHAAAAAAAT! Edgeworth: Mr. Powers! Is the costume's zipper usually...? Powers: It's always zipped up tightly when it's not in use... Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. Do you remember? My logic from before... Lang: Two nights ago, Gravelle pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body. Edgeworth: In here? Lang: Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Edgeworth: You're saying the body... was hidden inside the costume? Lang: Yeah, that's right! Judge Gravelle! Two nights ago, you pushed the president off the roof of the tower. You then hid the body inside the monster costume! Gravelle: I... I did no such thing! Lang: Lang: Say what you want, but you're the only one who could've done it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That should have already been proven impossible. The film lot was locked at the time! Judge Gravelle could not have entered this place! Lang: Lang: ...And what if there was an accomplice? Edgeworth: What? Lang: I'll tell you my reasoning, so listen up. -- Mother and Son Theory -- Lang: When the president was pushed off the roof, Shaun was waiting at the film lot. If Shaun was an accomplice, the problem with the locks would be resolved. The two of them then hid the president's body. Inside that monster costume over there... Edgeworth: You think this crime had such an elaborate plan? Lang: To take the life of a nation's president. An elaborate plan is to be expected, don't you think? Gravelle: Gravelle: Shaun would never... take part in such a crime! Lang: Lang: You're the one being suspected. Your words don't carry much weight! Edgeworth: I wouldn't think those two had sufficient motive for something like this, though? Lang: Well, maybe they had a motive that we didn't know about? You were the last one to meet with the president. And you're still keeping the details secret. Don't you think it's only natural that you're being suspected? Gravelle: ...... Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Is there no way for you to tell us your secret. Gravelle: M-My apologies. I just cannot, no matter what... However, when the time I can talk about it comes, I will surely let you know. So, if you could please... Lang: Believe you? Is that what you wanted to say? That's what all criminals say. And you, pup... If you've got an explanation, hurry up and spit it out. Shaun: Hmph. I didn't do nothing. ...That's all I'm saying. Lang: Both mother and son won't talk. You still gonna defend 'em like this? Edgeworth: It's true, Judge Gravelle's actions are a mystery... ...however, we still don't know whether or not that ties in with a motive for murder. Lang: Yeah, that's right. Their motive for murder can wait. For now, let's talk about the situation surrounding the crime. ...And the fact that these two are the only ones who could've done it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang. Don't tell me you're saying Shaun was an accomplice? Kay: Shaun still looks like a grade school kid, he's even got a kiddy backpack to boot! How could he be an accomplice...? There's just no way! Penny: Like I said, Shaun's already in middle school, and the backpack is a part of his costume... Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says! \"No matter how young the cub, never pity an ungrateful pup.\" He may be a little brat, but a villain deserves no mercy. Kay: Uuuh... So Mr. Lang Zi didn't make any allowances for age... Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. You're not just defending him 'cause he's a pup, are you? Edgeworth: Hmph. Of course, that was never my intention. I shall present suitable evidence in due course. Lang: Oh? I'm looking forward to it. My logic's just getting started. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How would that... resolve the problem!? Lang: I figured you'd ask that, Mr. Prosecutor. But y'know, it's actually quite simple. Listen up... First, that woman pushes the president off the roof. Kay: Hmm... she pushes him off. Lang: Then, that brat, who knew the combination for the lock, unlocks the film lot. Kay: I see... the combination unlocks the brat! Edgeworth: Kay, it's the opposite. Lang: ...That's all it takes. With this, the problem of the lock is solved. Your theory that she couldn't get in because she didn't know the combination no longer files! Edgeworth: (Hmm... Regarding the lock, that certainly is a plausible explanation...) Agent Lang. Thank you for your clear explanation. Please, continue with what you were saying before. Lang: Hmph. If you're gonna give up, you better do it now. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Supposing those two were accomplices... Why would they have needed to leave the body hanging there for an entire day!? Lang: Lang: Why don't you give it a rest, and take a good hard look at reality. Thanks to their trickery, our investigation has been confused up until now. Doesn't that about answer your question!? ...Got it? Those two hid the body. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In the video, we cannot see the inside of the costume. So can you really say for certain that the body was placed inside? Lang: ...Yeah, I'll give you that much. In that case, why don't we try examining it? The inside of that costume! There might be some traces left inside. Edgeworth: Mr. Powers, may we examine the inside of the costume? Powers: Sure. Go ahead. But it might be kinda stinky, since I sweat a lot in here... Edgeworth: This is... incredibly dirty. Powers: That's strange... We always make sure to clean it after using it, so that the sweat doesn't damage the costume. Lang: Lang: Isn't this just proof that someone besides you used this costume? I'd say that dirt from the body probably got into the costume. Kay: The president's body did fall on top of the monster's footprint. That must be where the dirt came from! Lang: ...Are you satisfied now? Add statement: \"There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, dirt got into the costume when the body was hidden inside. Wouldn't that mean... ...that the dirt was transferred from the body? Lang: Hah! Isn't that obvious? How else would you say it got there? Kay: ...There's dirt stuck everywhere inside the costume. It looks particularly bad around the chest area. Edgeworth: (Dirt around the chest...? We cannot overlook this fact.) Kay: Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense... Edgeworth: Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point. Kay: In that case, what should we do? Edgeworth: Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail. Let's draw out more information.-- Mother and Son Theory -- Lang: When the president was pushed off the roof, Shaun was waiting at the film lot. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang. Don't tell me you're saying Shaun was an accomplice? Kay: Shaun still looks like a grade school kid, he's even got a kiddy backpack to boot! How could he be an accomplice...? There's just no way!

Doesn't that about answer your question!? ...Got it? Those two hid the body. Lang: Inside that monster costume over there... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In the video, we cannot see the inside of the costume. So can you really say for certain that the body was placed inside? Lang: ...Yeah, I'll give you that much. In that case, why don't we try examining it? The inside of that costume! There might be some traces left inside. Edgeworth: Mr. Powers, may we examine the inside of the costume? Powers: Sure. Go ahead. But it might be kinda stinky, since I sweat a lot in here... Edgeworth: This is... incredibly dirty. Powers: That's strange... We always make sure to clean it after using it, so that the sweat doesn't damage the costume. Lang: Lang: Isn't this just proof that someone besides you used this costume? I'd say that dirt from the body probably got into the costume. Kay: The president's body did fall on top of the monster's footprint. That must be where the dirt came from! Lang: ...Are you satisfied now? Add statement: \"There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside.\" Lang: There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, dirt got into the costume when the body was hidden inside. Wouldn't that mean... ...that the dirt was transferred from the body? Lang: Hah! Isn't that obvious? How else would you say it got there? Kay: ...There's dirt stuck everywhere inside the costume. It looks particularly bad around the chest area. Edgeworth: (Dirt around the chest...? We cannot overlook this fact.) Present Crime Scene Notes Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it...\" Kay: Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense... Edgeworth: Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point. Kay: In that case, what should we do? Edgeworth: Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail. Let's draw out more information. Edgeworth: Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it... Is that really the case? Lang: You have a problem with that? Edgeworth: There is a fair amount of dirt inside the front of the costume. Kay: Yeah, that IS a lot of dirt... Edgeworth: However, I would like you to focus on the state the body is in. It's lying on top of the dirt, and yet there's no dirt on the front of the body. If the body really was inside the costume... ...then it's strange that the front of the body isn't stained with more dirt! Lang: Rrgh! Well then, how would you explain it? How did the dirt get inside the costume!? Edgeworth: (From the video footage, it's very likely that someone was inside the costume. But just who could it have been...?) Kay: Hmm... Where have I seen this? Edgeworth: What's the matter, Kay? Kay: I just feel like I remember seeing something that looked like this dirt somewhere before... ...but where was it? There were these bits of gray fragments mixed in with the dirt. Edgeworth: (Gray... fragments? There does seem to be something other than normal dirt mixed into it...) Kay: Something must've gotten stuck to it, and lots of it I might add. Hmm... Edgeworth: (Something got stuck to it? This may merit a closer look. Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?) Present Mechanic's Gloves Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is what you're thinking of, isn't it, Kay? Kay: Oh! Mr. Edgeworth, you sure are sharp! Edgeworth: Hmph... Naturally. Kay: ...But too bad! Not this time! Edgeworth: Argh! (You should have just said that in the first place!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, can't you remember? Dirt, dirt... Where else did we see this dirt? Edgeworth: (Dirt... Wasn't there a piece of evidence that had dirt on it?) Kay: It's on the tip of my brain, but I just can't quite place it. Where on earth have we seen dirt like this before? Leads back to: \"(Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?)\" Edgeworth: This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it. Lang: Huh? And what of it? Edgeworth: We found an item belonging to a certain man, that was covered in the same type of dirt. That is to say, these gloves. Lang: Those dirt stains... certainly look the same. But, tell me... Just what exactly is this grey substance!? Edgeworth: This grey substance is... Plastic Edgeworth: Yes, I believe it's plastic. Your thoughts? Lang: Lang: Hah! You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Prosecutor! Put more \"BANG!\" into your claims, like you usually do! Edgeworth: Ah... Hmm. Lang: As for my opinion on the matter... I'll tell you right now, that stuff is definitely not plastic! Edgeworth: Nngwaaah! (So that wasn't it...) Kay: Let's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it? Edgeworth: Right. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally. Leads back to: \"This grey substance is...\" Concrete Leads to: \"This grey substance must be fragments of concrete.\" Paint Edgeworth: No matter how you look at it, this must be paint! Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor! When did you become so scatterbrained!? No matter how you look at it, this doesn't look like paint! Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (I suppose not...) Kay: Let's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it? Edgeworth: Right. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally. Leads back to: \"This grey substance is...\" Edgeworth: This grey substance must be fragments of concrete. Kay: You mean... the stuff that was scattered around the monster's footprints? Edgeworth: Exactly. Meanwhile, who do these gloves, which are stained with the same kind of dirt, belong to? Kay: Oh, I remember! We found it at Blaise's place! Edgeworth: Earlier today, we went to Blaise's garage. There, we discovered these dirt-stained gloves. Come to think of it, there were also hammers, shovels, and other tools placed inside, as well. Why would mechanic's gloves, intended to be used on machines, be covered in dirt? If he broke the concrete with the hammer, and then dug into the soil with the shovel... ...then it's only natural for dirt like that to get on the gloves. Kay: Then, maybe...! Edgeworth: Yes. The true nature of the monster's footprints... has been made clear. It's possible that these footprints were dug up by Blaise Debeste himself. Lang: Lang: It's possible...? Hmph! It's possible, you say!? Please do enlighten me. 'Cuz I honestly have no clue! Why on earth would he do something like that? Edgeworth: (Why did he make the monster footprints? Thinking about it, the answer must be...) He was digging something up Edgeworth: It's possible he was digging something up. Leads to: \"It probably went something like this.\" He buried something Edgeworth: Could it have been because he buried something? Kay: He buried something!? I smell treasure! So, what did he bury? Edgeworth: If we want to find that out, we'll have to dig it up ourselves. Lang: Lang: You think the police wouldn't have already investigated that? There was absolutely nothing buried beneath those footprints! Edgeworth: Nngwaaah! (It seems that was wrong...) In that case, we should assume the opposite: he dug something up. Leads to: \"It probably went something like this.\" Edgeworth: It probably went something like this. Last night at this spot, there was something that Blaise needed to dig up. For that reason, he broke the lock on the back door ans sneaked into the film lot... Using the hammer and shovel, he set to work. He placed the items he dug up into his bag, but before he could fill in the holes... Kay: Ah! That's when Shaun came to practice! Edgeworth: Exactly. Blaise panicked, and had no choice but to hide himself in the Moozilla costume nearby. Lang: Grr... To think you would deduce so much from just a pair of dirt-stained gloves... However! All of this is merely a possibility! There's still no proof that he was the one who was hiding inside that costume! For all we know, he might've left the scene once he finished digging! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: On the contrary. Such proof does exist, and can be seen... in the video. When this video was recorded, Blaise was definitely inside the film lot. Lang: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (Though I can't blame Agent Lang for not noticing... ...the difference between the current flim lot... ...and the one in Shaun's video. Along with the state of Blaise's garage... ...it's all too clear that Blaise was still here!) What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded? Present duffel bag beside monster costume Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This bag placed near the costume...\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This proves that Blaise was still at the film lot! Kay: Umm... How exactly does it prove that? Lang: Yeah, I'd like a better explanation as well! Edgeworth: ...Argh! (So this has nothing to do with Blaise...) Kay: If something belonging to Blaise could be seen in this video, then proving it would be easy... Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything that comes to mind? Edgeworth: (Something belonging to Blaise... Does anything like that appear in the video?) Lang: Well, Mr. Prosecutor!? How about it...? Is there really any evidence that Blaise Debeste was there? Edgeworth: There's no need to rush, Agent Lang. Leads back to: \"What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded?\" Edgeworth: This bag placed near the costume... There was an identical one inside Blaise's garage. Lang: ! Edgeworth: First, the dirt on the gloves, and now the bag... It seems there is a connection. Mechanic's Gloves data updated in my Organizer. Edgeworth: And that's my proof. Blaise was inside the costume. Ergo, the president's body could not have been hidden inside it! Lang: Aiyaaaaaaaaa! Edgeworth: (It seems I was able to refute Agent Lang's reasoning.) Gumshoe: Someone needs to go investigate Blaise's house right away, pal! We need to know what was inside that bag! Officer: Yessir! Lotta: Y'all pipe down and listen up! Y'all just been sayin' whatever works best for y'all! Edgeworth: (...And the noisy one returns.) Lotta: That there's the footprints of the Mighty Moozilla! They ain't just some random holes dug up by that old coot! Edgeworth: Hmph. I believe the true nature of these footprints has already been proven quite logically. Lotta: Logic schmogic, I ain't buyin' it! Say whatcha want, but I know what I saw, and I saw Moozilla! Edgeworth: (Is she referring to how she saw Moozilla out of the window of the Grand Tower...? Preposterous.) Nicole: Upon our journalist's souls, we ain't havin' none of it! Edgeworth: (That statement is an insult to journalists everywhere...) Nicole: Ah! That's right! There's more to them monsters than just those footprints! I remember hearin' that sonny over there was seen with the monster earlier! I reckon that gal over there said she witnessed it herself! Edgeworth: (When these two are together, all meaningful talk grinds to a halt...) Kay: If we only knew just what the \"monster\" really was, I think those two would quiet down. Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything you can do? Edgeworth: (The monster's true identity...?) We don't have much choice... Let's see what we can do. Lotta: Isn't there somethin' y'all ain't tellin' us about the monster!? Nicole! Ask 'em! Ask 'em right now! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ....Please settle down. Regarding the true identity of that \"monster\", I already know what it is. Lotta: Wha'd ya say!? Edgeworth: That's right. The video Shaun recorded provided the hint that I needed... Lotta: Whatchu talkin' bout? Edgeworth: (Ms. Nichols saw Gourdy... ...when she went to check up on Shaun's practice. At that times, she mistook \"something\" for Gourdy.) The \"monster\" can be seen in this photograph. Lotta: What!? Ain't that just some plain old souvenir photo!? Y'all don't really think ya can pull the wool over the eyes of a pro like me, do ya? Edgeworth: (What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?) Present camera crane Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was...\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The \"Gourdy\" that Ms. Nichols saw... was actually this! Lotta: There ain't no foolin' a real pro! Yer sayin' this is Gourdy!? It don't look nothin' like it! Edgeworth: Argh! (I had my suspicions...) Kay: Let's double-check what Gourdy looks like. Something with a similar shape might be in the photo! Edgeworth: Indeed. (Gourdy's shape...?) Leads back to: \"(What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?)\" Edgeworth: Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was... ...this camera crane! Lotta: Wh-What!? Edgeworth: The video Shaun recorded was shot from fairly high up. A shot from this position would be impossible without a camera crane. Nicole: But...! There ain't no way Ms. Nichols would mistake a camera crane for Gourdy! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I wonder about that. ...Ms. Nichols. Penny: Y-Yes! Edgeworth: Earlier, you said the prescription for your glasses didn't match your eyesight anymore, correct? Penny: Yes. Lately, it seems like my eyesight has suddenly gotten a lot worse. Edgeworth: So would you say that you weren't able to see Gourdy very clearly in the dark? Penny: That's right... Its silhouette was all I could make out... Nicole: But, remember what Ms. Nichols said!? And I quote, \"Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile...\"! Lotta: Camera cranes ain't got no flesh on 'em, let alone skin! It's just a bare steel frame! Edgeworth: That is certainly true. At least, in the case of this photo... However, last night it did have skin. Lotta: Y'all just doin' whatever ya can to get in the way of our big scoop, ain't ya!? Edgeworth: (That was not my intention... ...but since I've come this far, it's time to put an end to your nonsense.) Gourdy's skin is right before our very eyes. This is the \"skin\" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw! Present vinyl sheets Edgeworth: Leads to: \"As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night.\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is the true identity of Gourdy's skin! Lotta: And just how could somethin' like that be taken for skin, ya heinous prosecutor!? Yer just spoutin' nonsense, tryin' to take our whole scoop for yerself! Yer pure evil! Yer a demon prosecutor! Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (That is decidedly not what I'm trying to do.) On its own, the crane bears no resemblance to Gourdy at all. Kay: Something must have been draped over the crane. Edgeworth: (Last night, it looked like it was going to rain... And if that's the case, there's only one thing it could have been!) Leads back to: \"This is the \"skin\" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw!\" Edgeworth: As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night. While it never actually rained... ...Shaun still covered the camera crane with a rainproof sheet. Which, to Ms. Nichols... looked like a monster's skin! Nicole: Whaaaaaaaat! Lotta: Y-Ya gotta be kiddin' meeee! Edgeworth: Isn't that right, Shaun? Shaun: Man, you saw through it all. .....Not bad, old man. Edgeworth: Unfortunately, the \"Gourdy\" that Ms. Nichols saw was nothing more than an illusion. Lotta: Not again... Looks like my dream has shriveled up and died once again... Nicole: M-Mentor! Kay: Seems like things have finally settled down. Lotta: I really thought the boy was hidin' somethin' from me... Guess I had it all wrong. Lang: ...Now that we've figured out the true form of the monster, everyone seems refreshed. Kay: Actually, there's two people here who are totally bummed out. Forensics: Agent Lang! The report is in, sir! We've got the results of President Huang's autopsy! Lang: Good! Show it to me! Lang: \"Contusions and bone fractures found across the body, resulting from tremendous pressure.\" So, this was the cause of death. In other words... he was crushed to death. Edgeworth: (I thought as much...) Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer. Lang: The yellow stain on his chest is currently under investigation... ...but it seems that gunpowder residue was found on his right hand. Kay: Sunflower residue!? I didn't know the president was into gardening! Edgeworth: No, gunpowder residue. Traces of it are left behind when a gun is fired. Since it has been found on his right hand, it's possible that the president fired a gun. Kay: A gun, huh? But we didn't find any guns when we investigated this area. Edgeworth: (...Unexplained gunpowder residue? I'll have to look over the autopsy report later.) Now then, Agent Lang. It seems we have our answer. The president did not die from falling off the roof of the Grand Tower. Rather, he died from being crushed under Moozilla's head! Lang: I can't deny it... Looks like your logic was right after all. Kay: This means the suspicions surrounding Ms. Gravelle should be cleared up, right!? Edgeworth: Yes... Not only the cause of death, but the time of death proves her innocence as well. Judge Gravelle met with the president two nights ago. However, according to the autopsy report, the time of death was around 11 PM last night. Moozilla's head also fell last night... It matches up perfectly. Kay: That's a relief! Lang: Lang: ...Isn't it a bit too early to be relieved? Edgeworth: (Agent Lang?) Lang: The president died after being crushed by the Moozilla's head. That, I will admit. But the problem is, who was responsible for the falling head...? Edgeworth: Moozilla's head fell last night. And last night, the one who was at the film lot was... Gravelle: Gravelle: What are you saying!? Surely, you're not implying... Lang: That's right. You killed him, didn't you? Shaun Fenn! Shaun: ........ Lang: That pup is hiding something. He was at the scene where the body was discovered last night. He also saw the \"footprints\". And despite that, he still claims to know absolutely nothing about the incident? Isn't that a bit too convenient? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: These footprint-shaped holes have not been proven to be related to the case! Just because he saw the holes, doesn't necessarily mean that he's involved in the incident! Lang: Lang: You sure about that? Take a look at the pup's face. Shaun: .............. Lang: He looks pretty shaken up to me. Edgeworth: (It looks like he hit the mark... but Shaun doesn't want to talk about it.) Lang: If he doesn't feel like talking, then I have an idea of my own. Let's check the tape. Edgeworth: Agent Lang. What is your intention? Lang: The police have a device that lets you analyze the video footage up close and personal. Gravelle: Agent Lang. You would suspect Shaun enough to go that far... Edgeworth: (As long as Shaun's lips are sealed... ...this may be the only way for us to get closer to the truth.) Detective Gumshoe! If I'm not mistaken you have that device with you, correct? Gumshoe: Mr. Analysis is ready to go, sir! Lang: Now we're talking! Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth. Would you please perform the video analysis for us? Edgeworth: (She wants me to do it...?) Gravelle: Who knows what kind of faults that wolf-man will find in it! Edgeworth: (This isn't exactly my strong suit, but I suppose I have no choice... Are there any new clues shown on the video?) Monster costume Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It's the Moozilla costume. If you zoom in, you can see that the back is unzipped. Kay: Yeah. Mr. Powers was supposed to get inside to play the monster in the movie. ...But, I don't really get it. The Mozilla in the movie is supposed to be big enough to demolish an entire building. Once he's inside the costume, how does he activate its megazord form? Edgeworth: ...I think you have a big misunderstanding. The costume doesn't actually become big. Kay: I see. So what's big is not the costume, but the misunderstanding. Hmm... I think I kinda get it now. Thanks! Edgeworth: (Does she really understand...?) Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Dirt ground Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Blaised Debeste used the tools in his garage to dig up something. Kay: There was a huge hammer in his garage too. Edgeworth: Indeed. That was probably used to break the concrete. As it turns out, these weren't Moozilla's footprints at all. Are you disappointed? Kay: A Great Thief needs to have the strength to accept the truth, no matter how hard it is. I must become stronger. Much, much stronger! Edgeworth: (...I guess she couldn't handle the truth.) Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Di-Jun Huang (after zooming) Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(Th-This is...!)\" Anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's nothing of interest here. Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Edgeworth: (Th-This is...!) Kay: What's the matter? I wanna see too! ...Hm? Eeeeeeeeeek! Lang: Hey! What's wrong!? Show it to me! Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth! I request you submit the evidence to the court! Edgeworth: ...Please take a look at the top right corner of the zoomed-in video. Lang: Th-This... This person is...! ...th-the presideeeeeent! Gravelle: Impossible! Shaun: Huh!? N-No way! Lang: It seems we've finally found it at last. The evidence that points to the true killer...! Edgeworth: (This video places Shaun at a major disadvantage...!) Shaun: Y-You're wrong! That's not right! I didn't know anything about this! Lang: That's not gonna cut it. It's clear that you and the victim were together at the same place where his body was later found! Shaun Fenn! There's no doubt. You killed the president! Gravelle: N-No! This can't be...! Why, why would you...? Shaun... please don't tell me... Did you really kill the president? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Is this really decisive evidence...? Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. Looks like even you can't object to this. Edgeworth: (Ngh...!) Lang: That pup said he didn't know anything, right? And yet, the president's right here in the video! Shaun: ........ Edgeworth: Shaun! What are you hiding? Gravelle: Shaun...! Please tell us the truth! Shaun: .......... The truth is... The truth is... It's all my fault... Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! What did you do!? Shaun: M-M-Moozilla's head falling was all my fault! -- During the Rehearsal -- Shaun: While I was setting up the equipment on the roof, I used the heater... After that, I went down to practice, but I forgot to turn it off. Then my mom called me, so I left the film lot. When I came back to the lot, after the phone call was over... Moozilla's head that was on the roof had fallen... And right next to it was the president, lying dead on the ground... Gravelle: H-How can that be...? Edgeworth: I see. There were indeed traces that something had caught fire on the rooftop. Shaun: ..It was just a small fire, so I was able to put it out by myself. Kay: So... the president's death was Shaun's fault? Gumshoe: But, wouldn't that make this an accident, sir? Edgeworth: ...And then, what did you do with the fallen head? Shaun: I took it apart, brought the pieces up to the roof, and put it back together. Lang: Lang: So, you put out the fire, and even put the fallen head back on the roof. Which means you were hiding evidence... We can't be having that, you naughty little pup. Shaun: I didn't do it on purpose! I really did just forget to turn off the heater... Edgeworth: When the legs broke, the stand would have tilted. If Moozilla's head was on top of the stand... Kay: ...it would've fallen off! So, the head fell down because of the fire! Edgeworth: Yes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness. Lang: Lang: ...Was it really just an accident? If that's the truth, then what was the president doing here? Shaun: I-I don't know! There was no one else around when I was there! Lang: You expect me to believe that!? The president wouldn't have just come to a place like this without a reason, you know! Edgeworth: (Indeed, the president's reason for coming here is still a huge mystery... Two nights ago, he met with Judge Gravelle on the roof of the Grand Tower... ...and last night, he was here at the film lot. Did he meet with Shaun...? I'll have to listen to Shaun's testimony very carefully...!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. You are still young. I know it can get a little cold in early spring, but you shouldn't have to resort to a heater... Gravelle: Gravelle: It is precisely because he is young that he must make sure to take good care of himself! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: However, while it can get a bit chilly during this time of year, I wouldn't necessarily say... Shaun: Hold it, old man. Is this really the right time to be having this argument? Edgeworth: G..... Gah! (He's completely right.) Gravelle: Shaun. You did well to get the better of Mr. Edgeworth, but please mind your language. Edgeworth: (Let's not forget that he got the better of you too, Your Honor...) Shaun: I-I know, Mom... So, umm... where was I? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You forgot to turn off the heater? You didn't check it before leaving the roof? Shaun: I meant to turn it off, but I was too focused on practicing, so... And come on, everyone forgets stuff like that sometimes! Kay: Yeah, I gotcha! I forget small things like that all the time too! Like sometimes, I'll forget to turn off the AC or the lights in Mr. Edgeworth's office... ...or I'll jump off the ladder for his bookshelves, or leave prank calls on his answering machine. But forgetting to turn off the heater is really dangerous, so you've gotta be careful! Edgeworth: (Some of those things had nothing to do with forgetfulness...) Shaun. Please continue. Shaun: Looks like you've got it rough too, old man. Well, back to my story... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It was late at night at the film lot... and not a single member of the film crew was around. So then, why did you have to leave the premises in order to answer the phone call? Shaun: I totally forgot about the phone call thing... so I kinda panicked. If I didn't answer it fast, I would have been busted for leaving the hotel without permission. Edgeworth: In that case, why didn't you just answer it here? Shaun: B-Because I was rehearsing, all the cameras and mics were on. If I talked here, every last word I said to Mom would've been caught on camera! Edgeworth: (So he was embarrassed that the conversation with his mother would be recorded.) Shaun: Anyways, I stopped practicing for a bit and rushed out of the film lot. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that phone call, you lied and said you were at the hotel, correct? Kay: Why didn't you tell your mom that you were rehearsing? Shaun: If I told her that, she would've called the hotel and made them send me a taxi or something. Gravelle: Gravelle: Of course I would have! A child alone on the streets at the time of night... What sort of parent would allow their child to be in such a dangerous situation!? Edgeworth: Hmm. I guess kids just don't understand how their parents feel. Kay: It goes both ways, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Now then, Shaun. Please tell us about what happened after the phone call. Shaun: Huh? O-Oh yeah. Of course. When the call was finished and I came back here... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was there any indication that the head was about to fall? Shaun: ...I-I don't know. I was focused on my rehearsal. Edgeworth: So you forgot to turn off the heater, which led to a fire on the roof. I would think you should have at least heard something. Shaun: Heard something...? Oh, I was wearing headphones, so... Edgeworth: Headphones? Shaun: Listening to the movie's soundtrack helps me get into the scene... I had it on full blast. That's why I didn't hear anything. Edgeworth: And yet, you noticed your mother's incoming call? Shaun: I had my phone on vibrate, old man. That's how I noticed. Anyways, the head had fallen... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What was the state of the body? Shaun: ...I didn't get a good look. 'Cause it was dark. ........ Edgeworth: (Hm? He's suddenly become as quiet as a mouse.) Kay: I guess Shaun doesn't really want to remember anything about the body... Edgeworth: (...Is that the only reason why he's gone so quiet? Should I press him for more details?) Press him further Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Leave him be Edgeworth: (It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.) Edgeworth: You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead? Shaun: ! Th-That's... well... Edgeworth: (He's clearly shaken. ...He must be hiding something.) Wouldn't you normally call for help if you see someone collapsed on the ground? However, you did nothing of the sort... Shaun: But... But he...! He was already dead... Edgeworth: Is that so? You seem quite certain that the president was already dead... Now, is there a reason for that, I wonder? Shaun: The guy was collapsed on the ground, and right next to him was the fallen monster's head. I'm not stupid. It wasn't hard to imagine what happened... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You can imagine whatever you want, but there was no way for you to know that he was dead! You actually checked to make sure the president was dead, didn't you? Shaun: Urk.....! Y-Yeah... that's right! I was scared... but I got up close to the body and checked to see if he was breathing. Edgeworth: (I thought as much... However, why would he hide that? There must be a reason...) ...Please tell me the state of the body at that time. Shaun: A-At first, I didn't know he was dead... I would've realized sooner if there had been any blood... ...but there wasn't a single drop, and his clothes were completely spotless. Either way, he wasn't breathing. That's how I knew he was already dead... Edgeworth: ...Would you please append those statements to your testimony? Add statements: \"I didn't know right away that he was dead. There was no blood, and his clothes were spotless.\" and \"But he wasn't breathing at all when I checked, so I knew he was already dead.\" Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Edgeworth: (It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you knew immediately that it was the president? Shaun: Not right away. It was dark, so I had to get a bit closer. But... I knew his face because we worked together briefly, after all. Kay: Y-You worked with the president!? Wow, Shaun...! When did you do that!? Edgeworth: Have you already forgotten, Kay? The president had a cameo in this movie. Kay: Ah! That's right! Of course... N-Now I remember! Edgeworth: Good for you. So, Shaun. You confirmed he was dead? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were unable to tell if he was dead because of the lack of stains on his clothes... Are you certain of that? Shaun: Of course I am. You guys saw the body too, right? So what's the big ideal!? Edgeworth: You said that the area was dark. And yet, you were still able to make that observation? Shaun: I'm telling you, there wasn't a single stain on his entire body! Give it a rest, old man! Edgeworth: Heh... Thank you, Shaun. That was all I needed to hear. Kay: Are clean clothes that important to you, Mr. Edgeworth? Mine are freshly washed though! Edgeworth: Next... could you tell me how you determined that the president was dead? Shaun: Well, there wasn't anything to let me know right away that he was dead, you see... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did you check if he had stopped breathing? Shaun: They taught us how at school. You get right up close to the person's nose... ...and check to see if you can feel their breath. I never thought I'd have to do it for real, though... Kay: That was really brave of you, to be able to do something like that. Shaun, you sure are amazing for an elementary school kid. Edgeworth: Kay, he's in middle school. Please try to get that into your head sometime soon... Kay: It'd be pretty scary to see a corpse just suddenly appear out of the blue like that... Not to mention the fallen monster head lying next to the body. Edgeworth: Panic would certainly be an understandable response to such a situation. Kay: But still, all things considered... This was just an accident, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. That is, if we decide to take Shaun's words at face value... (I wouldn't mind having some more concrete details on the state of the crime scene...)-- Kanis's Savior -- Kanis: Certainly, it was I who killed President Huang. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You admitted that rather easily. Kanis: These days, I have long grown tired of killing. ...Keh heh heh. But in those halcyon days, I devoted myself to the path of an executioner. If one cannot admit that much, what can he admit? Right, Anubis? Yes, yes, my boy. Kay: I feel like he's saying something scary, but it's kind of hard to understand him! Edgeworth: This fallen priest is saying he has no feelings about the president's death. (Kanis, the assassin and escaped prisoner. He should be a despicable opponent, but... ...silencing him now would be imprudent. I must keep my composure and let him talk!) I understand your point. ...You killed the president. Kanis: That is correct. The aim of my blade never misses its mark. Kanis: However, my life was also targeted on that day. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your life was targeted? You, the assassin? Kay: The hunter becomes the hunted. The Buddhist becomes the Buddha. Edgeworth: Kay, you don't have to make up strange proverbs. Kanis: ...Life is transient. Especially for an assassin, whose life is always exposed to danger. Kay: So, does that mean people you've tried to kill have fought back? Kanis: That is a rare occurrence... However, this was different. Kanis: The body double, Blaise, and Fifi all sought to seal my lips. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Bodhidharma Kanis. You are a master assassin. As such, could you not have evaded an attack from those three and fled the scene...? Kanis: Keh heh heh. You greatly overestimate me. Without Anubis by my side, I would not even be able to walk about. If those three were to attack me all at once, I would not stand a chance. Edgeworth: I see. So even an assassin will fall to superior numbers in a frontal assault. Kanis: I suppose one could say that. I, Bodhidharma Kanis, would have suffered a shameful defeat. Kanis: Had I not been reunited with the young acolyte back then, I would have been in danger. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Reunited...? So, when did you first meet with him? Kanis: That would be 18 years ago, on the 24th of December. Edgeworth: (That is a rather long time ago...) Kanis: On that day, our roles were reversed. I saved the young one's life. There was an unusual snowstorm on that day. The temperature was well below freezing. I took Anubis for a walk in the snow. That's when Anubis noticed something and started running. I followed after him and found a car. I had great difficulty opening the door. It had frozen shut. In the back seat... there were two young children, shivering from the cold. Edgeworth: Two children? Kanis: Had they remained in the car for an hour longer, they surely would have frozen to death. I brought the two of them to a nearby orphanage... Edgeworth: (Is there anything about Kanis's story that concerns me?) There is something Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Leave him be Edgeworth: (I don't think there's anything in particular that stands out...) Kanis, please continue your testimony. Edgeworth: (What concerns me is...) The date Leads to: \"The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that?\" The number of children Edgeworth: There were two children in the car... you're sure of that? Kanis: It may have been 18 years ago, but I remember it clearly. There were two children in the car, there is no mistaking it. Does the good prosecutor have a problem with that number? Edgeworth: (Right now, the number of children isn't what I have a problem with.) Kanis: Are we done talking about this subject yet? Leads back to: \"(What concerns me is...)\" The model of the car Edgeworth: What was the model of the car the children were in? Kanis: The model of the car? What would you want to know that for? It was a typical mid-size car, the kind you see everywhere. Other than the freezing children sitting inside, there was nothing unusual about it. Edgeworth: (...Looks like the car model is of no real importance.) Kanis: Are we done talking about this subject yet? Leads back to: \"(What concerns me is...)\" Edgeworth: The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that? Kanis: There is no mistake. Ray: C-Could that mean...!? Edgeworth: (I know... the significance behind that date.) What shows the significance of the date when Kanis found the children? Present IS-7 Incident Documents Edgeworth: Leads to: \"That day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence is connected to that date, isn't it? Kay: Ummm... How exactly is it connected? Kanis: I don't know what the good prosecutor brought out... ...but I can sense that there is no real connection behind it. Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (Kanis saw through it.) Kay: Mr. Kanis found the children on December 24th! Let's try looking at the evidence again with that date in mind! Leads back to: \"(I know... the significance behind that date.)\" Kanis: But alas, even to this day, I do not know what has become of the young acolyte... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And now you're searching for the boy from all those years ago? Surely, you're not saying you want to thank him for saving you? Kanis: Keh heh heh... Well, who knows. However, the young one did save my life. That is the truth. Even Anubis took a liking to him. He would do tricks for him, such as \"shake\" or \"roll over\". Kay: I thought that the tricks Kanis taught his dog were a little bit different from the norm, though. Kanis: You are right about that. For Anubis, \"roll over\" means first biting the victim's foot... Kay: Stop! Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear any more! Kanis: Keh heh heh... There is no need to worry, I only showed the young one ordinary tricks. Edgeworth: (...Hmm. I get the feeling that Kanis, in his own way, felt indebted to the boy.) Kay: Mr. Kanis and that \"acolyte\" seem to share a complicated relationship, huh. Edgeworth: Perhaps there is a hint to the mastermind's motive hidden somewhere in his testimony. Kanis is one of the few people who knows the mastermind first hand... Let's try to draw out as much information as possible from him. Edgeworth: That day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered. Kay: Ah! Edgeworth: During that incident, two young boys went missing. The sons of the victim, Isaac Dover, and the culprit, Dane Gustavia... Ray: We never did find out where those two boys went after the case 18 years ago... Kanis: Oh? They were the sons of a victim and a culprit? It all makes sense now. Edgeworth: What makes sense? Kanis: One of the youths was bound, so that he could not move. Kay: Mr. Dover did it so that Mr. Gustavia's son couldn't come to the contest venue. Edgeworth: Indeed. Gustavia was using his own son as a taste tester. Kanis: Keh heh heh heh. To think that was what transpired. Neither child seemed to recall what had happened. Edgeworth: They lost their memories? Kanis: The acolyte told me this when we were reunited 12 years ago. The pair were placed in an extreme situation, on the verge of freezing to death... That trauma led them both to suffer from amnesia. Neither could so much as remember his own name. Kay: So they didn't even know that they were the sons of Mr. Dover and Mr. Gustavia. Edgeworth: Indeed, while we cannot say it conclusively, the probability is quite high. (However, we still don't have enough information to deduce the mastermind's identity...) Kanis... Would you please continue your story? Kanis: Keh heh. Very well. -- Kanis and the \"Acolyte\" -- Kanis: I continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison. Recently, that has all come to an abrupt halt, however. It left me quite concerned. Furthermore, those involved in the crime 12 years ago were all drawn into incidents one by one. I grew more and more curious. And so I absconded briefly from the prison. Edgeworth: Those involved 12 years ago... ...were Fifi Laguarde, Blaise Debeste, and President Huang's body double. Kay: And Ms. Laguarde was the warden of Mr. Kanis's prison. Kanis: Keh heh heh. I blackmailed the warden. That woman had tried to kill me. Perhaps the good prosecutor has already deduced the reason? Edgeworth: You murdered President Huang... However, the world still believed he was alive. If you were able to prove the president was a fake... ...both Fifi Laguarde and Blaise Debeste would have been in danger. Kanis: That is correct. And I had heard the proof with my own ears. I'll be waiting in the courtyard of the orphanage at midnight on February 9th. Even if it's just once, I want Shaun to be able to meet you. I'm sorry if I'm being selfish, but... I'll be waiting. Huang: ...Who might you be? My apologies, but I am presently waiting for someone... Kanis: Keh heh heh. I am well aware of that... President Huang. Are you not meeting with your son? However, I do not spill blood needlessly. You may relax. I seek only the president's life. Huang: .........It can't be. P-Please wait. I am just about to meet my son for the first time. I'm sure this will be the first and the last time. Please, at least wait until we are finished... Kanis: I had thought the president would beg for his life, but he was of a different sort. Officially, the president had no son. However, he shook his head and said... ...this illegitimate son was his, and he intended to recognize him publicly. Furthermore, he claimed that he had already made preparations towards that end... Would that son of his be the boy with horns over there by any chance? Kay: Boy... with the horns? Wait, you can see Shaun's horns? Kanis: Keh heh heh. There is no need to see them. From the moment I escaped from prison until now... ...I have been closely lending an ear to your voices. Edgeworth: (He said that the president made \"preparations\" towards recognizing his son... ...but the word \"preparations\" alone would be insufficient for blackmail.) ........That's it! Lang: There was one thing that could prove Huang's words: the will held by the House of Lang. It was also proof of his trust in us. His son's existence would've been revealed to the world. Kanis: The name on the recording, the mention of preparations, and the will in Zheng Fa... Keh heh heh. Together, they sufficed to make the Warden bow to my words. Edgeworth: (With those three pieces of information, one could prove the identity of the double... ...by using Shaun!) Shaun: .......... Kanis: The president blocked the first strike of my knife with something soft. As pieces of it fell atop the snow, I struck once more. This time, the blow proved fatal. Edgeworth: (So Kanis cut off the Moozilla doll's horn...) Kanis: None but I heard his final words. Only myself and that child knew of the president's secret son. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In other words, you contacted him from prison? Kanis: Keh heh heh. That is correct. A post-office box was used. Kay: A post-office box...? Edgeworth: It would allow one to send and receive letters without revealing the recipient's location. Kanis: I could not use a form of correspondence that would reveal the acolyte's location. ...There was someone keeping watch over my correspondences, after all. Edgeworth: (He must mean the prison warden... Fifi Laguarde.) Could you be more specific about the nature of your correspondences? Kanis: Well. They were mainly moves from my correspondence chess matches. Kay: C-Correspondence chess? If I recall, the person you were playing against... Edgeworth: This might be hard to believe... but Kanis's chess opponent was... Kay: Ah! Are you saying he was playing against Mr. Knightley? Wasn't it Horace Knightley? Edgeworth: We certainly found the correspondence chess memo in Knightley's cell. Correspondence Chess Memo jotted down in my Organizer. Ray: Does that mean... Knightley-boy was the kid from the IS-7 Incident? Edgeworth: (Could... that really be true? Is there any evidence connecting Knightley to the IS-7 Incident?) Present Knightley's Mementos Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence. Ray: What about it? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think it has anything to do with the incident at all, though. Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (Perhaps I should think it over one more time?) Ray: Why don't you look over Knightley-boy's belongings one more time? Something related to the IS-7 Incident just might pop out! Edgeworth: (Knightley's belongings, huh? Let's look over them one more time...) Edgeworth: (This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within? Which should I investigate? The ring or the chessboard...?) The ring Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" The chessboard Edgeworth: (Obviously, we should investigate the chessboard.) Ray: Huh? Miles, what are you doing taking out the chessboard? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think the chessboard has anything to do with the IS-7 Incident. Edgeworth: Argh! (He may be right... In that case, the only piece of evidence left to investigate is...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: This ring is...! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, what is it? Edgeworth: Mr. Shields, please take a look at this ring! Ray: Th-This pattern is... It's Pierre Hoquet's! Edgeworth: I thought so... He had Mr. Dover's seal turned into a ring. However, why would he have this? Shouldn't it have been held by the police as evidence from the IS-7 Incident? Ray: After the incident, the seal was returned to the victim's next-of-kin. And Mr. Dover's only family was his son. But since no one knew where the son had gone to, it took a while to get it to him. I'd heard that the police had finally found him and delivered his inheritance, but... Edgeworth: ...So the seal was thereby safely delivered to his son. And then, he turned the seal into a ring and wore it on his person. Knightley's Mementos data updated in my Organizer. Kay: So... Mr. Knightley was Mr. Dover's son... Ray: The police aren't fools. I'm sure they did a thorough check before handing over the seal. Kay: If someone involved in the IS-7 Incident was his chess opponent... Lang: Knightley, huh. Then that man must be the mastermind behind this case! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But, Knightley is dead! He cannot be involved in this incident. Ray: How about that. The only one who could be the mastermind was himself a murder victim...? Kay: But a dead guy can't be the culprit! So there's no way that's right! Edgeworth: (It certainly is strange... In that case, who is the culprit?) Add statement: \"Writing letters in braille can be a rather enjoyable pastime.\" Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence. Ray: What about it? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think it has anything to do with the incident at all, though. Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (Perhaps I should think it over one more time?) Ray: Why don't you look over Knightley-boy's belongings one more time? Something related to the IS-7 Incident just might pop out! Edgeworth: (Knightley's belongings, huh? Let's look over them one more time...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: (Obviously, we should investigate the chessboard.) Ray: Huh? Miles, what are you doing taking out the chessboard? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think the chessboard has anything to do with the IS-7 Incident. Edgeworth: Argh! (He may be right... In that case, the only piece of evidence left to investigate is...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That was your means of playing correspondence chess. You used chess notation for your moves. Kanis: Keh heh heh... as expected, the good prosecutor has done a thorough investigation. Kay: His chess opponent was Horace Knightley, right? Edgeworth: The ring Knightley wore... Mr. Shields, please have a close look at it. Ray: Yeah, there's no mistake. This is the evidence from the IS-7 Incident. The police found Mr. Dover's son and returned it to him. If you're saying that the son was Knightley, then... ...the acolyte, who was Kanis's chess opponent and the mastermind, was Knightley? Edgeworth: No, Knightley has already been murdered. He cannot be at the center of the incident. There is no doubt that the mastermind is still hiding somewhere out there. Kay: ...Well then, Mr. Kanis. Sorry to have kept you waiting. Kanis: Hmm... that was a rather interesting tale. Wasn't it, Anubis? I shall continue my story about the acolyte. Our longstanding chess match continued... Edgeworth: (It seems she's not much good with the assassin's dog.) Kanis: Good boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It came to a halt? Now, of all times? Kanis: Quite odd, is it not? Anubis told me again and again how odd it was. Kay: That scary dog talked? Was he like, \"Something's odd, woof!\"? Kanis: Keh heh heh. I can understand Anubis's heart, even if he does not voice his thoughts. Kay: Umm... Then, there's something I'd like to ask, just in case. Your scary dog's staring at me right now... He's not saying, \"I'm hungry. I want some meat\", right? Kanis: Keh heh heh... Perhaps. Kay: P... Perhaps... Aaaaah... M-Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (It seems she's not much good with the assassin's dog.) Kanis: Good boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That certainly does seem too much for a mere coincidence. The body double of Di-Jun Huang, the president of Zheng Fa faked an assassination plot. Fifi Laguarde, the prison warden, murdered Horace Knightley. And Blaise Debeste, the Chairman of the P.I.C, murdered Jill Crane. (Come to think of it, as I have been investigating these cases... ...I have felt the presence of some force behind the scenes.) Kanis: Keh heh heh. Even within the prison, I could tell that this was no insignificant event. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You absconded briefly from prison? I cannot forgive such a criminal act! Kay: You stole your way out of prison? I cannot forgive such a thieving act! Kanis: Keh heh heh... Relax. No one was hurt. I merely have connections that allow me to set foot outside. Gumshoe: B-But even so, you can't just escape from prison, pal! Arrest him! Arrest him! Kanis: That won't be necessary. Once my business is done, I shall return to my cell. Lang: ...You trying to make fools of us? A prison isn't the kind of place you can just enter and leave at will! Kanis: Keh heh heh. The Wolf may say that... ...but one can see that the Wolf and his pack also share an interest in the tales of my past. Lang: Tch...! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, Detective Gumshoe. There are still a few things I must ask Kanis. Please postpone matters until then. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I knew you'd say that, Mr. Edgeworth! Lang: Dammit all... But I'm not taking my eye off you for a second! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Excuse me, but you wrote your letters in braille? Kanis: Indeed. For I possess the tools necessary to write in braille. Kay: Wow. So you need to use tools to write in braille. I never knew. Edgeworth: Then, would you please tell us what you wrote? Kanis: Everything. Letters, of course, and also the movements of the chess pieces. Edgeworth: (He wrote the movements of the chess pieces by hand? That statement is... intriguing.) Kay: So then, how does your handmade dog piece move? Edgeworth: Kay, that question can wait. So then... what did you do when the letters stopped coming? Kanis: Keh heh heh... Within the prison, I grew increasingly concerned about the acolyte's whereabouts. Kay: OK, OK... Umm... But even so, I don't really get it. Who exactly is this \"acolyte\"? Edgeworth: Indeed. Kanis himself has not yet made that clear. (What's important is the thread connecting Kanis and this \"acolyte\": their correspondence. And not just the letters. We should pay attention to the means that was used as well.)-- Kanis and the \"Acolyte\" -- Kanis: I continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison.

You wrote your letters in braille.\" Kay: OK, OK... Umm... But even so, I don't really get it. Who exactly is this \"acolyte\"? Edgeworth: Indeed. Kanis himself has not yet made that clear. (What's important is the thread connecting Kanis and this \"acolyte\": their correspondence. And not just the letters. We should pay attention to the means that was used as well.) Edgeworth: I'm certain you said... You wrote your letters in braille. Kanis: Correct. The good prosecutor must know that I am lacking in sight, do you not? Edgeworth: The correspondence chess letter we found had been typed out using a word processor. Kanis: What? That... cannot be. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Kay: So, someone went of their way to retype the letters on a computer? Edgeworth: Could another person have acted as a middleman between Kanis and Knightley? Kay: What do you mean? Edgeworth: Kanis wrote his letters in braille. However... ...by the time it reached Knightley, it had been rewritten on a word processor. ...We must assume that some middleman rewrote those letters. Ray: And the reverse can also be said. That same somebody might've taken the letters Knightley wrote and redelivered them to Kanis. Edgeworth: Yes, that is indeed true. Correspondence Chess Memo updated in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Knightley and Kanis both communicated through a certain individual... Kanis, were the letters that reached you... Kanis: They were in braille, of course. Ray: So Knightley-boy's letters must have been transposed by that same person as well. Kanis: Oh...? Then that somebody must be... Edgeworth: ...the mastermind behind the case. Lang: Lang: You're saying there's someone else who's the mastermind behind this case!? Then who the hell is it!? Edgeworth: Dover's son, Knightley, is already deceased. In that case, there is one more youth that we should consider to be the mastermind. Lang: You mean, Dane Gustavia's son...? But, who the heck is he? Edgeworth: (If Knightley is Dover's son, then Gustavia's son must be...) ???: Well, we're the only friends either of us has had since childhood... He was... the same as me. We never had real families. Edgeworth: (It can't be... could it? Could it really be him?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, what is it? You've gone all pale! Edgeworth: I've figured it out... ...The identity of the mastermind who's been controlling this case from the shadows! Kay: Whaaaat!? Who in the world is it!? Edgeworth: I don't want to believe it myself... but it is someone we know quite well. The mastermind is...! Present Simeon Saint profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\" Present anyone else Edgeworth: Kay: Whaaat!? That person is the mastermind!? But, according to what we've been saying, something seems kinda wrong... Edgeworth: ...Naturally. This person has no relation to the mastermind, after all. Kay: Are they related or not!? Please take this more seriously! Edgeworth: Argh! (I have to think carefully... Knightley is Dover's son. In that case, Gustavia's son is...) Regina: Mr. Knightley was his only childhood friend. Edgeworth: (It must be this person!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Who is the mastermind behind this case? Leads back to: \"The mastermind is...!\" Edgeworth: (The mastermind behind this case... ...sent a letter to Jill Crane, which deceived Blaise. Furthermore, he kidnapped Shaun and eavesdropped on us. However, of all his actions, the one I have not been able to get out of my mind... ...is how he brought an unconscious Kay to the roof.) ...............The Giant Monster. Kay: Huh? ...Did you just say something? Edgeworth: (That's right. The key to exposing the mastermind... is in the monster's true form.) Simeon: Ah... I-I almost forgot! Um, if you'd like... Please come to our next show! I-I'll also... be performing in it. Regina: The Berry Big Circus is always fabulous and fun for all ages! Edgeworth: Ms. Swift, there is something I would like to ask of you. Nicole: Wh-What! Ya mean me? Edgeworth: You said that you recorded the sound of Moozilla spewing flames. Edgeworth: ...Would this decisive evidence of yours be something you recorded on that tape recorder? Nicole: That's Mr. Edgeworth for ya! Yer good at figurin' things out, aren't ya!? It's the sound of Moozilla spewin' out fire. This place nearly became a sea of flames! Nicole: That's right. I ain't actually seen it with my own eyes, though... Edgeworth: Could you let us listen to the tape? Nicole: Sure thing. ...There we go! Edgeworth: (This sound, it's as I thought...! So, it seems that my reasoning was correct. The true nature of the monster and the mastermind... all of my logic is coming together!) Ms. Hart! You said that you captured a giant eye on film, did you not? Lotta: Sure did, right here in this photo. Edgeworth: (Though we cannot confirm it like this...) Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Lend us your film analysis device! Gumshoe: OK, but... What do you want to analyze, sir? Edgeworth: This photo, please! Gumshoe: I'm on it! Edgeworth: (Is there a new clue in this photo?) Present giant eyeball (after zooming) Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Th-This is...!\" Present Jill Crane Edgeworth: Kay: I can't really tell since the person is wearing a raincoat... ...but, this should be Ms. Crane before she died, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. She was Mr. Cameron's love interest. He was murdered 12 years ago. Kay: And she was murdered while investigating the mysteries of that past case... I'm sure she must've been very sad and frustrated by all that happened... We're... gonna finish what Ms. Crane set out to do! Right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Indeed. That was my intention all along. Just leave it to me. Leads back to: \"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)\" Present ladder Edgeworth: Kay: Ah! It's a ladder! We climbed up this ladder earlier, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, we did. (...Countless times since yesterday.) Kay: Take a look at this ladder... It's not bad, per se, but you can see how the gap between the steps is a little too wide. And these handrails would be way easier to grasp if they were just a bit more rounded. And also, the steps don't fell quite right when you're climbing on them for some reason. Hmm. I don't want to be too critical, so I'll give it around... 198 points! Edgeworth: (...Out of what?) Leads back to: \"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's nothing unusual about this area. Leads back to: \"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)\" Gumshoe: Th-This is...! Lotta: See!? Ain't the Moozilla's eye right where I said it would be!? Edgeworth: Heh... I see. I have finally grasped... ...the true form of the giant monster that was being controlled by the mastermind! Lotta: .......G Nicole: .....G-G Gumshoe: ...G-G-G Kay: Giant Monster!? Lotta: A-Are ya admittin' it? You are, ain't ya!? Yer admittin' that the Mighty Moozilla is real! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: No... This is not Moozilla. This is the eye of a different monster. Please have a look at this. Kay: It's a flyer for the Berry Big Circus...? Aah! Th-This is...! Edgeworth: Precisely. There is a rather large balloon with the head of a lion pictured here. This balloon is the true identity of the Giant Monster! In addition, the sound Ms. Swift recorded, which she believes to be Moozilla spewing flames... Nicole: Mr. Prosecutor... don't tell me, yer gonna say somethin' that'll shatter my dreams of a scoop... Gumshoe: Hot air balloons fly by using burners to hear the air, right, sir? Edgeworth: Precisely, Detective. The mastermind used this monster of his... ...to bring Kay to the rooftop of the Grand Tower without using the elevator! Kay: Wouldn't that mean... that the mastermind is someone connected to the circus? Ray: He's a member of the circus, Knightley's friend, and... Dane Gustavia's son. Wh... Who'd have thunk it...!? Edgeworth: An apprentice beast tamer? Heh..... He's no amateur. For the beast he has tamed is none other than this entire case! Simeon Saint! He is the mastermind behind this whole incident! Kay: M-Mr. Saint... was really behind it all...? N-No way...! I don't believe it! I mean, we trusted him! How could it all have been a lie!? That's just... heartbreaking... Edgeworth: Kay..... Edgeworth: Hm...? What is it? Shaun: Hey, you! Stop! Where do you think you're going!? Kanis: Keh heh heh heh... The boy with horns is rather perceptive. ...The good prosecutor has done a remarkable job. Now that I have heard that, I have no further business here. Edgeworth: What... Wait! Kanis! Grrr... *ruff, ruff!* Lang: Dammit! Where'd he vanish to!? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Are you OK!? Edgeworth: Yes, I'm fine. However... Shaun: .....That guy...! Edgeworth: ...Shaun? Shaun: That Kanis guy... he's the one who killed my dad, right? Edgeworth: (There is no question more difficult to answer. However...) There's no use in denying the truth. Yes, Shaun... You are correct. Shaun: He'll pay for this... I swear he's gonna pay...! I... I'll make him pay myse... Gravelle: Gravelle: Shaun! You mustn't finish that thought! ...Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please pay us no mind. Edgeworth: ...... Gumshoe: Sir! I've put out an APB on Kanis! All available police units will be searching for him! Lang: ...You heard the man, kid. I don't mean to be heartless, but we need to hurry, too. So Mr. Prosecutor, where's the mastermind right now? Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang is right. Our top priority right now should be catching the mastermind. He said he would be practicing. He is most likely at the Berry Big Circus tent. But first... Agent Lang, I have a request. Lang: A request...? What is it? Edgeworth: Now that we've identified the Giant Monster, our next order of business... is to capture it. The moment we arrive at the tent, I need you to locate that specific item posthaste. And Detective, I ask that you perform a follow-up investigation on the kidnapping incident. Gumshoe: Roger that, sir! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth. I wanna help out too! Edgeworth: Hmm. In that case, you'll be in charge of calling for backup. If he is truly the mastermind, we may require assistance from a certain someone... (I met him so many times, yet his facade always fooled me into sympathy. He may have got the better of me in the past... but this time, I'll settle it once and for all!) To be continued. April 6, 5:30 PMBerry Big CircusStorage Tent Regina: Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Simeon: Are you guys here for the show? Edgeworth: Mr. Saint... Ms. Berry... Simeon: You're a little early... I'm sorry, but we're still getting ready... But, I'm so happy you came! You remembered our promise! Edgeworth: Yes, I remembered... You asked us to come and see the show when you gave me this. Simeon: ...I'm so happy you came! Please enjoy yourselves! I'm sure my performance will surprise you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Your \"performance\" has already surprised me, Mr. Saint. Simeon: .......... Regina: Umm. But he hasn't performed yet... Edgeworth: Regina. Please have a look at this photo. Is this balloon the property of the Berry Big Circus? Regina: Ah! I-It is! Did you see it flying around somewhere? Edgeworth: It's highly likely that this balloon was used by the culprit in the case we are investigating. Regina: Huh!? Edgeworth: Who is in charge of the balloon? Regina: Well, th-that would be S-Simeon, but... A-Are you saying...!? Simeon: ......... Edgeworth: Mr. Saint. You flew this balloon in the middle of the night. Did you not? Simeon: ...I do occasionally practice alone at night. I'm not much of a pilot though. I'm... a little clumsy. Edgeworth: Heh. So for practice, you'll do something as challenging as flying a balloon at night? Wouldn't that be rather difficult for someone who is clumsy and \"not much of a pilot\"? Simeon: Then... what do you think I was doing, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: You brought Kay to the roof of the Grand Tower... ...in order to frame her for the murder of Jill Crane! Not a single security camera recorded Kay using the elevator. Therefore, the only way she could have gotten up there was through flight. And the only one who could have flown her up there... was you, Mr. Saint. Simeon: No way... Mr. Edgeworth, how can you say that? Edgeworth: That's not all. You drugged Shaun at the garbage pickup, and kidnapped him. Wasn't that why you were late when you came to watch the trial of Fifi Laguarde? Simeon: No way... I have no idea what you're saying. There's no way I could do things like that. Please believe me... Mr. Edgeworth, please! Edgeworth: I wanted to believe you. However... you have broken that trust yourself! Simeon: Th... That's horrible. Why would you say that? Didn't you once say that you would trust me? That you'd believe in me? Kay: Don't you worry about that. We're your allies! That's because... we're like birds of a feather! Right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (Birds of a feather, huh? ...I suppose that's true.) We have sufficient information about your past. I doubt you had a motive to kill Knightley. Rather, you are probably the most affected by his death. And I doubt someone as timid as you could work up the courage to murder someone. Alright. I'll get you out of here. ...We'll believe in you. Simeon: I'm so sad... Those words were all lies... Kay: I-It wasn't a lie! We really did trust you...! Simeon: Kay, even you? You said we were like birds of a feather, and yet... I'm hurt, Kay. You've hurt me deeply... Kay: I-I-I... oooooh... Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Maybe Simeon isn't a bad guy after all... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I see. So that's how you operate. I understand now, all too well. No matter who you face, you find an emotional weakness and exploit it. You guide each person towards the outcome you desire, without them even noticing it. That... is how you were able to mastermind the entire case! Simeon: ........ Edgeworth: I may have fallen for your tricks before... but, not this time. Simeon Saint. I indict you! Simeon: ...........Hmm. So, it's come to this after all. You were always so full of confidence, Mr. Edgeworth. But, I rather like that. Because now... I can rip that confidence to shreds. Hah... Good work, everyone. Edgeworth: (Ngh..... His personality has completely changed!) So, the animal tamer who could not tame animals... That was all a facade. This is the real Simeon Saint. Regina: S-Simeon! That's not... true, is it!? Simeon: Truth or lie... What difference does it make? Regina: Huh!? Simeon: Mr. Edgeworth's just made me a little upset, that's all. Keh heh heh heh. ...You'll take responsibility for upsetting me, right? -- Balloon Practice -- Simeon: It's true. I practiced with the balloon two nights ago. That photo must have been taken when the balloon and I passed near the building. I often fly around that area for advertising purposes. There's nothing unusual about that, right? Edgeworth: You often fly around the Grand Tower in the balloon? Simeon: Yeah. Even the circus needs to advertise. Edgeworth: Regina, is that true? Regina: Y-Yup. It was Simeon's job to advertise using the balloon. Most people who live around here should have seen it. Edgeworth: That balloon was used in the crime we were investigating. Simeon: Like I said, it's just a coincidence. I simply happened to pass by the Grand Tower when that photo was taken. Edgeworth: I shall determine whether or not it was a coincidence after I hear your full story. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the balloon launched from this tent? Simeon: There's a nice, big park near the Sunshine Coliseum. I always launch the balloon there. Edgeworth: I see. In that case, how do you transport the balloon to the park? Simeon: Well, it's too heavy to carry by hand. It weighs several hundred pounds. And yet, it can fly in the sky... Amazing, isn't it? Edgeworth: I asked you how you transported it. Now answer the question. Simeon: Aww, I can't even make some small talk...? You're mean, Mr. Edgeworth. I used a truck. The balloon is loaded onto the back of the truck. Edgeworth: A truck...? Simeon: Yeah. The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago. Edgeworth: (Hmm. I cannot overlook that piece of testimony...!) Add statement: \"The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Allow me to confirm... You haven't driven the truck since then? Simeon: Do you really need to confirm that? I mean, I just said it five seconds ago. Edgeworth: Answer the question. Or would it be inconvenient for you to do so? Simeon: Ha ha. That's a pretty weak provocation, coming from you, Mr. Edgeworth! What could be inconvenient about something I've already said? Fine, I get it... That truck has been parked behind the dressing rooms since two days ago. And the balloon and basket are still inside. Is there a problem? Edgeworth: There's no problem. I simply wanted to express my thanks for that piece of testimony. (So the truck was parked here for the past two days... Heh! That was exactly what I wanted to hear, Mr. Saint!) Simeon: ...May I continue? So then, regarding the balloon... }} Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You're saying it was simply a coincidence that you were photographed near the tower? Simeon: Ah, I get it. I know how you operate now, Mr. Edgeworth. You'll insist that a coincidence is impossible until you get your way. When you say it like that, everything will inevitably go your way! How scary! Kay: Ugh! You're wrong! Mr. Edgeworth isn't like that... Edgeworth: Kay, calm down. He's only trying to provoke an emotional response. He intends to goad us into losing our focus, in order to derail the topic at hand. ...Now, why do you think he would do that? Kay: Umm, because he's a clown...? No, I mean, because he's trying to hide something, I guess? Edgeworth: Exactly, Kay. We must not let up on him. However, we must continue to keep our composure... Understand? Kay: Yep! So, Simeon. Allow me, as the assistant, to ask you a question! When you passed by the Grand Tower at that precise moment, was it really just a coincidence? Simeon: ...We could've just left things at that. But... ...for the sake of your assistant, I shall explain my reason for being there. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, in addition to advertising with the balloon, maintaining the balloon is also your job. Am I wrong? Simeon: You're a real stickler for the details, y'know. Yeah, that's right. Ask the boss if you want. ...Right, Boss? Regina: Yup. Simeon is in charge of cleaning and fixing and all that stuff with the balloon. I don't think anyone besides Simeon has used the balloon for a while now. Edgeworth: (...Hmm. That confirms he was the one riding the balloon in the photo taken two days ago. However, if he is the mastermind, he must have used it today as well. Am I able to prove that?) Simeon: Looks like you're deep in thought... Is it really that hard to comprehend? Hot air balloons fly in the sky. And in other news, the sky is blue and the grass is green. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I wonder about that. You flew the balloon in the middle of the night, eerily close to a certain other incident... Would you say there's nothing strange about that, as well? Simeon: Mr. Edgeworth, isn't that like a really leading question? Won't you please stop being such a naughty prosecutor? It's kind of downer. It's a clown's job to put smiles on people's faces, after all. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He ducks and weaves around my questions skillfully. Very well. In that case, I will simply have to make use of a more direct attack!) Edgeworth: (We still don't know much about the balloon. In any case, I must draw out more information...)-- Balloon Practice -- Simeon: It's true. I practiced with the balloon two nights ago. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the balloon launched from this tent? Simeon: There's a nice, big park near the Sunshine Coliseum. I always launch the balloon there. Edgeworth: I see.

If that truck just so happened to be yours... ...then your claims that you last used it two days ago becomes a lie. Simeon: ........ Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Ema! Ema: Mr. Edgeworth! I've finally found you! I've been searching for you ever since the incident yesterday! I dashed right over after Kay contacted me just a little while ago! Lang: Prosecutor Edgeworth. The thing you were looking for. I've found it. It was placed in a blue truck at the dressing room parking lot. Lion Balloon data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: A blue truck... as I suspected. That truck is, without a doubt, the one I saw today. Simeon: Simeon: There are a number of blue trucks out there, you know? Who's to say you're not mistaking it for a different one? Kay: It's definitely that one! I got a good look at it! Edgeworth?: Kay: Huh? Mr. Edgeworth, was that...? Edgeworth: I-It wasn't me...! Simeon: \"Kay. Words have no strength without evidence to back them up.\" Kay: Ah! That's Mr. Edgeworth's voice! Simeon: \"Evidence! Present evidence!\" Edgeworth: (Do I have any evidence... ...to prove that this was the truck I saw today?) Kay: Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck? Edgeworth: The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time. Kay: You can figure all that out just by touching it!? Edgeworth: What could prove that this is the truck I saw...? Looking for bloodstains Edgeworth: I'd like to check to see if there are any bloodstains left on the truck. Simeon: Bloodstains? What's the point of looking for bloodstains? Even if there's a luminol reaction, it's not like it will prove anything, right? Kay: I don't really see a point in looking for bloodstains either, Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (I'd better come up with something else.) Simeon: It's not like our brilliant prosecutor to spout out such nonsense. As I thought, there isn't any evidence at all, is there? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Is there really no evidence? Edgeworth: (If this truck is the same as the one I saw today...) Kay: Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck? Edgeworth: The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time. Kay: You can figure all that out just by touching it!? Edgeworth: (Then there must have been something left in the truck!) Leads back to: \"What could prove that this is the truck I saw...?\" Dusting for fingerprints Leads to: \"I'd like to dust the truck for fingerprints.\" Using a metal detector Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe! Please let me use your metal detector. Kay: .......... Gummy isn't here! Didn't you ask him to investigate something else for you!? Edgeworth: Ack! (I'd completely forgotten...) Simeon: Using a metal detector on a truck, you sure say some funny things. The whole truck is made of metal. Of course you would get a reaction! Edgeworth: Mmph! (I'll have to think of some other way...) Simeon: It's not like our brilliant prosecutor to spout out such nonsense. As I thought, there isn't any evidence at all, is there? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Is there really no evidence? Edgeworth: (If this truck is the same as the one I saw today...) Kay: Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck? Edgeworth: The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time. Kay: You can figure all that out just by touching it!? Edgeworth: (Then there must have been something left in the truck!) Leads back to: \"What could prove that this is the truck I saw...?\" Edgeworth: I'd like to dust the truck for fingerprints. Simeon: Eh!? Fingerprints? What for? I don't see any point in that! Edgeworth: A certain person's fingerprints should be left on this truck. And these fingerprints will prove this truck was parked in front of the Grand Tower today! (Whose fingerprints prove this truck was in front of the tower?) Miles' fingerprints Leads to: \"Edgeworth...? Your fingerprints?\" Simeon's fingerprints Simeon: My fingerprints? Wouldn't they be all over the truck anyways? After all, I'm the one who drives the truck! Finding my fingerprints on it doesn't prove a thing! Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (I guess he has a point...) Kay: We're looking for whoever left fingerprints on the truck in front of the tower, right? In that case, there's only one person it could be! Edgeworth: Indeed. It's obvious who must have touched it. Leads back to: \"(Whose fingerprints prove this truck was in front of the tower?)\" Lotta's fingerprints Lotta: Eh!? Yer sayin' they're MY fingerprints...!? Edgeworth: Indeed. We should be able to find your fingerprints on the truck. You touched the truck when it was in front of the tower, did you not? Lotta: I hate to break it to ya, but... ...I... don't reckon I ever touched that truck at all. Edgeworth: Argh! (It seems I was mistaken...) Kay: We're looking for whoever left fingerprints on the truck in front of the tower, right? In that case, there's only one person it could be! Edgeworth: Indeed. It's obvious who must have touched it. Leads back to: \"(Whose fingerprints prove this truck was in front of the tower?)\" Simeon: Edgeworth...? Your fingerprints? Edgeworth: Indeed. Earlier today, I touched a truck at the plaza in front of the Grand Tower. I'd like to dust for my prints. Ema, might I request a scientific investigation? Ema: That's what I'm here for! Just leave it to me! Alright, we're all set! Go ahead, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Wait... You want me to do it? Ema: Of course. Who else but Mr. Edgeworth would be up to the task? Here, I'll show you how it's done! Edgeworth: Umm... Alright, then. (You're the scientist, why don't you just do it yourself...?) Ema: First, we sprinkle some aluminum powder over the area you want to investigate. Like this. Edgeworth: (Touch the screen to sprinkle the aluminum powder.) Ema: The powder will adhere to the fingerprints, so once you've sprinkled enough... ...you blow it away! Edgeworth: Blow it away? Ema: Yeah, just blow on it, with your breath. Fwooosh. Edgeworth: (Blow the powder away by blowing into the microphone.) Ema: Got it? Edgeworth: Yes, I think so. (I guess we'll do it for real this time...) Ema: Just so you know, the key point is to sprinkle the powder all over. Obtain fingerprint Leads to: \"We got one! That's a nice, clean fingerprint!\" Ema: We got one! That's a nice, clean fingerprint! Edgeworth: Let's run the prints against mine posthaste. Ema: Alright! Just leave it to me! These are definitely your fingerprints, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Well, it seems to me that we have just proven your statement to be a lie. Simeon: Ugh! Lang: What were you doing when you were driving this truck around? Simeon: Just... taking it for a joyride? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Kay was abducted two nights ago. Your balloon was sighted not far from the scene. Today, there was another kidnapping, in which a garbage truck was used... ...and once again, your truck was seen nearby. Simeon: Simeon: This all sounds like nothing more than a pure coincidence to me... Edgeworth: So it was pure coincidence that you parked near two separate kidnappings? I doubt that. You were involved in both kidnappings, weren't you? Simeon: Isn't it a bit rash to automatically assume that the two kidnappings were connected? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And what if I had evidence to prove that the two crimes were performed by the same culprit? Simeon: Oh! You're serious!? I can't wait to hear this! Edgeworth: What did Kay and Shaun's kidnappings have in common? Present Sleeping Drugs Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Kay was knocked out with a powerful sleeping drug.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence shows that the same culprit was behind both kidnappings! Simeon: Oh? And just what part of that evidence shows that, exactly? Edgeworth: Hmm. I'd say... around here? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Try to sound a bit more confident, will ya!? Simeon: Gyahahaha! You don't actually have a clue what you're talking about, do you? Edgeworth: ...Ugh! (He saw through me...) Kay: If the same culprit was behind both kidnapping cases, he must have used the same method... Let's look at the evidence related to the kidnappings again! Edgeworth: Right. Perhaps then all will become clear. Simeon: What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Run out of evidence? Edgeworth: No. I have evidence, and I can prove that the culprit in both kidnappings was the same! Leads back to: \"What did Kay and Shaun's kidnappings have in common?\" Edgeworth: Kay was knocked out with a powerful sleeping drug. And a bottle of sleeping drugs was found lying in the place where Shaun was confined. The contents of the bottle were a match with the drugs used on Kay. Simeon: Simeon: ......So that's all you've got, huh? And here I was, getting my hopes up. So the same sleeping drugs were used. So what? You think that connects the two incidents? Surely, you must realize it yourself? That doesn't prove a thing. Edgeworth: Ngh...! (Th-There must be something... Evidence that proves he is connected to those cases...!) Simeon: The police, prosecutors, and even you, Mr. Edgeworth. In the end, you're all the same. You make up evidence as you see fit, just so you can send some poor soul to prison. Isn't there someone like that here? A poor soul who was wrongly accused in the past? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You're wrong! Wh... Who would do such a thing!? Simeon: Simeon: Then show me the evidence! If you're going to accuse me of a crime, it's only natural! Edgeworth: (Ngh......... It's no use. I can't seem to find any other threads linking him to the kidnappings...!) Simeon: Now then. Have you finally run out of ammo, Mr. Edgeworth? I still have preparations to make at the circus, so if you'll excuse me... Ray: Ray: Now, now, you two... No need to get so heated. And Simeon... You're looking good in that clown makeup! Simeon: H-Hey, what's your deal!? Don't just butt in like that... Ray: Uncle Ray's not so good in such a stiff environment. I mean, why so serious, right? Hey, Kay! How about a little trick? Kay: At last, my moment has arrived! The Great Kay Faraday presents... a Simeon impression! \"O-Objectiooon...!\" Simeon: Wha... Wh-Why you! Enough already! Ray: ...Psst. Hey, Miles. I'm buying you some time to get all your ducks in a row. There's probably a better way to stall for time than this, but whatevs. Woo! Nice one, Kay! Edgeworth: (I'm not so sure about this method, either... ...but I have to find something that connects Simeon to the case... And I need to find it now! Is there evidence not related to the kidnapping that's connected to the mastermind's identity? That's it...! The mastermind is the same person as the young acolyte Kanis was looking for. If I can just connect the young acolyte to Simeon... Which piece of evidence could be connected with the mastermind's true identity...?) Present Correspondence Chess Memo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Knightley and Kanis both communicated through a certain individual...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I've found it...! This is the evidence that connects you to the case! Simeon: Really, now? That's interesting. Well then, show me how it's connected! Edgeworth: Hmph... Leave it to me. If you hold it like this, and turn it this way... Kay: \"Too baaad! Epic fall, Mr. Edgewooorth!\" Edgeworth: Gwooooh! (Wh-Whose side are you on, anyways...? Something... I have to find something! It simply must exist! Evidence that shows the mastermind is connected to those involved in this case...!) Leads back to: \"(Which piece of evidence could be connected with the mastermind's true identity...?)\" Edgeworth: Knightley and Kanis both communicated through a certain individual... Kanis: Oh...? Then that somebody must be... Edgeworth: ...the mastermind behind the case. Edgeworth: (That's it... The mastermind played a role in the correspondence chess... If I can prove that it was Simeon, then...!) Simeon: That's enough. I can't stomach any more of your sorry excuse for a performance. If you have no more objections, then I ask that you let me get back to preparing for the show. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Thank you for the help, Mr. Shields. (Though you may have taken it a little too far...) Ray: You sure look happy. I take it you've found something? Kay: \"Look at me! I'm Zimon! Zimon ze Klown...! Ze funny, funny klown!\" Edgeworth: Kay, you can stop now. Now then... Mr. Saint. Do you happen to like chess? Simeon: Hmph. That was rather out-of-the-blue. But since you asked, I can't say that I dislike chess. Edgeworth: The mastermind played correspondence chess with Bodhidharma Kanis. Simeon: Simeon: If I recall, it was Knightley who had been playing chess with Kanis, wasn't it? Are you saying that he was the mastermind? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There was no way Knightley could have been the mastermind. The reason being... ...the mastermind had continued to work behind the scenes even after Knightley's death. That being the case, who could have written this letter? I believe someone acted as the middleman between Kanis and Knightley. Simeon: So, you're saying that you think I'm the middleman? Ha ha ha! And just why would I have to go to all that trouble and do something like that? Edgeworth: Most likely, to make it appear as if there was a connection between Knightley and Kanis. And, as a result... Knightley was killed by Fifi Laguarde. Kay: N-No way! Are you saying it was all set up so that he would be killed by her!? Simeon: Simeon: What are you saying!? There's no way I could manipulate a person that far! Look at me! It takes all I have just to get the animals to perform tricks! Edgeworth: (If only just a scrap of the letters he exchanged with Knightley still remained... ...it'd be decisive evidence!) I'd like to investigate your room. There could be decisive... Simeon: Simeon: If it's the letters you're looking for, you won't find any in there. Edgeworth: What!? Simeon: I'm the type of guy who throws his letters away as soon as he's done reading them. Where's the point in living in the past? Edgeworth: (Ngh! Does that mean he's already gotten rid of the evidence...!?) Simeon: Mr. Edgeworth... Everything you have said so far has been nothing more than baseless conjecture. Edgeworth: (The evidence... I'm just one step behind it! What should I do? Am I all out of moves...?) Simeon: Without evidence, I won't allow you to cast doubt on my friendship with Knightley! Edgeworth: Wh-Who was that? Regina: Ah! Excuse me! Edgeworth: (Ms. Berry? What's on her mind?) Regina: I've been... listening in on what you all were saying, and, umm... When you say Mr. Knightley... You mean Simeon's friend, Mr. Knightley, right? Edgeworth: Yes, that's correct... (Does she know something?) Regina: This morning, a letter arrived from Mr. Knightley. It was for Simeon. Edgeworth: What!? Simeon: What did you say...!? Edgeworth: (But that's impossible! Knightley's already dead...!) Ms. Berry! Please, let me see that letter! Regina: OK! Here you go. Kay: Quick, open it! Edgeworth: This is... a correspondence chess letter! Kay: This is the response to Kanis's last move! Knightley: Now, can you see the path to checkmate? I can't wait to see the look on your face... You weren't expecting to lose at chess against me, right? Edgeworth: The postmark says March 26th... The day before Knightley's death. It seems the letter arrived late. Regina: Since the circus moves around so much, a lot of the mail people send us arrive late. Edgeworth: Now, why was this letter addressed to you? Simeon: .....Ngh! Edgeworth: This is proof that you were the middleman between Kanis and Knightley. Normally, you would transcribe this letter into braille before sending it to Kanis. And in doing so, you created a connection between him and Knightley! Simeon: Dammiiiiiit! Curse you, Knightley! Why must you continue to interfere!? Kay: Simeon... Why!? Wasn't Knightley your only friend? Simeon: Hah! Don't be ridiculous. I stopped thinking of him as a friend 18 years ago. Edgeworth: 18 years ago...? Would that have been the day of the IS-7 Incident? Simeon: ...Thanks to Knightley, I nearly died that day in the snowstorm. While I was on my way to the contest venue, where my father was waiting... ...Knightley suddenly appeared. He held me down... tied up my hands and feet, and with tears streaming down his face... ...he kept apologizing, \"My dad's too scary, I can't disobey him. Please forgive me! I'm sorry!\" Simeon: Stop it, Horace! I promised my dad! I said I'd taste his desserts... If I'm not there, Dad will be in trouble! I'm gonna let everyone know my Dad's desserts are the best in the world...! Simeon: After that, he locked us inside a car. It was so cold, I could see my own breath. Before we knew it, the doors had frozen shut, and not even he could get them open. And then... I lost my father! Edgeworth: Wha...! Kay: Your father...! Simeon: Horace Knightley was the son of the murderer who killed my father! Edgeworth: (What could this mean? His confession runs contrary to the information we have...) Ray: But the name of the victim in the IS-7 Incident was Isaac Dover... Simeon: Isaac Dover is my father's name. 18 years ago, my memories were muddled from the shock of my near-death experience... So it wasn't until later that I learned the truth. On that day, my father was murdered. Edgeworth: ...The culprit of the IS-7 Incident was a confectioner by the name of Dane Gustavia. Simeon: Heh... So that was the name of Knightley's father. That lowlife scum of the earth killed my father. Just the thought of him makes me sick. Edgeworth: So you knew who the culprit was all along? Simeon: Hah... Of course not. Had I known, I would've tipped off the police a long time ago. All I knew was that Knightley's father was trying to set up my own father. That's why I immediately knew that the one who died that day was my dad. Knightley had a hand in my father's murder, that traitor! He was the son of a killer! It's only natural that he ended up dead! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...It would appear that you are a victim of a very serious misunderstanding. Simeon: Misunderstanding...? Just what're you talking about? Edgeworth: Isaac Dover... At the time, he was actively working as a sculptor in France... ...under the name Pierre Hoquet. Simeon: Is that right? Well, I'm sorry to say, I don't remember that at all. Edgeworth: Heh... It's only natural you don't remember. After all, he's not your real father. Simeon: ...Huh? What, is that supposed to be a joke? I am not amused. Edgeworth: Hmph... You won't be able to laugh at all, once I reveal the truth to you. This piece of evidence proves that you are not Isaac Dover's son! Present Knightley's Mementos Edgeworth: Leads to: \"What's that? Isn't that Knightley's chessboard and his ring?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Simeon: What's that supposed to tell me? Edgeworth: Can't you see? This shows that you and Dover aren't... Simeon: Simeon: Mr. Edgeworth. That doesn't prove anything. I honestly don't have a clue what you're trying to get at. Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (It seems I was wrong...) Ray: Hang in there, Miles. Who was really Mr. Dover's son...? If you keep calm and think it through, the answer should come naturally. Edgeworth: (Isaac Dover's real son...?) Simeon: Mr. Edgeworth. Stop joking around. There's no doubt that I'm Isaac Dover's son. Edgeworth: No. I'm sorry, Mr. Saint, but that's just simply not possible. Leads back to: \"This piece of evidence proves that you are not Isaac Dover's son!\" Simeon: What's that? Isn't that Knightley's chessboard and his ring? Edgeworth: I want you to take a good look at this ring's design. Simeon: ...There are two letters inscribed in it. Edgeworth: That is the seal Pierre Hoquet used as his signature. 18 years ago, it was found lying near the body of Isaac Dover. Simeon: ! Wh... Why would Knightley have my father's memento with him!? Edgeworth: The police had found Isaac Dover's son and gave it to him. Isaac Dover's real son... is Horace Knightley. Simeon: Wh... What!? B-But that means, I'm...! Edgeworth: In other words... you are Dane Gustavia's son! Simeon: That's... that's a lie! After all, I'm... My... father is.....! My memories are.....! I lost my father because Knightley locked me up in the car...! That's why, I thought it would be fitting if he were killed as well! Knightley: Really!? I'll be able to see a circus show, even in prison? Heh. I enjoy playing chess with you, but I'm looking forward to your performance as well. Simeon: ......Yes. Please look forward to it. Knightley: Alright! You better drop by again. I'll be thinking about my next move! Simeon: Oh yeah. I've left something special inside that chessboard for you. You should check it out later. Knightley: Something special? I'm not quite sure what you mean, but thanks. I owe you one, Simeon. Simeon: ......If only you hadn't stopped me 18 years ago... ...it wouldn't have had... to come to this. Knightley: Huh? Did you say something? Simeon: Nope. Not a word. ......Goodbye, Horace. Simeon: After all that...! You're saying it was my father who killed Knightley's? Then, that means... Was it all for nothing...!? I didn't want to become some weakling who could be killed by anyone... That's why... I thought I'd follow in Mr. Kanis's footsteps! Edgeworth: This finally proves it... Simeon Saint! You are Kanis's correspondence chess partner... ...and the mastermind behind this case! Simeon: ............ GYAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That's right! It was me! I'm the mastermind behind it all! Edgeworth: (He's finally showing his true colors...!) Simeon: As you all know, I witnessed the incident 12 years ago. Edgeworth: (President Huang's assassination...! So the child who drew that picture was Simeon Saint...) Simeon: When I was found out... ...I was subjected to horrible interrogations over and over by that heartless Fifi. I'd spend the nights trembling in my bed, terrified of what the next day would bring! I'm sure you can understand why I'd want to sneak out of there, right? Edgeworth: However... Blaise would have likely sent pursuers after you. Simeon: Exactly. I was on the run from them every waking moment. 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. I couldn't even sleep at night, I'd jump at the slightest noise. ...And that's why I became a circus performer. Blaise Debeste was the Chief Prosecutor, and Fifi Laguarde was the warden of the prison. No ordinary person would be a match for those two. And there were no adults I could rely on. Furthermore, behind the scenes was the body double who had set those two in motion. Though he was a fake, I was up against a nation's president... Talk about utter despair, right? My only ally was Mr. Kanis... He saved my life, after all. He actually helped me out. Unlike Knightley. Edgeworth: (If this story is true... Hmph. It's ironic. Kanis, the fiendish assassin, was idolized by the child he saved.) Simeon: If I followed in his footsteps, I'd no longer have to worry about being eaten alive. That's right. Now it's my turn... My turn to devour those who would feed upon me! Edgeworth: And I suppose you never thought to seek help from the police. Simeon: Nowaynoway! As long as Blaise was around, any evidence would be destroyed by him. Actually, didn't something like that almost happen today during Fifi's trial? I knew from the very beginning. That things would turn out like this. Edgeworth: (The evidence from Fifi Laguarde's trial... So he's saying that he expected the evidence would be destroyed...) I see. So that's why you kidnapped Shaun... ...to force a Guilty verdict, even in the absense of evidence! Simeon: Simeon: Who's to say. But, in order to expose the crimes of 12 years ago, there was no other choice. Edgeworth: That's according to you. However, Blaise also... ...attempted to kidnap Shaun in order to manipulate the trial in his favor... Your methods are no different than those of the people you so despise! Simeon: Simeon: That's only if I were actually the kidnapper. But I would never do anything so evil. Nowaynowaynoway, I just simply couldn't! Besides, Mr. Edgeworth. I'm actually quite thankful to the real criminals... ...for giving me the opportunity to extract such sweet revenge! Ke he heh... Gyahahahahahaha! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you admit it. Your motive was revenge. Simeon: Yeah, I admit it. So what? Sure, I held a grudge against those creeps. But... it's not like I'm the one who actually killed them, ya know? Edgeworth: .....! Simeon: Truth be told, all I did was send some letters. I let Jill in on Blaise's secrets, and let Blaise in on Jill's secrets. And then, the two simply ended up trying to kill each other. Gravelle: Do you mean to say the murder was nothing more than a result of that!? Simeon: Yep! Just like the case at Gourd Lake. It's way easier than trying to control wild animals. All I did was come up with the fake assassination plan for Knightley. Edgeworth: (So that was also a part of his plan...!) If that's the case, then Rooke's murder was also your... Simeon: Simeon: Whoa! Don't try to pin that on me. Knightley killed him all on his own. Well, it ended up creating the perfect opportunity for me... It's funny how things work out! Kay: How can you say such a thing...!? Simeon: It was the same for Fifi Laguarde. I made it look like there was a connection between Knightley and Kanis... ...by using the correspondence chess match and the chisel in the chessboard. Edgeworth: What!? You mean to say that you were the one who prepared that chisel!? Simeon: That's right! I thought it would bring Kanis to mind. Quite a thoughtful little gift, wouldn't you agree? And that was all it took to get Fifi to murder Knightley! Oh, the feeling that everyone around you is an enemy. Heh heh. I know it all too well. The tiniest spark can set off an explosion of fear, resulting in... horrific mutual destruction. All I did was watch the comedy of errors unfold from the audience. And you were my final pawn, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: A pawn... Me...? Simeon: When you solved their cases, you brought both Blaise and Fifi to their run... ...and the weapon that delivered the coup de grâce was your own logic! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I didn't solve those cases for your sake! Simeon: Oh, I know. You never really cared about saving me. You just wanted to pretend to be a defense attorney, didn't you? Edgeworth: What did you...!? Simeon: All I had to do was go, \"nowaynowaynoway\" and act all scared... ...and you totally believed me. You were giving it your all trying to save me. Edgeworth: Ngh...! So even your arrest was just a ploy to make me use my logic...? Simeon: To be fair, getting arrested wasn't part of the plan. When people began to suspect that the chisel I sent was the murder weapon... ...honestly, I broke out in a cold sweat. I thought for sure it would be curtains for me. But then, a turnabout of miraculous proportions! The genius prosecutor himself had come to my rescue! Well? Doesn't it feel nice to be thanked by me, the one that you saved? You should be grateful! I gave you this chance to play the ace attorney! Kay: You're wrong! He wasn't pretending to be a defense attorney! Mr. Edgeworth is always serious about saving people...! Even the times when he saved me in the past...! Edgeworth: (Kay...!) Simeon: Gyahahahahahaha! Is that so? Are you sure he's not just trying to emulate his own father, the one he admires SO much!? Kay: Absolutely not! That's not true at all! Ray: Now, now, Kay. The person he's talking about now isn't Miles, but rather, Simeon himself. Clearly, he is not able to trust others. The desire to save someone other than himself is something he cannot even comprehend... Simeon: Say what you want. But make sure you think about it long and hard. Sure, all my targets for revenge got what they deserved in the end. However... -- Instigating Murder? -- Simeon: Think about it. Can any one of my actions really be considered a crime? I instigated murder? There's not a single word about that in the letter, is there? If I had said the word \"kill\" even once, I guess it could be considered instigation. Well, maybe I did say it. But there's no way for you to prove it. Kay: What are you saying!? You kidnapped me! Simeon: I'm sorry, but that hasn't been proven yet, has it? The only thing I admitted to was sending the letters. Kay: That's...! Simeon: Besides, those letters contained no threats or coercions. I simply conveyed information. Information that each recipient would find beneficial. Edgeworth: Ngh... (You crafty little...!) Kay: Can't we do something about it? Umm... what was it he said? Integrating murder? Edgeworth: Instigating murder is when a person directs someone else to commit murder. The person who directed the murder can be charged as if he committed the crime himself. Kay: So we just have to find proof that he directed those murders! Simeon: You make it sound so easy... To be honest, it kinda pisses me off a little. You're all trying to frame an innocent person for murder. Don't you understand? I'm not obligated to waste any more time on this pointless discussion. Lang: Lang: The police are waiting for you outside of this tent! You have nowhere to run! Simeon: Really now? You think I wouldn't have an escape route prepared? For example, let's say... ...I gave an order so that all the animals here attacked you! Now, what if I were to take my leave during the ensuing chaos? Lang: What'd you say!? You... can't be serious... Simeon: Gyahahahaha! It was just an example! Wouldn't that make for an interesting show? Here's another idea: what if I pulled out a hidden gun and took Shaun hostage? Mmm. That might be more exciting! Gravelle: I-I will never allow you to do such a thing! Edgeworth: (I can't tell whether or not Simeon is being serious... ...however, when it comes to him, we should consider anything a possibility!) Simeon: If you continue to bore with your drivel, I'll end the show right here. I'd like you to keep that in mind before you make any baseless objections! Edgeworth: (Ngh...! I cannot make any careless remarks...! Isn't there some way I can charge him with his crimes?) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You incited others to commit murder, and they did so. If proof of that was established, you would be charged as if you yourself committed the murders. Kay: ...Umm, I know I heard it just a while ago, but what's the technical term again? Edgeworth: It's \"instigating murder\", Kay. Blaise, Fifi Laguarde, and Knightley... Their crimes are unforgivable, of course. However, the one who pulled the strings from behind the scenes, and drove them all to murder... ...was none other than you, Simeon Saint! Simeon: Aha, aha, gyahahahahah! Mr. Edgeworth, you really do speak your mind freely. But you know... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's not... a single word? Simeon: Oh, does that surprise you? You'd reach the same conclusion if you examined it. Edgeworth: (Hmm. Given his composure... I'd say he's not bluffing. Does this mean that every single word in his letters had been carefully calculated...!?) Simeon: Well, I guess you could say this is like teaching a monkey to climb a tree. Unless you can somehow prove that I caused those murders, you've got nothing on me. ...Ergo, you can't assume me of instigating murder. Heh heh heh... What a shame, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I know you instigated the murder! ???: Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane. Edgeworth: What!? Edgeworth: You told me yourself. Simeon: Simeon: But you know, the funny thing is, it means absolutely nothing if you have no proof. I mean, there's no way I'd ever say something like that. Nowaynowaynoway! Edgeworth: (Ngh... that's certainly true. It means absolutely nothing if I can't prove it. If there was some evidence that could prove what he said over the phone...) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Maybe you did say it\"? Did you or didn't you!? Simeon: Gyahahahah! It doesn't really matter whether I did or didn't! That's not what's important. I'm sure you know full well, Mr. Edgeworth. There's no way to prove it. There's no way any proof could exist! Edgeworth: Ngh...! (Until I find some sort of proof, my arguments are meaningless. Should I press him to draw out more information, or review the evidence...? At any rate, I must find some way to break through his defense!) Kay: Is Simeon really innocent of instigating the murders? Edgeworth: That's impossible. I'm certain that it was all part of his murder plot. Kay: Yeah. Edgeworth: We know he had the will to commit the crimes... We just need some way to prove it... Edgeworth: (He confessed to me over the phone. He told me he had Blaise kill Mrs. Crane... If only there was some evidence that could prove what he said over the phone...\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Kay Faraday\nDescription: A self-styled Great Thief and so-called \"second Yatagarasu\" who's always looking to bag the greatest treasure of all -- the truth.\nCharacter 1\nName: Lotta Hart\nDescription: A freelance photojournalist who I've met in the past.

I reckon... yer through bein' a prosecutor, right? Edgeworth: Yes... that's true, I suppose. (I'm no longer a prosecutor. However...) Kay: You can't stop thinking about what Mr. de Killer said, right? Edgeworth: Indeed... de Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Edgeworth: (This case isn't over yet... The person in the red hood who kidnapped Kay at Gourd Lake... And this letter from an unknown sender. Someone's schemes are at work behind this case...) Lotta: Must be tough havin' a case you just solved still naggin' at the back of yer mind. Well, I got some investigatin' of my own to be doin', so I'll be off! Kay: That's amazing! You've already decided on your next scoop? Lotta: What're ya sayin' there, missy!? Don't you be underestimatin' the likes of Lotta Hart! I've covered a lotta scoops, ya know? I always have an extra scoop or two up my sleeves... ???: S-Someone! Help! Kay: Yikes! What's that!? ???: S-Someone! P-Please help! Edgeworth: (Hmm. This woman is...) What's happened!? ???: S-Somebody's dead! A m-monster...! Edgeworth: (A... monster?) Lotta: I-It's a scoop! A scoop's callin' me! ???: Please follow me! It's this way! Kay: Has something else happened? Again!? Edgeworth: I don't know... At any rate, we should follow her for now. Kay: Eh!? These are...!? Lotta: G-Genuine hoofprints! Edgeworth: (Hoofprints? Impossible! No animal could be this large...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Look! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang...! Why is he here?) Kay: Ah! Someone's on the ground! Edgeworth: (It can't be... The president of Zheng Fa... Di-Jun Huang!) Lang: ........ Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Lang: ......Mr. Prosecutor. Didn't take you long to get here. Edgeworth: What happened? Lang: What... happened? Ha! That's what I'd like to know! Edgeworth: (It would seem that he's in a considerable amount of shock over the president's death. However... ...what exactly are these giant footprints...? And what could have happened to the president?) Lotta: It's a m... m... monster! Edgeworth: A... monster? Lotta: Yessiree! Lookie here! Ain't no doubt about it, these are clearly the footprints of a monster! On this day, mankind received a grim reminder: we live in fear of the Mighty Moozilla! Edgeworth: (Mighty... Moozilla...?) Lotta: This here's a scoop! I got myself a scoop! \"Man Trampled to Death by Monster!\" I reckon it'll be the top story in tomorrow's paper! Edgeworth: (What nonsense... There are no such things as monsters... Wait, it can't be...?) Huang: I am Di-Jun Huang. I have heard of your deeds. You saved my country from a great crisis. Edgeworth: The real assassin was you all along...! de Killer: That is correct. I received a request from a key individual... ...to take the president's life... Edgeworth: (That man... could he have...?) Lang: Hey, you! Were you the first to discover the body? ???: Y-Yes, I...! Umm, well. Edgeworth: (! Agent Lang?) Lang: Lang Zi says: \"First come, first suspected.\" You! Did you really just discover the body!? ???: O-O-O-O-O-Of course! Kay: Please calm down! You're scaring her! Edgeworth: (He does seem to have lost his composure...) Lang: Tch. Calm down!? How am I supposed to calm down? Do you know who's been murdered!? Di-Jun Huang... the president of Zheng Fa! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. This isn't like you. Lang: ! Edgeworth: When we first met, you had an army of subordinates under your command... ...and you boasted of having the highest arrest rate in Interpol. And what now? Did you forget the fundamentals of investigation along with all of your men? Lang: What... did you say...? Edgeworth: Instead of questioning people at random, you should investigate the crime scene first. Am I wrong? Lang: ........Tch! I don't need you to tell me that. ...I'll do a thorough investigation. Edgeworth: (Well. At least it seems he's calmed for now...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Let's investigate too! Edgeworth: Yes. Let us investigate. (Right now, I do not have any investigation rights, but until the police arrive...) Lotta: What're y'all sayin'? Ain't it obvious who dunnit!? The man behind it all is the Mighty Moozilla! Hm? Well, I guess it ain't the \"man\" behind it, more like the \"monster\" behind it, ya know? Edgeworth: Good grief... Could you please just try not to interfere with the investigation? Lotta: Shut yer trap! Yer the one who better not be stickin' yer nose in my business! I ain't forgivin' ya if ya mess up my scoop! ???: Umm... Excuse me. Edgeworth: (Hmm. It's the woman who first discovered the body. I feel like I've seen her before...) ???: You're... Mr. Edgeworth, right? Do you remember me? Edgeworth: Umm. Y-Yes. That case... from before... Kay: Huh? Do you know her? Edgeworth: Yes, I do. (At least I think I do...) Kay: My name's Kay Faraday! I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! Penny: My. You have such a cute assistant? I'm Penny Nichols. I'm an assistant at Global Studios. I'm in charge of the props and sets. It's nice to meet you. Edgeworth: (Yes, that was it... I once handled a case that occurred during the filming of the Steel Samurai. This woman was a member of the show's staff, and she was involved in the incident. I must have met with her on numerous occasions over the course of the case... ...but to be honest, I had completely forgotten about her...) It's nice to see you again. The fact that you are here must mean that this place is... Penny: Yes! This is sort of an outdoor film lot for Global Studios. They're shooting a movie here right now. I was the first to arrive today, to set everything up for the filming... ...but everything seemed strange... Those giant footprints... and that... d-dead body... Edgeworth: I see. We shall examine the body. At any rate, could you please contact the police? Penny: Y-Yes! Right away! Edgeworth: (I'll have to take the time to listen to her story later... First, let's examine the scene. There are many things besides the body that concern me. I'll need to examine every nook and cranny of this place...) (Connecting \"Stepped on by a monster?\" and \"Monster's head\" Logic leads to:) Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. I'm going to take my leave here for a bit. There's something I have to check... Edgeworth: (Agent Lang. I wonder if he's caught onto something?) Hm? ???: ........ ........ Lang: ........ ???: .....Move it. Lang: What'd you say? Guess you're just a brat with no manners. ???: ...And you're an annoying old man. Quit your yapping already. Lang: ! Penny: I-I'm terribly sorry! Come on, Shaun! Lang: Tch! Penny: Oh! What were you doing!? ???: .......Who was that? Penny: Someone from the police! Why'd you suddenly pick a fight with him? ???: Hmph. Kay: That sure was a tense standoff! Edgeworth: (He didn't budge an inch, even before Agent Lang...) Penny: Ah! Allow me to introduce you! This is Shaun Fenn. He's the lead actor in our movie. Edgeworth: (The lead actor... is this child?) Kay: Hi! I'm Kay Faraday. Nice to meet you! Edgeworth: And this is Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth. Shaun: .......Prosecutor? Penny: He's a pretty famous prosecutor, you know. Shaun: But he's not wearing a prosecutor's badge. Edgeworth: Gah! (He's frightfully perceptive...) Penny: Ah! Shaun, it's probably better if you didn't go over there... Shaun: ............ Edgeworth: (That's certainly not a sight a child should see... However, he is someone involved with the case. I'll need to speak with him later.) (Connecting all possible Logic, examining ground around the body, original Moozilla model and table, clearing all \"Talk\" options of Penny and Shaun, and talking with Lotta leads to:) Edgeworth: And with that, this portion of the investigation seems to be finished. Kay: So the murder weapon really is... Edgeworth: Yes. As it stands now, the possibility that it was the monster head is quite high. Kay: So he ended up being squashed by the falling head, huh... Edgeworth: Hm? Lang: Although they're extremely late to the party, the bodyguards and the police have finally arrived. Bodyguard: Mr. President! Lang: They really were... far too late. Bodyguard: Damn it! Who did this!? Lang: ...They'll pay for this. I swear I'll make them pay. But you know, this much is enough to put me at ease. The person who did this to Huang... ...I've already got my eye on a suspect. Edgeworth: What? What do you mean? Lang: Even though Huang was the victim, he doesn't have extraterritorial rights here. Your country's police have the right to investigate. However, I've already spoken with them. As an agent of Interpol, they're letting me assist in the investigation... Edgeworth: ...So they've already established a plan for this investigation? Lang: I've already found my prey. Now it's time for the hunt... ...Take a look at this. It's a printout from a security camera on the Grand Tower rooftop. Edgeworth: Th... This is! Lang: This camera records people as they get off the rooftop elevator. And guess who was recorded? The president and his killer can be clearly seen! Kay: Wh-Why is Ms. Gravelle there!? Edgeworth: (So he's saying Judge Gravelle is the murder?) Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste! Edgeworth: (Could she, who hates crime more than anyone, have...?) Security Camera Photo jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. I'd like to hear your thoughts. Lang: Lang: ............ Just now, I heard a rumor at the Grand Tower. Miles Edgeworth, that you... are no longer a \"prosecutor\". Edgeworth: ! Lang: Naturally, that means you don't even have a shred of investigate authority. So what would be the point of having a logic battle with someone like you? Edgeworth: (Hmph...!) Kay: Why would you say something like that!? Didn't you also just get reduced to being a lone agent!? Lang: .......... Hey. Answer me this. Even though you've lost your position as a \"prosecutor\"... ...why are you sticking your neck into this case? Edgeworth: ........ (Why do I still continue to investigate...?) Agent Lang... Why are you pursuing the criminal who murdered the president? Because you're an Interpol agent? Lang: .......... Edgeworth: Right now, I am also chasing after a certain person. Someone in the shadows, who was behind the murder at the Grand Tower yesterday... Someone who placed Kay in grave danger. ...Even now, they are lurking somewhere, laughing at us. We will uncover the truth, and bring them to justice... ...and a title such as \"prosecutor\" has nothing to do with it. As long as the truth remains hidden... ...I will continue to seek out that truth. For that is a part of my creed. Lang: ........Haha! You... You're always trying to be so clever, but you really are kind of an idiot. Edgeworth: (Hmph. Me, an idiot? How rude...) Lang: That's the answer I wanted to hear. ...Alright, I'll play along with you for a bit. I've lost all my men, and you've lost your title. And yet, we still continue to investigate... Let's begin this battle of logic between two kindred spirits! Edgeworth: You have my thanks... Lang: However, I won't go easy on you. I'll definitely catch the criminal who murdered Huang. And I won't let you get in my way! Edgeworth: Yes... I wouldn't have it any other way! Lang: Let me show you the truth that this wolf has sunk his fangs into! Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower. Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president! Edgeworth: It was just the two of them alone on the rooftop... No bodyguards? Lang: Yeah. I confirmed it with those bodyguards over there. They didn't know about it either. Guess he managed to give them the slip. He must've had something secret to talk about. Edgeworth: (President Huang and Judge Gravelle... Did those two have some sort of connection?) Lang: Apparently, he had an arrangement with the owner of the Grand Tower. He requested the entrance to the viewing platform be restricted so that they could be alone. Well, it's not like the owner could turn down a request from the president. Kay: Does that mean... the last person to see the president was... Lang: Exactly... Gravelle, you mean? It's gotta be her! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang's reasoning is certainly sound... However, he has overlooked one major thing...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Lang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower. Lang: Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. Lang: At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. Lang: There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president! Edgeworth: (Agent Lang has overlooked something major...! ...and that's where I must strike!) Edgeworth: Shi-Long Lang... For the Interpol agent with the highest arrest rate to have fallen so low. Lang: What'd you say...!? Edgeworth: This is a commemorative photo taken by the staff at Global Studios. Kay: Everyone's got such great smiles! ...Well, except for Shaun. Edgeworth: This photo was taken yesterday. Lang: What!? Edgeworth: If Judge Gravelle had murdered the president two days ago... ...then his body should have been there when this photo was taken! Lang: Owwoooooooh! Lang: Heh. Perhaps you should have listened a bit more carefully to those involved in the case. Questioning witnesses is one of the basic fundamentals of an investigation, is it not? Kay: I've captured Mr. Edgeworth's great smile! You really do look most alive when you're cornering your opponent! Lang: Grr... Just as I expected. It's been a while since I've felt like this. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, haven't you been a little hasty in your reasoning? Lang: ........Tch. I don't need your advice. Lang Zi says: \"The wrath of a wolf lasts a hundred years.\" My anger towards the woman who killed the president cannot be suppressed. Edgeworth: I, too, wish to capture the culprit. However... ...there is no doubt that the body appeared here last night. Therefore... the president could not have fallen to his death. Kay: Yeah! He was crushed by the monster head! Edgeworth: The crime occurred here at the film lot, not on the rooftop of the Grand Tower. Lang: Lang: So, that's what you think. Still, I don't intend to stray from my logic either. Edgeworth: However, he could not have fallen to his death two nights ago. This photo proves that... Lang: Is that so? Think about it this way... Two nights ago, Gravelle pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body. Edgeworth: In here? Lang: Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Once we search this area, we'll know where she hid the body. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Unfortunately, there is no need for a search. Lang: What'd you say!? Edgeworth: This piece of evidence proves that Judge Gravelle could not have hidden the body! Edgeworth: All the entrances to the film lot were locked. The chain on the back entrance was only cut last night. Lang: What!? Edgeworth: Therefore, Judge Gravelle could not have entered the film lot two nights ago! Lang: Aiyaaaaa! But the president could only have fallen two nights ago! Edgeworth: ...Why are you so insistent that the crime occurred two days ago? Lang: Why...? Because there's still more to the security camera footage. Lang: A photo was recorded 10–20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman. That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone. After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all! There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there? Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is! Edgeworth: The president never came down from the rooftop? Lang: That's right. The security camera is always watching the entrance of the elevator. It was specifically set up to record anyone who entered or exited the rooftop. Essentially, the camera created a locked room... one which the president vanished from! Edgeworth: (A locked room... I see. This is quite an unfavorable piece of evidence for Judge Gravelle...) Security Camera Photo data updated in my Organizer. Kay: A rooftop escape! That's a difficult feat! Edgeworth: So even the Yatagarasu can't just fly through the sky. Kay: That's right. I... I still need more training to be able to pull that off. Edgeworth: (Are you saying you're going to train yourself to fly?) Lang: A photo was recorded 10–20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman. Lang: That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone. Lang: After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all! Lang: There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there? Lang: Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is! Edgeworth: (A locked room created by the security camera... Is falling off the roof really the only way to escape this locked room?) Edgeworth: As a matter of fact, there was one. A hidden route... that is. Lang: A way down without using the elevator!? You'd better not tell me he flew off or something! Edgeworth: There's no need for that. It's quite simple. The president just needed to know... ...about the existence of the hidden 51st floor. Lang: The 51st floor? Edgeworth: This building has a hidden 51st floor. It is accessible through a secret hatch on the rooftop. Using that route, it would be possible to leave the rooftop without using the elevator. Lang: Lang: Hidden room? Secret hatch? How could the president have even known about that? Edgeworth: I wonder? I don't know the answer myself. I am merely raising a possibility. Lang: In the first place, what's this all about? This hidden 51st floor. Sounds like something that ninja girl over there would love to get into! Kay: No way! I'm sick of that place! Edgeworth: (For Kay, that place only holds bad memories, after all.) The 51st floor was a secret storeroom for the black market auction. Its true purpose was only exposed yesterday. Lang: ...Black market auction? You... You aren't suggesting the president was involved in something like that, are you? Edgeworth: I have no proof. However, the possibility exists, does it not? Kay: Hmm. I wouldn't put it past that president. Lang: HOOOOOOOOOOWWWL! Kay: Eek! Lang: Impossible! The president would never...! He would never be involved in a black market auction! Edgeworth: (Wh... What's this?) Lang: You punks. Are you prepared? If you're gonna spout nonsense like that... I'll tear you into pieces! Kay: Eeeeeek! Edgeworth: (...She ran away.) Lang: You don't have any idea! The amount of respect that man has earned from his country's people! Edgeworth: (I see... We have seen the president's true colors. However, the people of Zheng Fa remain in the dark... Should I inform Agent Lang of the president's true nature? No. Telling him now would only further cloud his judgment...) I understand, Agent Lang. Please calm down. We spoke out of line... I apologize. Lang: ......Sorry. My emotions got the best of me. And Kay, how long do you plan on hiding? You can come out now. Kay: ...I'm sorry. Lang: ...It's fine. My anger is directed towards the president's killer. Lotta: Well, I'll be! Yer actually a pretty good guy, ain't ya? That loyalty to yer president! It's mighty admirable! Lang: Heh. What's it to you? Lotta: Aww, don't be like that. I've got some good news for ya, I reckon. Lang: What? Lotta: The president ain't never passed through the 51st floor. Ya can count on me! Lang: Really? Lotta: I was in the storeroom myself, and I saw it with my very own eyes! Edgeworth: (That's right... She snuck into the storeroom that day.) Lotta's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer. Lang: ...Thanks. ...Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: What is it? Lang: I don't intend to give the culprit a single step of leeway. No one's seen the president since he met with Gravelle two days ago. Edgeworth: That doesn't change the fact that the body wasn't here yesterday. If he were pushed off two days ago, it would be odd that he wasn't found until yesterday. I doubt a fall from the rood would take a whole day. Lang: I'll admit, there are a few things I still haven't figured out. Edgeworth: Regardless... there is one thing I am certain of. Kay: There is? Edgeworth: What exactly occurred here last night? I'm certain we'll have to look into that in order to uncover the truth. Kay: Because the body and the hoofprints could have only appeared last night, right? Officer: Agent Lang! We'd like to bring the body in for the autopsy... Lang: Huang..... It's in your hands. Make sure you show the proper respect. Officer: I also have one more thing to report... Lang: What is it? Officer: We found some footprints near the body! Umm... They were left within the area that looks like a monster's footprint. Edgeworth: (There were human footprints within the monster's footprint?) Lang: What kind of footprints? Officer: Sir! They were the footprints of a child! About the size of an elementary school student! Edgeworth: What!? Penny: Huh!? Kay: A-An elementary school student!? Wait... Could it be...? Edgeworth: (Who... was that?) Penny: U-Umm...! Edgeworth: (Ms. Nichols?) Penny: I... I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you! Please excuse my rudeness! Edgeworth: Is there something you want to say? (What is she so scared of?) Penny: I'm worried that you'll think poorly of me, but... ...please let me testify something! It's really important! Edgeworth: (That's not something you need to be so worried about...) What is it? Penny: Last night... I... I actually came here. Lang: What!? Penny: Eek! Edgeworth: Why did you come here? Penny: ...Well, I got a little worried, so I stopped by... ...to check up on Shaun. Edgeworth: Shaun... You mean Shaun Fenn? (As I thought...) Penny: Yes. Last night, umm... Shaun stayed here late in order to practice by myself. Kay: Wow! He's really dedicated! Penny: Well, this movie is the first time he's starring as the lead role, so... ...I'm sure he wants to do his best...! Edgeworth: (She must have witnessed something last night...) When was this? Penny: Umm... If I remember correctly, I think it was a little past 10 PM. It looked like it was going to rain, and I was getting worried, so I came to check up on him. And when I got here... Well... I, umm... Lang: You... saw something? Penny: .....Y-Yes. Shaun was practicing by himself... ...and right above his head... I saw... a long... long... neck. Kay: A neck? Penny: Y-Yes! Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile... It was like... the neck of a dinosaur! Lotta: Whooooooahhh there! C-Could that've been... ...G-G-Gourdy!? Last time I went huntin' for it, it was a bust... but I reckon, this could be the real deal! Kay: What!? So this time it's Gourdy!? Penny: Th-That's right! I was really surprised! A-After all, Shaun is the boy who can communicate with Moozilla! Lotta: Yeah! That's right! Them horns of his lets him hear what the monster's sayin', right? Penny: E-Even so! He was looking up at Gourdy's face and he was talking to it! It was like they were friends! D-Doesn't that sound weird!? Lotta: You said it, sister! That's pretty darn strange, I reckon! That boy's a little traitor! Edgeworth: (...It seems she's gotten reality mixed up with the movies...) Lang: Hey, Missy... Did you really see that? Penny: Yes! But I was so shocked, I immediately ran home after that. Lang: What do you make of this, Mr. Prosecutor? Has another monster taken the stage? Edgeworth: Agent Lang... Do you really believe this absurd testimony? Lang: Hahahahaha! I couldn't care less about the monsters. However, it looks like who we need to talk to next has been decided now, hasn't it? Edgeworth: Shaun Fenn... He was here last night. It's very likely he saw something... isn't it? Lang: Atta boy! Lang: Shaun Fenn...! We've got some questions for you! ................ Penny: U-Umm... Shaun kind of left a while ago. Lang: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Kay: L-Let's go after him! Lang: Tch! Where'd he run off to!? Edgeworth: He might have just gone back home. Kay: That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today! Lang: ...Or he may have run away. Kay: A-Aren't you just overthinking things? Edgeworth: He's still a child. I can't imagine that he could have murdered the president by himself. Lang: Who said he was alone? Maybe that monster helped him. That boy can summon a monster to his aid, right? Edgeworth: Hmph. Very funny. Lang: I'm not saying that kid's definitely the culprit. But right now, he's the most prominent witness we have, So, we'll need to find that brat. Gumshoe: Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Kay: Ah! Gummy! Gumshoe: Uuugh... I, I... I...! Kay: He ran away... Edgeworth: (What is the detective doing...?) Lang: It doesn't matter... It's not like I can rely on this country's police anyways. Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang. Do you intend to continue investigating by yourself? Lang: Yeah. That's right. You got a problem with that? Kay: Didn't you always have a small army of subordinates with you before? Lang: That's right... But, you know, being a lone wolf isn't all that bad. You don't have to worry about your subordinates or partners. All you need are your fangs. Simple, right? Edgeworth: (Subordinates... and partners...?) Lang: Well then. I'll be seeing you two. Lotta: He he he he. Things are gettin' interestin'! I reckon I'm about to get real busy myself! After all, I got me a pair of monsters to hunt! I'm definitely gettin' my hands on this scoop! Kay: Things have gotten pretty crazy, haven't they? Edgeworth: Indeed. There's the footprints of Moozilla, and now the shadow of Gourdy... It's almost exactly like the movie. Kay: How about we go monster hunting too? Edgeworth: Well... (Hm? Isn't that...?) Kay: Isn't that one of Lang's men...? Edgeworth: (He's one of Agent Lang's subordinates. We met him during another case.) Excuse me... MIB: Oh, Prosecutor Edgeworth. It has been a while. Kay: Shouldn't you be following Mr. Lang? MIB: Agent Lang... Shifu... is no longer my boss. Edgeworth: What exactly happened? MIB: Do you remember the incident from one month ago? Edgeworth: (The \"Yatagarasu Incident\" we had been involved with.) MIB: Agent Lang made a major mistake back then. He almost aided and abetted a dangerous criminal. Edgeworth: (Certainly... it had come quite close to that at the time.) MIB: Shifu took responsibility for what happened... and our team was disbanded. Kay: Disbanded...? Edgeworth: So that's what Agent Lang was talking about when he said he had become a lone wolf. Kay: Then... Why are you here? MIB: That's..... Well. I was a little worried about Shifu. ...It seems that even now, he's still chasing after them. The ghosts of 12 years past... Edgeworth: Ghosts of 12 years past? Just what are you... MIB: .......... I'm sorry. I've already said too much. If you'll excuse me... Edgeworth: (These ghosts Agent Lang is chasing after... Do they also have something to do with this case?) Kay: Looks like everyone's left now... So, what do we do now? Edgeworth: Well... Ms. Hart is going after the monsters, and Agent Lang is going after Shaun. We should also try approaching this case from a different angle. Kay: What angle would that be? Edgeworth: ...We should listen to what Judge Gravelle has to say. Kay: Ah! That's right! If I'm not mistaken, Ms. Gravelle is... Gravelle: ...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Fifi Laguarde's trial. Kay: She said that she had a trial coming up! Edgeworth: Indeed. Let's head to the courthouse as well. Kay: 'Kay! To be continued. Gravelle: Court is now in session. Is the defense ready? Ray: Of course, Your Honor! We can begin whenever you want. Franziska: The prosecution has been ready from the start, Your Honor. Edgeworth: Jill Crane, the attorney in charge of the defense, has passed on from this world. Furthermore, Sebastian Debeste, the prosecutor-in-charge, has disappeared... And so, Franziska and Mr. Shields have taken over their duties. Gravelle: Before we begin, I would like to apologize for the delay of today's trial. As the crime took place in the prison, a place where justice is normally administered... ...and the defendant was the warden of the prison, further exacerbating the situation... ...additional time was specially arranged to investigate and prepare for the trial. In addition, the defense attorney in charge of the case, Jill Crane, has recently passed away... Due to these circumstances, the trial was further delayed. Mr. Shields, Ms. von Karma. At this time, I'd like to give you my gratitude for taking up this responsibility on short notice. Ray: I guess this is the last job Gravelle-pie's friend left behind for us, huh? Well, Uncle Ray's more than happy to help out. Although having said that, I only had enough time to skim through the case files... Are you OK on your end, Franny-pie? Franziska: What kind of prosecutor abandons his own case and vanishes without a trace...!? I won't allow any more delays in this trial while we wait for that foolish man to return. I have received the evidence just now. There should be no problem continuing the trial. Gravelle: ...You have my thanks. And with that, I hereby call the defendant, Fifi Laguarde, to the stand. Laguarde: ........ Gravelle: Now then, will the prosecution please give us their opening statement? Franziska: Very well, Your Honor. The defendant... Laguarde: ...Please wait, Your Honor. Gravelle: What is it? Laguarde: Well, there's something I'd like you to fill me in on. Just what exactly... am I doing in a place like this? Gravelle: Then perhaps... you would do well to listen to the opening statement. Laguarde: Hmm. So if I listen to it, I'll get it, huh? OK then, let's hear it. Franziska: ...That was the plan from the start. Now, if you would kindly shut up and listen. The incident occurred in the detention center and the prison Warden Laguarde is in charge of. The victim is Horace Knightley, who was being held in the detention center. The prosecution is certain that this woman here is the culprit. This knife, the murder weapon, is the decisive evi..... Huh!? Gravelle: Ms. von Karma. Is something wrong? Franziska: Th-That's... impossible! The evidence is...! Ray: What's wrong with the evidence, Franny-pie? Franziska: The evidence... the knife's gone! The chisel with Kanis's bell attached to it is missing too! Ray: Wh... Whaaat!? Gravelle: Order! Order! Prosecutor von Karma. What is the meaning of this? Franziska: I... I don't understand it either, Your Honor. Laguarde: If there's no evidence, then I suppose there's not much reason for me to be here. Some prosecutor. Can't even hold on to one little piece of evidence. What a dunce. Franziska: I... I only received everything that the previous prosecutor had... Ah! Ray: ...It appears the culprit is that pampered prosecutor, the Boy Blunder. Hey, Gravelle-pie. Gravelle: What is it? Ray: Your Honor! Considering our predicament, what say we postpone the trial until later? Gravelle: Gravelle: The defense's proposal is overruled. Ray: Eh? Gravelle-pie...? Laguarde: I know, right? It'd be troubling for me if this trial were to be delayed any further. I just want everyone to know that I'm innocent. As soon as possible. Franziska: Franziska: Innocent!? I've had more than enough of your foolish... Laguarde: And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... \"In court, evidence is everything.\" Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor? Gravelle: .......... That is correct. Franziska: Eh! Ray: What!? Gravelle: The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Fifi Laguarde... Ray: Ray: Hold your horses, Gravelle-pie! You can't just declare her innocent all of a sudden! Gravelle: Is something the matter? For the defense to object to a \"not guilty\" verdict... Ray: Well, I mean... Even you must know that the warden over there is guilty, right? You were there with us when we found the murder weapon! Gravelle: ........ Mr. Shields. A judge must remain impartial when handing down a verdict. That is why I cannot allow myself to get caught up in my own personal feelings... The person who was present when the murder weapon was discovered... ...and the judge sitting before you now, are two completely different people. Ray: ...You're kidding, right? Gravelle: I can only hand down a verdict based upon the evidence that was presented. Franziska: Franziska: There is evidence! It's just... Well, it's not here right now, but... A few minutes, that's all I need! I'll find the evidence and return to court, without fail! The prosecution requests a brief recess, Your Honor! Gravelle: ........ Ray: Th-The defense would also like a recess, Your Honor. Gravelle-pie. Please... Gravelle: ........ ...I understand. I shall grant your request. Laguarde: Well! Verity-darling! Aren't you wishy-washy today? Gravelle: This court will now adjourn for a 15 minute recess! During with, the prosecution and the defense shall prepare for the resumption of the trial. Franziska: ...Understood, Your Honor. Ray: Phew. That was a close one. Gravelle: Court is now adjourned! Kay: Didn't we find it together!? The evidence! Edgeworth: Yes, we certainly did. Gumshoe: Huh? Edgeworth: What's the matter, Detective? Gumshoe: It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator. Kay: Really! Why? Edgeworth: (Of course, that's why the metal detector reacted!) Judge Gravelle, I'd like you to take a look at this. Gravelle: The chisel...? Debeste: Wasn't that just the fake murder weapon? Edgeworth: Kanis hid this chisel inside this dog's mouth. And the real murder weapon was hidden in very much the same way... Laguarde: ...! Edgeworth: The real murder weapon is in the pond, inside the alligator! Edgeworth: I wonder if it was stolen by someone... ???: Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Ms. Berry and Mr. Saint. Did you come to attend the trial? Regina: I came because I heard there's a really fun show around here! So, where is it? Simeon: The trial for the case I got caught up in was supposed to have already started, but... ..our practice ran a little late. I believe it was somewhere around here, wasn't it? Kay: Actually, two key pieces of evidence have gone missing: the chisel and the knife... The trial is in recess now. Sort of like an intermission. You just missed it, Simeon. Simeon: Wha... Whaaaaaat!? Wh-wh-wh-what's that supposed to mean!? Regina: Ah ha ha! Looks like Simeon's going to get arrested again! Simeon: Eeeeeeeeeek! Nowaynowaynoway, I can't...! Kay: Hmm. I guess Simeon is his usual noisy self. ...Huh? ???: To think that I would be humiliated like this! Edgeworth: ...And here comes another noisy individual. Ray: Now, now, Franny-pie. Let's just take a moment and calm down a bit. Maybe you could put that whip of yours away, him? Whaddaya say? Franziska: That foolish prosecutor! When I get my hands on him... ...my whip is going to give him the thrashing of a lifetime! Ray: Eek! Miles, why don't you try talking to her? Edgeworth: (Good grief... On that note, I guess I should probably hear what she has to say.) (Clearing all \"Talk\" options of Franziska and Ray leads to:) Ray: If only there were someone who could go search for the evidence for us... ........ Edgeworth: ........ .....Very well. I'll go look for them. Ray: Oh! Miles! You'd do that for us? Edgeworth: Of course, finding the evidence within fifteen minutes will be no easy task. Ray: Well, if worse comes to worst, Uncle Ray and Franny-pie will help you stall for time. Franziska: .......... Ray: Until you recover the evidence, we won't let her hand down a verdict. Edgeworth: Please do so. ...Franziska, are you OK with this? Franziska: .....You're asking me, Franziska von Karma, to help you out? You'd be better off spending the rest of your life as an anchorman for the local news... Ray: Ms. von Karma. This is an emergency. We could really use your cooperation. Franziska: ! Hmph... I understand. As acting prosecutor, I, along with that attorney over there, shall continue this trial. Meanwhile, you, the \"former\" prosecutor shall run around and look for the evidence... ...all for my sake. It's a job that suits you perfectly! Edgeworth: ...I'm glad that you're on board. Simeon: I-I'll help out too! ...'Cause I really don't wanna get arrested again. Regina: This sounds like fun! Regina wants to tag along too! Edgeworth: Alright. That would be helpful. Now then, where should we begin? Kay: I think we should go find that person, and hear what they have to say! Edgeworth: Who should we talk to in order to learn where the evidence went? Edgeworth: Yes. The person in charge of the evidence was Sebastian Debeste. Simeon: Ah, you mean that rookie prosecutor, right? Got it! Edgeworth: I'll leave him to you. Ray: Alright. Time for Uncle Ray to have a strategy meeting with the opposing counsel. ...Just the two of uUUAAAGH! Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... You better not keep me waiting. Lest you end up like your friend here. Edgeworth: Yes.... I'll keep that in mind. Ray: Franny-pie, wait for meeeee! Edgeworth: Now then, let's go help look for Sebastian as well. Kay: Ah! Edgeworth: (Judge Gravelle...) Gravelle: ...If it isn't Prosecutor Edgeworth. I hope that all is well. Kay: All is NOT well! Just what was going on in that trial earlier...? Edgeworth: Kay! There's no need for that. Kay: But...! Even though Ms. Gravelle should know exactly who the culprit is... What made you...? Gravelle: ........ In a court of law, the only thing that truly matters is evidence... Whatever my own feelings may be, it should not affect the verdict. Edgeworth: So, is this the \"Judge persona\" of Verity Gravelle we're seeing? Gravelle: Cold-blooded and heartless... It's fine if you think of me as such. Edgeworth: (Even as a judge, she's still this stubborn?) Judge Gravelle. There's just... one thing I'd like to ask you. Gravelle: And what would that be? Edgeworth: Two nights ago... you went to the roof of the Grand Tower. Gravelle: ! The roof... you say? Edgeworth: You met with the president there, correct? The two of you were caught on the security camera. Gravelle: Is there some sort of problem with that? Edgeworth: Today... The president's body was discovered. Very close to the Grand Tower. Gravelle: Th-That's...! Edgeworth: You understand now, don't you? You're a suspect. ...What happened between you and the president up on the roof? Gravelle: Nothing... We merely spoke for a few minutes. Once our business was done, I headed straight home. I took the elevator back down alone. Edgeworth: Indeed. That was shown on the security camera footage as well. What exactly did you and the president talk about? Gravelle: Th-That... I cannot say. Edgeworth: (I see. However, I cannot afford to let up just yet. That being the case... Heh. I guess my only remaining options is to use that. She is definitely hiding something...! And I'm going to draw it out of her!) Edgeworth: Two nights ago, Judge Gravelle met with President Huang... Gravelle: ........ Gravelle: ...It is true that I spoke with President Huang on the roof of the Grand Tower. However, we only discussed business. There is no need to tell you what was said. Edgeworth: Hmm... Just like in the trial earlier, she won't reveal her personal feelings easily. When she's speaking as a judge, it would be better for me to wait and see what develops. Now then, I'll start by asking her what she talked about with the president! Edgeworth: Could you tell me... what you and the president talked about? Gravelle: My meeting with the president was strictly business. And since it has nothing to do with you, I am not obligated to answer your question. Edgeworth: ...... Gravelle: I appreciate your understanding. Edgeworth: Even so... You certainly are a very busy person, aren't you? You're a member of the P.I.C. and a judge as well. You even assist with the investigations. Gravelle: I am simply fulfilling the professional duties that have been assigned to me. Edgeworth: Was your meeting with the president also one of the duties assigned to you as a judge? Gravelle: .....Yes. Of course it was. I... am one who lives for the law. I would never act outside my professional duties. Edgeworth: This morning, you returned Kay's \"promise notebook\" to me. I don't believe that all of yours actions are simply done for the sake of your duties. Gravelle: .....It's true, it seems I still retain some immature qualities. Edgeworth: I wouldn't call it immature. It was your own personal kindness. Weren't you also distressed when you found out the president had passed away? Gravelle: Yes... It is very unfortunate... Why did he have to die...? Edgeworth: It seems he was crushed by the head of a monster called the \"Mighty Moozilla\". Ah... Excuse me. You see, Moozilla is... Gravelle: I-Is that true!? You mean... the president died at the temporary Moozilla film lot...? Edgeworth: Yes. That's right... I'm surprised that you know about Moozilla. Gravelle: Y-Yes... I had heard about it from Sebastian. He told me that the movie was being filmed near the Grand Tower... Edgeworth: ...She seems awfully shaken up about that. And I'm also curious about Sebastian, who went missing along with the evidence. She said she wouldn't talk about the president... However, I might be able to get her to reveal her secret through another line of questioning. She is flustered beyond normal. There must be some reason behind it! Edgeworth: Franziska may have taken over the prosecution in Sebastian's place, however... ...as long as he still possesses some of the evidence, the trial cannot proceed. Gravelle: I intend to carry out a fair trial. If the prosecution is unable to present evidence... the defendant must be declared not guilty. Edgeworth: ...... Gravelle: I am a judge. I cannot allow my own personal feelings to get in the way. Edgeworth: So, you're saying you're not the least bit worried about Sebastian's whereabouts? Gravelle: Of course... I am... I am worried about Sebastian, as well, but... Edgeworth: You're worried about Sebastian \"as well\"? Wouldn't that mean... ...that there is someone else you're worried about? Gravelle: Ah...! Edgeworth: By any chance... would that person have something to do with your unnatural behavior? Gravelle: ...That's impossible. I... ...I am a follower of the law... I will not... be swayed by... personal feelings. Edgeworth: It may be true that those who stand in court have a duty to follow the law. However, we're not superheroes! You and I are only human. It is impossible to completely ignore your own feelings and render an impartial judgement! Gravelle: Aaaaaaah! .....It is as you say. As I am now... I cannot hand down an impartial verdict. Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Why don't you tell me the truth? Gravelle: I... I...! Just what am I supposed to do...!? Edgeworth: For Judge Gravelle to become this distraught... I should find out exactly who she is searching for. Up until now, she has been wearing the mask of a judge... This time, I should be able to draw out her true feelings! Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: Earlier, when Moozilla was brought up, it seemed to be a sensitive topic for you... Is that \"child\" you spoke of involved with the Moozilla movie? Gravelle: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! H-How!? How do you know that...!? Edgeworth: You're usually so calm, yet you seem rather distraught right now. Please, tell me... Who is that child!? Gravelle: ...I understand. If you've come to know this much... I shall prepare myself for the worst. The child I'm searching for... is a boy by the name of Shaun Fenn. Edgeworth: Shaun...? Why do you want to know his whereabouts? Gravelle: Well... That much, I simply cannot say... Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Didn't you say you were prepared for the worst!? Gravelle: .....! Edgeworth: Even if you don't intend to talk, I am determined to expose the truth. ...That is my resolve. Why is she searching for Shaun... I must get her to tell me the reason. Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: I don't know what kind of relationship you have with Shaun... ...but at the very least, the two of you must be acquaintances! Gravelle: E... Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Won't you allow us to help you in your search for him? Gravelle: Help...? No, that won't be allowed? Edgeworth: Who won't allow it? The so-called Goddess of Law? Gravelle: ...The person who knows where that child is.. Edgeworth: I see... Finally, I've connected all the pieces of the puzzle. The reason why you cannot easily talk about Shaun... It was because... Someone kidnapped him, isn't that right? Gravelle: A-Aah... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: ...Judge Gravelle. I would like to hear the truth from your own lips. Gravelle: .....I understand. This time... I will truly be prepared for the worst. It is just as you deduced... Someone has kidnapped Shaun. Edgeworth: ! As I thought... There was a kidnapping! Still, how is Shaun's kidnapping related to you in any way? Gravelle: ......Shaun and I are... ...mother and child... Edgeworth: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? I was unable to learn much about the conversation she had with the president, but... ...I have learned of Shaun's kidnapping. ...It was an unexpected result, but with that... it's checkmate. Gravelle: ....... Kay: Whaaat!? J-Shaun is... Ms. Gravelle's son!? No way! I mean, he's already so big, for him to be your... Gravelle: Yes... Shaun is indeed my son. Please look at this... Edgeworth: (This is a clipping from a magazine...) Kay: It's an article about Shaun! Do you always carry this around with you? Gravelle: Yes. I always keep it close by. It's like a charm to me... Edgeworth: (It seems the bond that they share is a strong one.) Gravelle: ....... Edgeworth: However, are you absolutely certain that he's been kidnapped? Gravelle: Yes. I received a call from the kidnapper just before the trial started... Edgeworth: What were their demands? Gravelle: They had only one demand. A \"Not Guilty\" verdict for Fifi Laguarde... Edgeworth: (I see. So that's what happened...) Laguarde: And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... \"In court, evidence is everything.\" Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor? Gravelle: .......... That is correct. The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Fifi Laguarde... Edgeworth: So, that's why you were going to deliver a \"Not Guilty\" verdict earlier? Gravelle: I am... not qualified to be a judge... A judge must be able to remain impartial and composed, above all else. And yet... despite this, in the trial just now, I... ...I was about to hand down a verdict that was led solely by my heart! Edgeworth: .....Judge Gravelle. Gravelle: The Goddess of Law must be furious with me... ...but, I simply couldn't do it. I couldn't hand down a fair verdict... if it meant I had to sacrifice my own son! Kay: Of course you can't! Edgeworth: (Kay...) Kay: A real parent... would never abandon their own child! If that makes the Goddess of Law angry, then maybe the Goddess is the one who's wrong! The Goddess is guilty! Guilty! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Indeed. (To declare a goddess guilty...) We're responsible for upholding the law, but at the same time, we are only human. Nobody would hand down a verdict that would sacrifice their own child. Gravelle: .....Thank you very much. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth. However... I cannot simply run away from the courtroom. Bailiff: Judge Gravelle! So this is where you've been. Gravelle: It appears it's time... Kay: .......... Ms. Gravelle! ...My father, he was a prosecutor. Gravelle: Your father...? Kay: Yes. He stood in court, just like you. ...And now, with all that has happened, it got me thinking... What if, my father had been in the same position as you are now? Gravelle: If a prosecutor was being coerced into obtaining a guilty verdict... Kay: I know... if my life were on the line, my father... ...would definitely come to steal me back! Gravelle: Steal you... back? Kay: Ms. Gravelle. Why don't you let us take care of it? Gravelle: What...? Kay: I'm gonna go steal Shaun back for you! As the second Yatagarasu, I, Kay Faraday, give you my word! Gravelle: ...... Edgeworth: (Heh. So, the Great Thief Yatagarasu plans to steal the \"truth\", huh...) What say you, Judge Gravelle? Will you place your trust in our young Great Thief? Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth... Edgeworth: And, if it's alright with you, I wish to help as well. Gravelle: .....Thank you very much. I know that it's really not my place to ask this of you... ...but please... do whatever you can... Please save Shaun. Kay: You got it! Just leave everything to us! Gravelle: Allow me to leave my cellphone with you. You may get a call from the kidnapper at some point. Edgeworth: You have my word. I will ensure the safe return of your phone, alone with your son. Gravelle: And I will do everything in my power to prolong the trial. But... even then, at most the trial can only last for about two more hours... Edgeworth: (Two hours, huh... So, until 2 PM. That's our time frame...) Gravelle: ...I must return to court. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall leave the rest to you. Edgeworth: Heh. Kay, I thought you were taking a break from being the Great Thief? Kay: As of right now, the Great Thief Yatagarasu is back in business! Alright! Time to put on the gloves and hit the pavement! It's my first request, after all! Edgeworth: Is that so? In that case, we'd better begin our investigation posthaste... ...if we hope to track down Shaun... Lang: Tch! Where'd he run off to!? Edgeworth: He might have just gone back home. Kay: That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today! Lang: ...Or he may have run away. Edgeworth: We should probably begin our investigation from the front of the Grand Tower. Kay: H-Hey! Hold it, Mr. Edgeworth! You're not the one in charge anymore! From here on out, this is a job for a Great Thief! Which means, I'm the leader now! Edgeworth: ...If that's the case, then what am I supposed to do? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, you get to be... the first ever Great Thief's Assistant! Edgeworth: (So, I'm a thief's assistant now...?) Kay: Alright! Let's get going! The Great Thief Yatagarasu takes flight once again! Kay: Here we are! The scene of the crime! Let's get to work! Now, say it with me, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Hm? Say what? Kay: \"Even in the depths of night...\" Edgeworth: .......... Kay: Aww, come on! Say the rest with me! Edgeworth: And just why should I do that!? Kay: Because! The Great Thief Yatagarasu has arrived on the scene! If we don't say the introduction, it just doesn't feel right! Edgeworth: I have no intention of becoming a thief. Kay: Aargh! Fine, then. I'll do it by myself! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: Yes, Kay. I know you are. I, on the other hand, am starting the investigation. Kay: Tch. You're no fun. Edgeworth: ...We don't have time for \"fun\". We only have until 2 o'clock. We need to begin making inquiries immediately. Kay: Good thing we have a photo, so we can go right ahead and start asking around! (Examining trailer after clearing all \"Talk\" options of Powers, blue truck, taxi, and film equipment and talking with officer leads to:) Edgeworth: (Hmm. It's already half past 12...) Kay: I wonder how Ms. Gravelle and the others are holding up... Edgeworth: How long will they be able to prolong the trial...? Kay: We gotta hurry and find Shaun! Edgeworth: Indeed. Lotta: Aww heck naw! That ain't how it's done! Ya ain't gonna catch a scoop like that! Nicole: S-Sorry, Chief! Lotta: What am I always tellin' ya!? We're beasts! Scoop-eatin' animals! It's scoop or starve! No story, no glory! Ya gotta get fired up! Nicole: Yessir! As expected of my mentor! Edgeworth: They're here... (It's those noisy reporters.) Kay: Hey, they came here too! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go talk to them! Edgeworth: ...Good grief. If we must. Edgeworth: What if the kidnappers stole the box? Kay: Ah! You mean they...! Edgeworth: Exactly. They took it in order to carry Shaun inside it. Kay: Shaun's a tiny kid, after all. Then, the reason the taxi driver didn't see Shaun was because... Edgeworth: It's likely he was put in the trunk as the kidnapper's luggage. Kay: But, why did they need to go through all the trouble of hiding him? Edgeworth: At first, the kidnappers must have intended to abduct him without being seen. However, they didn't anticipate all the policemen in the plaza. Kay: Ah, I see. If they tried to just walk away with him, they would've been spotted... Edgeworth: Just the mere presence of policemen would have been a sizable threat. Kay: I geddit! In that case, we've gotta ask the taxi driver! Edgeworth: Did the two men you told us about earlier have any luggage with them? Driver: Yeah. They stuffed a huge box into the trunk. Kay: Then that's that! Those guys must be the kidnappers! Edgeworth: Do you remember where you took those men? Driver: Sounds to me like something serious has gone down here... If you'd like, I could take you to the same place I took them. Kay: Let's do it, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes. Thank you for your help. Driver: No problemo! Just leave it to me! Kay: Uugh... That taxi drove way too fast. I don't feel too good. Edgeworth: ........ Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, are you alright? Your face is really pale. Edgeworth: I-I'm fine. The driver said they came to this house's garage... Kay: This must be where those two men brought the box! ...Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Look at the nameplate on the door! Edgeworth: Nameplate...? What!? \"Blaise Debeste\"!? Kay: So this is... the chairman's house! Edgeworth: (Does that mean the one who kidnapped Shaun was Blaise Debeste? Blaise should have already been arrested though...) Kay: Ah! The garage door is unlocked! Edgeworth: You really do have a good eye for this sort of thing... Edgeworth: (It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.) Kay: Excuse me... we're coming in... Anybody home? Edgeworth: Doing something like this, it's as if we're a couple of petty thieves...! Kay: Shh! Be quiet! Right now, we're Great Thieves! Have some self-awareness! Edgeworth: (...She scolded me.) Nobody's here... For now, it looks like we can get through this without being arrested. Kay: This isn't the time to be relieved! Now the real deal begins! Let's go look for treasure! Edgeworth: (We are looking for Shaun, not treasure...) (Examining the \"Cement bag\", \"Shovel and sledgehammer\", \"Gloves\" and \"Green box\" leads to:) ???: ...*thump, thump*... Edgeworth: Hm? Kay: Th-There's someone inside! ???: ...*thump, thump*... *thump, thump*... *CRASH*! Edgeworth: Is it... Shaun...? Kay: Shaun! We're coming to save you! ......Eh? Edgeworth: (Th-This is...!) You're..... S-Sebastian! Kay: Whaaaaat!? Why!? Debeste: Nnnnf, Nmmnnnmmf! Kay: This is Blaise's house, right? That would mean... Edgeworth: Yes. It should also be Sebastian's house. (So then, why is he...?) Kay, go help him out. Kay: If it has to do with ropes, just leave it to Kay! Here I go! A little pull over here, and a quick tug over there! Are you alright, Sebastian? Debeste: .......... Edgeworth: (He looks a little worse for wear.) Why were you tied up in a place like this? Debeste: .....How should I know!? Y-You guys don't know anything about me! Edgeworth: .....It's because we don't know. That's why we're asking you... Debeste: .......... Kay: He's completely shut off his heart... Edgeworth: Indeed... If it's come to this... ...I suppose I have no choice but to use that. Kay: Ah! You mean! Edgeworth: I hate to do this when he's in such a fragile state. It's like kicking a man who's down... Kay: ...Will it be alright? His mind might break if you corner him too much, y'know? Edgeworth: Yes. I am aware of that. I will try to be careful. (Good grief. I wonder how this will turn out... I've never held back against anyone before...) Edgeworth: After running out of the meeting room this morning, why would he be here of all places...? Debeste: You guys... You don't know how I feel! Edgeworth: (He's gone through a lot of shock. He must be on the verge of an emotional meltdown.) It can't be helped... At times like this, I must quietly listen to what he has to say. Debeste: N-No one tells me anything... I'm always the only one being left out like an idiot...! Edgeworth: (Hmm... I should try to answer his questions as best as I can.) Considering how fragile he is... I won't have much time to spare. I'll need to ask about his true feelings, and try to calm him down posthaste! Edgeworth: Could you please tell me what's on your mind? Debeste: I... I don't wanna! It's not like you'd listen to me anyways! Edgeworth: ..... Debeste: Wh-What's wrong? Normally, you'd be shouting \"Objection!\" right about now! Edgeworth: ..... Debeste: ...You're serious? Y-You're really... gonna listen to what I have to say? Edgeworth: I can understand... the shock you went through after what happened with your father. Debeste: It wasn't just Pops. This morning, I... I lost everything! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: E-Everything I have... was given to me by Pops... T-Tell me, Mr. Edgeworth... Just what am I supposed to believe in...? Edgeworth: If you can't believe in others, then at least believe in yourself. You'll need to gain experience on your own, but if you require wisdom, I can lend you a hand. Debeste: ! ...Ever since I got locked up, I've been thinking... ...am I too inculpable to be a prosecutor... uh? Incapable...? Erm, which one was it? Edgeworth: I believe \"incapable\" is the word you are looking for. Judging your own ability is not an easy task. Sebastian. Little by little, you are growing. Debeste: ! Edgeworth: Sebastian. Would you tell me your side of the story? Debeste: .....I-I understand. What... should I talk about? Edgeworth: Hmm. He seems to have calmed down slightly. I'd like you to tell me everything you know about the kidnappers. Now then... Tell me what you heard and saw! Edgeworth: Let me try using that clue... Edgeworth: Kidnapping his own son in order to demand a ransom wouldn't make such sense. Debeste: .....Y-Yeah, you're right! Edgeworth: Did you notice anything strange when you got kidnapped? Debeste: Oooh... As soon as I answered their question, they just took me away... Edgeworth: They asked you a question...? Tell me what they asked you! Debeste: Waaah! D-Don't glare at me like that... Erm... I think they asked me, \"Do you know Gravelle?\" Edgeworth: ! I see.. The pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall into place. Blaise... and the kidnappers did not intend to kidnap you. Their objective was Shaun Fenn. They were planning to kidnap Judge Gravelle's son... ...in order to have Fifi Laguarde declared not guilty! Debeste: J-Verity has a son...? And Warden Laguarde gets declared not guilty...? Edgeworth: I suspect... the kidnappers mistook you for Shaun Fenn. Debeste: A-All of this... was just a mistake? ! Wait... maybe that's why, back then...! Edgeworth: Hm...? Did you just remember something? Debeste: N-No..... It's nothing! I'm useless anyways... Just... leave me alone already! Edgeworth: Th-This is bad! He might be at his emotional limit...! I must get him to tell me what he remembered, and try to calm him down as well. Based on how distressed Sebastian looks right now... ...it must have been quite traumatic. I'll need to help him get back on his feet! Edgeworth: What did you remember just now? Debeste: I-I didn't remember anything... about Po... that guy... Edgeworth: Would \"that guy\" happen to be Blaise? Debeste: D-Darniiiiiit! Oooh... So this is the difference between me and someone who earned his Prosecutor title... Edgeworth: ...I've been waiting to ask you: Why did you become a prosecutor? Debeste: What does it matter!? I'm not fit to be a prosecutor anyways! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: S-Say something! Edgeworth: You must have some reason for choosing this path, right? Debeste: ...N-No, it's not like that! It wasn't anything special! I became a prosecutor for a really insignificant reason! Edgeworth: ...... Debeste: It was just... a personal reason. Edgeworth: Heh... Just like you, I, too, became a prosecutor for a personal reason. Debeste: Huh...? I-Is that true...? B-But... you're a really successful prosecutor... I'm sure that Pops... the P.I.C. chairman... would have been more proud of you than me. Edgeworth: I see... so, you wanted your father's approval. Debeste: Ooh.....! I thought that if I became the best prosecutor, he'd be proud of me! That's why I...! I just wanted to help out Pops as much as I could......! Edgeworth: Would you... happen to be protecting your father? Debeste: Wha... I-I don't have any reason to protect someone like him...! Edgeworth: Didn't you want to help out your father... as much as you could? Debeste: Uuuuuunngh... Just once... I only wanted to be useful to Pops just this once! That way... I could help him regain his repetition! Edgeworth: You seem to be mixing up your words again... The word you're looking for is \"reputation\". Debeste: Huh? N-No one's ever told me that before! Edgeworth: Your father, who has strayed from his path, continues to add to his crimes... Even knowing that, do you truly want things to stay the way they are? Debeste: But... in that case, just what am I supposed to do? Edgeworth: You should triumph over your father, who has treated you like a fool. You must stop Blaise before he commits another crime! Debeste: ! I never thought of it that way. I... I want to triumph over Pops! Edgeworth: ...Somehow, it seems he has calmed down once again. Now's my chance to ask him about Blaise's secret! I will give Sebastian the courage to stand up to his father! Edgeworth: Hmm... He seems to have become unsettled again. I suppose I should lend him a hand... Edgeworth: The place you thought would be the safest... Would that have been in Blaise Debeste's hands? Debeste: Ungh... Waaaaaahhh! H-He told me that it would be safer if he took care of the evidence! Edgeworth: I'm sorry... but he has betrayed your trust in the worst way possible. Debeste: Pops... why would he want to hide the evidence...? Edgeworth: Blaise's objective was to have Warden Laguarde found not guilty, by obscuring the truth... Sebastian. You... were used by your father! Debeste: Ungh... Uwaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: It's possible that Blaise Debeste has the evidence with him. Furthermore, we still have no idea where Shaun is. I must return to my investigation posthaste, however... Debeste: This... This is all my fault...! What am I gonna do now...!? Edgeworth: ...Seeing him like this, I can't just leave him be. He is still suffering in the gap between his ideal and reality. He will never move on until he figures out how to live his own life! Sebastian is about to face his greatest trial. Perhaps this is fate. I shall give him the push forward that he needs. Edgeworth: For goodness' sake... Don't you remember your own words? Perhaps his \"own will\" can show him the way. Edgeworth: As a prosecutor... didn't you want to walk a different path from your father? Certainly, the path you have chosen is not an easy one. Nevertheless, you still chose to live as a prosecutor. In that case, it should be clear to you what you need to do...! Debeste: ! Edgeworth: ...I still question how I live my life to this day. But you, Sebastian... have found your own answer. So believe in yourself, Prosecutor Debeste! Debeste: I... WAAAAAAAAAAH! Edgeworth: (He was mistaken for Shaun, and kidnapped by Blaise's underlings. And after his father stole his evidence, he lost his confidence as a prosecutor... The emotions he is going through must be more painful than anything I could imagine.) It's taken longer than I thought... but with that, it's checkmate. Debeste: U-unh, uugh... ungh...! D... D-D-D-D... DARN IIIIIIIIIIIT! Edgeworth: .......... Kay: H-He dashed out of here at full speed... Edgeworth: (It seems if there's one thing he's \"the best\" at, it's running away...) Edgeworth: (Curses! We're running out of time...) We should check in with Mr. Shields. (I'd also like to know what the situation is like on their end.) Kay: But Mr. Debeste ran off again... Edgeworth: We'll just give them the new information we discovered. Franziska will take his place. Kay: Hmm... I wonder if that's going to be enough... Edgeworth: It can't be helped. Since he ran away, there's nothing more we can do. District Court - Courtroom No. 3 Ray: Eerm. I guess I'll just say it again. If there's no murder weapon, you can't prove the defendant is guilty. Franziska: Franziska: Just because we don't have the murder weapon, doesn't mean the defendant is innocent! It seems you wish to taste the sting of my whip. Ray: Gyaaah! Laguarde: Mr. Attorney. This trial... How much longer will it take? Because it feels like it hasn't gone anywhere at all for a good while now! Ray: Well, sorry, but that stubborn prosecutor over there just doesn't seem to understand. Franziska: Until I am satisfied... ...this whip will lash out at you as many times as I see fit. Ray: (By now, she's probably whipped me once for every year I've been alive... Miles... What's taking you so long? Even though we're just stalling for time, Uncle Ray can't keep this up much longer!) Whoops, 'scuse me. Phone call. Mind if I take this? Gravelle: ...I will allow it. Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. Ray: Oh, Miles, it's you. How's it going over there? Edgeworth: We found Sebastian. Ray: Oh! And the knife and chisel? Edgeworth: It seems he handed the evidence over to Blaise Debeste. It's very likely that Blaise knows the whereabouts of the murder weapon. Ray: Ex-chairman Debeste!? But, why would Blaise...? Edgeworth: That, I don't know yet. However, there may be some hidden connection between... ...Fifi Laguarde and Blaise. Ray: Gotcha. In that case, I'll issue a subpoena for Blaise Debeste right away. Edgeworth: ! Ray: I'll grill him personally. Edgeworth: I will continue to search for the missing evidence. (And for Shaun, as well...) Ray: Try to hurry it up, would ya? We're at our wits end over here! It feels like the verdict could be handed down at any moment! Edgeworth: Understood. (How much longer can Judge Gravelle's heart hold out? I know she's in a lot of pain... I've got to hurry.) Outside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza Kay: So? How's the trial going? Edgeworth: Blaise will be taking the stand. I don't know how things will turn out, though. Kay: He'll do anything, from hiding evidence to kidnapping... He really is nothing but trouble. Edgeworth: I agree. We should probably take another look at the evidence concerning him. Kay: OK! Leave it to me! First, here's the latest evidence fresh from the scene! Edgeworth: They're... the gloves from earlier. Although I am certainly curious about them... Anything else? Kay: The case files from the IS-7 Incident. If I recall, Blaise was also involved in this, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. He was involved in destroying the evidence. For now, let's keep this on hand. IS-7 Incident Documents jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Now then... is there anything else? Kay: Of course! Last but not least... We've got this! Edgeworth: This is... the Yatagarasu's badge. ...Kay. I'm talking about things related to Blaise. Please be serious. Kay: But aren't you always going around presenting random evidence too, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Gah...! No... W-Well... That's... Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?) Kay: Ah! What're you doing here? Debeste: WHOOOOOOOAAAHH! Kay: H-He ignored us... Edgeworth: (He came out of the Grand Tower... What was he doing in there?) Kay: Let's go investigate what Mr. Debeste was up to! Edgeworth: Yes... Let us go. Grand Tower - Rooftop Edgeworth: Hm? (The hatch is open...) Kay: It might be Mr. Debeste who opened it! Grand Tower - 51st Floor Storeroom Edgeworth: (Did Sebastian come in here...?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Over there! The safe's open! Edgeworth: (Did he come here to open that? ...Let's examine it thoroughly.) Kay: There's something inside the safe! Edgeworth: Let's go ahead and have a look. There are some documents in here... Kay: Hmm... it's just a bunch of papers and... huh? There's a photo here too. Edgeworth: Hm? This is a picture of...! Kay: Huh!? Th-That's Mr. Knightley! Knightley: ...Horace Knightley. The president's bodyguard. Kay: Why is his picture here? And what are all of these papers for!? Edgeworth: I don't know... We will have to read the documents to find out. I'm all but certain there is a connection between Knightley and Kanis. Kanis's chess partner, whose identity remained unknown until now... ...was actually Knightley all along. That is proof enough. Tomorrow, I shall interrogate him in the warden's office. I'll get him to confess that he's one of Kanis's henchmen. That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago... ...you simply must retrieve it. Edgeworth: This... seems to be a report about Knightley. Kay: Not to mention, it was apparently written before Knightley was killed...! Edgeworth: (Horace Knightley was murdered while he was being interrogated in the warden's office...) Judging from the contents, this document was probably written by Fifi Laguarde. Kay: I knew it! Edgeworth: The question, however, is who this report was addressed to. Kay: Ah! The owner of this safe is...! Edgeworth: The Conductor... Blaise Debeste. Kay: So, this proves that Ms. Laguarde and Blaise are connected! Edgeworth: Indeed. However, it's not just the two of them. Kay: Huh? Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste and Fifi Laguarde were searching for Kanis's henchmen. Kay: Bodhidharma Kanis! That dog-loving assassin! Edgeworth: This means that there is a hidden connection between the three of them. Kay: I wonder what it could be? Edgeworth: I don't know, but it must be related to this case. Report on Knightley jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: Ah! There's some other stuff in here that I remember seeing! Edgeworth: Hm? There's something on his finger. Kay: Let's have a closer look! Oh! It looks like an expensive ring! Edgeworth: Don't steal it. Kay: Wha...! I didn't do anything yet! Edgeworth: It's Horace Knightley's... The chessboard and the ring... All of his possessions are inside this safe. Kay: So basically, all of this stuff is evidence from the prison case? Edgeworth: Correct. Kay: Then, the knife and chisel that vanished might be in here too! Let's see. Mr. Knife... Mr. Chisel... Hmm. They're not in there... I guess this is all just Mr. Knightley's stuff. Edgeworth: I see... That's too bad. (Horace Knightley... is dead.) Knightley: EEEEEDGEWOOOOOORTH!!! This game isn't over yet! You hear me! I...! I...! Edgeworth: (However, the game is not over yet... ...unless I can see it through to its end!) Knightley's Mementos data jotted down in my Organizer. Grand Tower - Rooftop ???: Young lady, good sir. ...Might I interest you in some cotton candy? Edgeworth: Hm? ???: There is also ice cream, if that is what you'd prefer? Edgeworth: Y-You! Sh-Shelly de Killer! de Killer: It's good to see you are well, Mr. Edgeworth. Kay: Wh-What are you doing in a place like this!? de Killer: As you can see, I am selling cotton candy. Would you care for some \"Heavenly Cotton Candy\"? Even sweeter than death. One bite will send you straight to heaven. Edgeworth: (That's definitely not something I'd want to buy from De Killer.) de Killer: The meaning of my message... Have you understood it? de Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved? Edgeworth: Have you been spying on us this whole time? de Killer: Spying? Heavens no. I was simply watching over you... ...while disguised as a cotton candy salesman. Edgeworth: (Isn't that the exact same thing!? What is this man's objective?) Were you the one... who murdered the president? de Killer: No. The contact with my client has already expired. ...President Huang is a bit of a celebrity in the world of assassins, you see. Over the years, many attempts on his life were made, and yet, he stubbornly lives on. He is a robust man, surrounded by flawless security. He even employs body doubles. Edgeworth: (Robust... That president? Rotund seems more apt.) ...However, it seems this time the president's security wasn't exactly flawless. Kay: Mr. Rooke had only just prevented your previous assassination, but this time...! de Killer: I did not kill him. It is not my principle to kill needlessly. I am also grateful to Rooke, a worthy adversary who was connected to me by fate. Thanks to that man, I did not kill a target who had no value to be killed. Edgeworth: (\"Thanks\" to Rooke preventing the assassination... What does he mean?) de Killer: My client deliberately gave me a false target. ...It was a betrayal most foul. I am now searching for my client. In all likelihood... ...it is the same person you are looking for. Edgeworth: (Is he saying that his client murdered the president?) Just who is this person you are referring to...? de Killer: I, myself, am not allowed to say. It would be a violation of the rules. I cannot disclose the identity of my clients. For to do so would create a problem of trust with my other clients. This is precisely why I am personally searching for them myself. Kay: What are you going to do when you find your client? de Killer: Of course... they shall be rewarded with a punishment most befitting of a traitor. Kay: Whaaaa!? That person... Wh-What'll happen to them? de Killer: ...I will leave that up to your imagination. Edgeworth: (It certainly won't be anything pleasant...) de Killer: Oh, yes... I will tell you just one more thing. Three days ago, Bodhidharma Kanis escaped from prison. Edgeworth: What!? de Killer: Three nights past, Kanis's solitary cell was found vacant. It was almost as if he knew I would come pay a visit. Edgeworth: (He visited Kanis's cell? Could it be, that the person De Killer is searching for is...) de Killer: Well then, if you'll excuse me, I must get going. Let us both do our best in tracking down that person... Edgeworth: (So, De Killer and Kanis. These two assassins...) Outside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza Edgeworth: (Hmm. This sound is...) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Judge Gravelle's cellphone is ringing! Edgeworth: (Could it be Shaun?) ???: Mr. Edgeworth. How are you doing? Edgeworth: (It sounds like they're using a voice changer...) Who is this? ???: Someone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood... Edgeworth: (The red hood?) ...Are you the person who ambushed Kay? ???: Brilliant deduction! I'd expect no less from a prodigy prosecutor such as yourself! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I wanna listen in on this too! Edgeworth: Very well. (I'll put it on speaker...) ???: Well, I must say that I didn't expect the girl to get amnesia. Kay: Hey! What's that supposed to mean!? ???: But that's not all, y'see. Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane. Edgeworth: What!? (This must be the person De Killer spoke of...!) ???: I really should thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: You have no reason to thank me! ???: Oh, you haven't noticed? My, that's troublesome, y'know. I wanted you to catch Blaise for me... ...so I took dear little Kay. Edgeworth: What? ???: If Kay was suspected, I knew you would investigate the case. And I was sure that the great Miles Edgeworth would be able to catch Blaise! It was according to my plan! And y'know, I get the feeling that you have the wrong idea, so let me clear something up. Blaise Debeste wasn't the one who kidnapped Ms. Gravelle's son. Edgeworth: ! You... Why do you know about the kidnapping? ???: You and Ms. Gravelle are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you... Edgeworth: (How could this person know something like that...? Judge Gravelle was supposed to have visited me using the detective's name...) ???: I bet you're wondering how I knew about the kidnapping, right? It's quite simple, really! It's because darling little Shaun is in my care right now. Edgeworth: What!? Kay: Huh!? ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Quickly, little Kay! You have to hurry and steal him back! You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you? Kay: You even know it's my first job!? Edgeworth: (Why does this person know everything in so much detail?) ???: Well... I suppose I can't blame you for your mistake. It seems Blaise was after Shaun as well, y'see. Edgeworth: (So there were two kidnappings...) ???: He's such a fool, y'know. Kidnapping his own son instead! Edgeworth: Is Shaun there with you? If he is, then I would like to hear his voice. ???: Hmm. He's here, but I'm afraid I can't do that. Y'see, he's asleep right now. Edgeworth: In that case, there's no way for us to know if you really kidnapped Shaun or not. ???: ...Hmph. I suppose you don't have to believe me if you don't want to. Edgeworth: What is your objective? Is it to get Fifi Laguarde declared not guilty? ???: A not guilty verdict, eh... I couldn't care less about that. Edgeworth: (So his objective is different from Blaise's?) ???: ...I think I'll keep my objective a secret for now. Well then, I must be going. I hope you enjoy yourself, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Don't think you can get away with this. ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: Ngh...! Kay: Who in the world was that...? Edgeworth: I don't know. We don't have enough information. Kay: Darn it! We're totally clueless! Meanwhile, they seem to know everything about us! Edgeworth: ! (Know everything about us...?) Kay, you're right. Thinking about it, it is strange. How does the culprit know so much about us? Kay: It's so weird! I mean they even know about the kidnapping! Edgeworth: We must figure out how the culprit was able to obtain that information. (I must recall... What exactly did that person know?) ???: You and Ms. Gravelle are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you... ???: You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you? Kay: You even know it's my first job!? ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Edgeworth: (That's it! By analyzing our conversation with the culprit...!) I've figured it out, Kay. I know the source of this person's information! Kay: What!? Really!? Edgeworth: In all likelihood, this person probably... Edgeworth: I believe it is highly likely that we have been bugged. Kay: B-Bugged!? Edgeworth: If you recall what that person said... ???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Edgeworth: If they couldn't see our faces, that means they weren't talking our pictures or following us. Kay: Th-Then, they must've planted a bug somewhere! Could it be in my stuff...? Edgeworth: (Was there anything they could have had a chance to bug...? There must be a hint somewhere in our conversation just now... That's right... that person knew something they shouldn't have. The conversation between Judge Gravelle and myself in the visitor's room...) Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! Gravelle: Hush. Please, have a seat. Edgeworth: (The only evidence I had with me at the time was...!) Where was the bug planted...? Edgeworth: Kay. May I see your badge? Kay: My Yatagarasu's badge? No way! Edgeworth: Wh-Why not...? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, just because you became a Great Thief's assistant... ...doesn't mean you're ready to wear this badge yet! Edgeworth: That's not it! It's very likely that a bug was planted in it. Kay: Whaaat!? In my badge? Edgeworth: Let's take a closer look. Kay: Ah! This is...! Edgeworth: It seems I was right. Yatagarasu's Badge data updated in my Organizer. Kay: How did you know? Edgeworth: The person had been in contact with you. Kay: You mean, when I was knocked unconscious. Edgeworth: Yes. That's why I thought one of your possessions might have been bugged. However, that person also overheard my conversation with Judge Gravelle. Even though that conversation took place in the visitor's room with just the two of us... Kay: Ah, so you were holding onto it at that time... Edgeworth: Exactly. All the other evidence had been taken away from me... Only the Yatagarasu's badge remained with me. Kay: So this creep's been listening in on us the whole time! Edgeworth: Indeed. That must be how they knew about all the information we collected. Kay: Does that mean... they're also listening in on this conversation? Edgeworth: Most likely. Kay: Hey, buster! Edgeworth: K-Kay... Kay: Eavesdropping is for cowards! Why don't you come out here and fight us fair and square!? Edgeworth: (Hm? What was that sound just now?) Nicole: Owwwwwwww... Kay: Huh? That's... Nicole! Nicole: Honestly, y'all scared the bejeezus out of me! Your voice was so loud there, Lil' Missy... I was so surprised I done fell flat on my behind! Kay: I-I'm sorry...! Nicole: What were ya gettin' so riled up for? Kay: You gotta hear this! It really grinds my gears! Nicole: Yes, yes? Edgeworth: ...Kay. Please just leave it at that. Unless you want to make tomorrow morning's headlines. Kay: Ah! That was close... Nicole: Aww, shucks. Don't be such a stick in the mud... What's wrong with lettin' a gal open her heart and spill the beans? Edgeworth: (For now, I'll turn the bug off.) Bug data jotted down in my Organizer. Nicole: So... did ya find the kidnappers? Edgeworth: Ms. Swift. Was the boy you saw being kidnapped... ...this boy in the photo? Nicole: Hmm? Nope, they ain't nothin' alike. He had a more stupid-lookin' face, and was wearin' a collared school uniform... Kay: I thought so... Edgeworth: (Yet again, we were led astray by this woman's testimony...) We will have to conduct our investigation all over again. So, we're back where we started. Are there any new leads...? (There's only 20 minutes left until 2 o'clock! Will we be able to make it in time...?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Mr. Edgeworth! About that phone call just now... Wasn't there a strange sound at the end? Edgeworth: A strange sound...? Edgeworth: Don't think you can get away with this. ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: Now that you mention it... It sounded like an explosion (Sound of an explosion - Sound of an explosion was heard during the call from the kidnapper.). It might be a hint to establish the culprit's whereabouts... Nicole: Mm-hmm. I see, I see. The sound of an explosion, eh? Edgeworth: Hmph! I would appreciate it if you stopped eavesdropping on us! Nicole: Mr. Prosecutor... Yer as stingy as ever. Edgeworth: (...First, let's see what she has to say...) (Clearing all \"Talk\" options of Nicole leads to:) Nicole's Tape Recorder data jotted down in my Organizer. ???: Mr. Edgewooooorth! Edgeworth: Mr. Saint, Ms. Berry! Simeon: D-Did you find him? Kay: Not yet. Just where could Shaun be...? Simeon: Shaun? Kay: Ah! No, no! It's nothing! Don't worry about it. Edgeworth: (They don't know anything about the kidnapping.) Regarding Sebastian, we found him not too long ago. Simeon: Really!? That's great! Thank you so much! Now I won't be arrested again. Edgeworth: Based on the explosion sound we heard from the kidnapper's phone... ...we know that Shaun is being confined some place in the vicinity of the Coliseum. Kay: One of the garbage dumps is right next to the Coliseum! Edgeworth: Shaun was almost certainly taken there. In which case... the place he is being confined to must also be somewhere close by. Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Could I ask you to search the area around this garbage dump? Gumshoe: .....You don't have to ask me like we're strangers, sir! It feels... so distant. ...Please just order me around like you normally do. Edgeworth: Are you sure, Detective? Right now I'm not a prosecutor. Gumshoe: Didn't I tell you, sir? Detectives don't just investigate for the sake of prosecutors! Edgeworth: ...You have my thanks, Detective. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth. Look. It's almost time...! Edgeworth: Yes. It would be best if we hurry. They should also be at their limit. Detective Gumshoe, I'm counting on you! Gumshoe: Leave it to me, sir! This may be an unofficial investigation... ...but I'll call in all of my pals from the station to help! Kay: I'll help too! Stealing Shaun back is my job, after all! Edgeworth: I'll be returning to the courtroom. I might be able to draw out some more time. Kay: Oookay! Well then! Even in the depths of... night... Edgeworth: Hmm. The clock just struck 2...! We have to hurry! Gumshoe: Yessir! Kay: Aaah, my introduction! ...When no other bird dares to take fliiight... Blaise: Well, well, well. If it isn't former Prosecutor Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (Blaise Debeste...!) Franziska: Witness! Face forward! We're not done talking yet! Blaise: Like I said, y'see. Why exactly would I have needed to help that person out, Your Honor? Blaise: Y'know, it's a crying shame. Having a beautiful woman declared guilty. Honestly, it brings tears to my eyes. But y'see, there's no reason for me to go out of my way to hide evidence just to save her. Franziska: Franziska: However, we still have the testimony of your son, Prosecutor Debeste! He testified that he handed the evidence over to you! Blaise: Hmm. Well, I haven't the slightest clue what he was talking about. I simply can't imagine why Sebastian would have said something like that, y'know. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What if there is evidence that shows your connection with Warden Laguarde? Blaise: Hm? And just what do you think you're doing, \"Former\" Prosecutor Edgeworth? I was under the impression that you were no longer in any position to stand in court? Franziska: Miles Edgeworth! How dare you barge into my prosecutor's bench... Edgeworth: Franziska. I'm sorry. I need you to lend me the bench for a little while. Franziska: Wh-What are you saying...!? Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! I've brought vital evidence related to this case. Your Honor, please allow me to testify! Gravelle: ........ Blaise: Hah hah hah! She'd never allow it! Ray: Ray: Gravelle-pie. Uncle Ray also asks that he be allowed to testify. There are no objections from the prosecution either, right? Franziska: .......... Understood. The prosecution also has no objections. Blaise: Blaise: There's no way you can allow something like this, y'know. Such high-handed methods... ...surely are enough to warrant being held in contempt of court. Wouldn't y'say, Gravelle? Gravelle: ........ Edgeworth: (Ngh! As long as Shaun is still in danger... ...Judge Gravelle cannot rule against the warden. I must convey to her somehow that the search for her son is progressing!) Judge Gravelle. I ask that you have faith in me and my assistant. Franziska: Now that you mention it, where exactly is she...? Edgeworth: She is currently out searching for the most important piece of evidence. Blaise: Blaise: It's a waste of time. There's no such evidence. Are you stalling for time? How disgraceful. Ray: Ray: Most important piece of evidence, huh? ...Gravelle-pie. I don't really know what that evidence is, but I think we should have faith in her. After all, even if she may not look like it, she's still the Great Thief Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: (Somehow... it seems that Mr. Shields understands.) Judge Gravelle! We've already determined the general location of that evidence. It's only a matter of time before she steals the evidence back. Gravelle: ! ......I understand. Then I shall give you special permission to testify. Edgeworth: ...Thank you, Your Honor. Blaise: This is ridiculous! Gravelle: This vital evidence that you have found... Please present it to the court! Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste and Fifi Laguarde are somehow connected. Allow me to present the evidence that proves it! (Which piece of evidence shows the relationship between Fifi Laguarde and Blaise Debeste?) Edgeworth: This document contains a detailed report regarding the interrogation of a certain man. Ray: A certain man? Edgeworth: That man being the late Horace Knightley. And, the one who interrogated him was the defendant in this trial, Fifi Laguarde. Ray: ! So that means, that was the interrogation where... Edgeworth: That's right... Fifi Laguarde murdered Knightley in the aftermath of the interrogation. And that very interrogation has been recorded in this written report! Gravelle: That... definitely sounds like vital evidence! Franziska: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. Just now, you referred to that document as a \"written report\". Now, just who in the world was that report written for? Edgeworth: I thought you might ask that, Franziska. And that's precisely what is most important about this report...! We found this document inside the safe in the storeroom on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower. Franziska: The 51st floor... The storeroom for the black market auction! Edgeworth: Indeed. And the Conductor of the auction was you, Blaise Debeste! Blaise: ............ Edgeworth: You received a report about the victim from Warden Laguarde! In the face of this evidence, can you still say you have no connection to this case? Blaise: ......In regards to that, I refuse to answer. Edgeworth: What? Blaise: It has yet to be proven in court that I was the Conductor of the black market auction. Edgeworth: Oh? Have you already forgotten the events of this morning? I believe I had already proved it back then, did I not? Blaise: I will not deny that I was bested by you. However, that was at the crime scene. Who knows if the results will be the same in court. An acquittal is still possible, y'see. ...Until it's been proven in court that I am the Conductor of the black market auctions... ...you can't prove that document was addressed to me. Edgeworth: Your logic is twisted...! Blaise: That's not very nice, y'know. My logic isn't twisted, is it? Gravelle? Don't you feel the same way? It was quite unlike you to allow Former Prosecutor Edgeworth's statement just now, y'know. ...It saddens me, y'see. That you would fail to uphold the law as a judge should. In fact, I'm so upset by this, I may have no other choice but to use my last resort, y'know. Gravelle: .....I-It is as you say. Something that has not been proven in court does not merit any deliberation. I will have to... overrule... Mr. Edgeworth's claim. Edgeworth: (Ngh... As I thought, until Shaun has been rescued...) Blaise: Y'see? The truth at the scene and the truth in the courtroom are two very different things. Edgeworth: So, you're saying the truth can be distorted in court, as long as it's for your sake? Blaise: What a horrible thing to say. I'm not distorting the truth or anything like that, y'know. If a not guilty verdict is handed down, then that becomes the truth. That's all it is, y'see. Edgeworth: (It's useless. There's nothing we can do useless the missing evidence turns up...) Blaise: Now then, Gravelle. Why don't you deliver a Not Guilty verdict and let's get this over with? After all, that evidence... isn't gonna show up any time soon, y'know. ???: Gravelle: Wh-Who raised an objection just now? Debeste: ...P-Pops... Blaise: .....Sebastian. Debeste: ......Uugh. Blaise: Why did you come back here, now of all times? Gravelle: Sebastian! What is the meaning of this? Franziska: Just where were you and what have been doing since you abandoned your own trial? Debeste: I-I'm sorry. I was... umm... Franziska: Such an act is unbecoming of a prosecutor! You should be ashamed! Debeste: I... umm... well... Blaise: Sebastian. You still don't get it, y'know. This court has no place for sniveling child such as yourself! Debeste: .....Pops.....! I...... I...! I-I've come to present new evidence, Your Honor! So, so... please! Let me take my place back at the prosecutor's bench! Edgeworth: (Sebastian...! I didn't think he would come back...) Blaise: Blaise: Hah hah hah hah! What's all this now, Sebastian? You don't seem at all like your normal self! Debeste: ........Uugh. Pops... Blaise: Hm? Come now! What's the matter? You want Daddy to play with you? Is that it? Well then, why don't we just head on back home. Debeste: R-Return to the witness stand. Blaise: What's wrong? You're shaking like a leaf. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor! The prosecutor officially in charge of this case has just arrived with new evidence. The trial is still in session. In light of this, shouldn't we continue with the proceedings? Gravelle: ........ Ray: Naturally, the defense has no objections, Your Honor. I'm sure the defense attorney originally in charge would say the same. Franziska: .....The prosecution has no objections, either, Your Honor. Gravelle: .......... Blaise: Continue with the proceedings? That won't be necessary. Isn't that right? Gravelle. Edgeworth: (Blaise still believes that he was the one who kidnapped Shaun. As long as Shaun still hasn't been found... ...Judge Gravelle will remain bound by Blaise, and nothing else will change that!) Gravelle: .......... Th-That sound is... Edgeworth: (Her cell phone...!) Hm...! (My phone as well...?) Ray: Eh? Uncle Ray's phone is also...! Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! Kay: Mr. Shields! Gumshoe: We've found Shaun, sir! Kay: We rescued Shaun! Edgeworth: Excellent work, Detective! Ray: That kid was the most important piece of evidence, right? Way to go, Kay! Kay: Eheheh! I wanted to spread the word quickly, so I had everyone call! Edgeworth: .....Judge Gravelle. It's for you. Gravelle: ..... Gravelle: .......Yes. I see. I'm..... I'm so glad you're safe...! Make sure you properly thank everyone. OK? ............Be careful, and come home safe. Gravelle: ...Let us resume the proceedings. Now that I may once again swing my gabel to my heart's content. Blaise: Hah...! You're kidding, right? This is just a sad joke, y'know! Gravelle: Witness! This is no joke! Please return to the stand! Prosecutor Debeste, as well. Promptly return to your seat at the prosecutor's bench! Debeste: Y-Yes, Your Honor! Franziska: ........Sebastian Debeste. Debeste: Y-Yes, Ms. von Karma...!? Franziska: .....I leave the rest to you. Debeste: Huh...? Franziska: \"Going up against your own father...\" It won't be easy. I shall observe how things pan out... from the gallery. Gravelle: Now then, allow me to ask once more... Is the prosecution ready? Prosecutor Debeste. What is this new evidence you wish to present...? Debeste: .....The missing knife and chisel, Your Honor. Ray: You mean they've finally been found!? Gravelle: Prosecutor Debeste! Is this true!? Debeste: ...Th-The knife and chisel... I wasn't able to find them... I searched and searched! I really did! But... it was already too late... Edgeworth: (Too late...?) Ray: What do you mean? Debeste: I remembered... This morning, when I passed by Pops in the garage at home... ...he was holding something wrapped in a newspaper. Debeste: Pops, where are you going? Blaise: Ah, Sebastian. Just taking out some trash. Debeste: At that moment, I heard it. .....The faint sound of a bell. Ray: Could that sound have been, by any chance... Edgeworth: ...the bell attached to Kanis's chisel!? Gravelle: In other words... you're saying that the witness threw away the evidence? Blaise: ........ Debeste: I searched for it, but I didn't make it in time. I'm sorry... Ray: Where exactly did you search for it? Debeste: The garbage dump! I went to the garbage dump and searched everywhere! I thought the evidence Pops threw away had to be there...! Edgeworth: Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?) Kay: Ah! What're you doing here? Debeste: WHOOOOOOOAAAHH! Kay: H-He ignored us... Edgeworth: (So at that time, he had gone to the garbage dump...) Debeste: But... but... ...this was all I could find. Gravelle: This is...? It smells rather peculiar... Ray: Now that you mention it, there's kind of a funky smell coming from you as well... Debeste: Wh-What do you expect!? I was digging through garbage! Edgeworth: And what of the knife? Debeste: I think it's buried somewhere in that giant mountain of trash... ...but I couldn't find it by myself. Gravelle: ...I understand. I shall accept this into evidence. Blaise: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Well done, Sebastian! You never betray my expectations, y'know! You searched so desperately through the garbage and that's all you have to show for it? Debeste: Urk...! Blaise: Awww, what a tear-jerker! I'm tearing up already! Ray: Ray: It's a bit too early for tears, don't you think? We haven't examined the evidence properly yet. Blaise: ...I think it's just a pointless waste of time, y'know. Ray: I'm counting on you. Sebastian, Miles. Show him that the truth can be exposed in court and take him down! Edgeworth: (Mr. Shields is backing us up. Now all we need is a breakthrough...!) Prosecutor Debeste. Let's take a closer look at the evidence. Debeste: R... Right! Edgeworth: Let's have a look inside. (It'd be great if we could find some kind of proof.) This is... the bell that was attached to Kanis's chisel... Are there any traces left behind on it? Debeste: .....Ack, it's no good. There's not even a single smudge on it... Gravelle: What did you find, Prosecutor Debeste!? Blaise: Did you even find anything? Debeste: D... Darn it... Blaise: Of course you'd find nothing. Something like that can't be called evidence, y'know. All it is, is trash. It may be sad, but that's the truth, y'see. Edgeworth: (Were Sebastian's efforts all for naught...?) Indeed, this bell does not seem to be valid evidence... (However...) Debeste: Mr. Edgeworth! Are you really giving up!? Blaise: Calm as always, Edgeworth. Quite unlike Sebastian here! Gravelle: ...Well then, is the prosecution finished with its argument? Debeste: Debeste: Verity, not yet! We're not through yet! There's still something we haven't examined! Blaise: You're still not giving up? Struggling in vain's not cute at all, y'know. Edgeworth: (It seems Sebastian hasn't given up yet either. I was just thinking the exact same thing. The last item remaining... Is it trash, or is it evidence...? If we don't examine it, we'll never find out... The item I'm thinking of is...) Debeste: We're still not done examining the newspaper that the bell was wrapped in! Edgeworth: (It seems that Sebastian has the same idea as I do.) Blaise: Wow, this is just wonderful, y'know. So wonderful, it's to cry for. Is it desperation, or simply reckless abandon? Are you really going to... pin all your hopes on a worthless scrap of newspaper? Edgeworth: Heh. We won't know for sure whether or not it's \"worthless\" until we examine it, will we? Sebastian. Let's examine it posthaste. Edgeworth: Is this... a handprint? Debeste: ! There's something greasy on here too... Is it oil? Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle! We'd like to request a fingerprint analysis on this paper! Could you please summon someone from forensics? Gravelle: Your request is accepted. Contact the lab at once! Forensics: Reporting! These are definitely fingerprints! However... it's from a glove! Debeste: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!? Blaise: Didn't I tell you? It's nothing but a worthless scrap of paper. Just thinking about it, y'know. When handling important evidence... ...what kind of idiot wouldn't use gloves!? Oh wait, wouldn't that be you? The idiot who doesn't know when to give up. Ray: ...That's pretty harsh, talking to your son like that. Blaise: What's wrong with calling an idiot an idiot? If you want to be The Best, you have to be heartless. I have no compassion worthless individuals, not even my own son! Debeste: Pops...! I.....! Blaise: Y'know, you've always called yourself a genius prosecutor, haven't you? Didn't I explain to you this morning why you were a genius up until now? That's right. It was all because of me. Because of my authority. You were always being protected. By people like Gravelle... and me. Debeste: ........Uuunghh. Blaise: Now, get that stinking face of yours out of my sight. Debeste: Stinking... Blaise: Y'know, now that I think about it, that stench might just suit you perfectly. Just keep it away from my nose, or my eyes will start watering. Debeste: Debeste: Wrong... You're wrong, Pops. Blaise: ...Sebastian? What are you talking about? Debeste: ...You're the one who stinks, Pops. It's you, not me! Blaise: What...? Debeste: ...You haven't noticed, have you? You smell, Pops. So much that you can't even hide it. Mr. Edgeworth... Try smelling the hand print on the newspaper. Edgeworth: The smell...? ...Hmm. It smells... like oil... Debeste: I know something that smells just like it... Edgeworth: (Come to think of it, back then...) Edgeworth: (It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.) Debeste: That's right... The smell proves it. It proves that the culprit who hid the evidence was...! It's no good... I guess I can't become the best after all. I'm too soft... I could never be so heartless... ...I just can't bring down my father with my own hands. Edgeworth: (Prosecutor Debeste...) ..........Summon... your courage. \"Become a different prosecutor from your father\"... Wasn't that what you decided? Debeste: ! Edgeworth: We are prosecutors. And as prosecutors, we stand in the courtroom. In that case, isn't it our duty to shed light on the truth? Debeste: ........ Edgeworth: Exposing crimes and bringing criminals to justice. Even if the criminal is your own father... ...that is your duty, as a prosecutor. Didn't I promise you? That if you have the courage to stand up... I will show you the way. And if you cannot do it alone, then we shall do it together... Debeste: ...Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Allow me to present the evidence that connects this hand print with my father! Edgeworth: This is the smell of motor oil. The kind used for maintaining motorcycles... Debeste: Both myself and Mr. Edgeworth have smelled this exact same smell before! Edgeworth: Blaise Debeste! It was in your garage! Blaise: ! Edgeworth: And wouldn't you say these fingerprints have a rather peculiar shape? The five letters that spell out D-E-A-T-H. It's exactly the same as your own gloves. Blaise: Blaise: Ha ha ha! You can buy gloves like that from anywhere! It doesn't prove a thing! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is that really the case? Debeste: That's not the only thing that these two pieces of evidence have in common! Edgeworth: (The fingerprints on the newspaper that was used to wrap up the bell... ...and Blaise's mechanic's gloves...) This is the unmistakable similarity they both share! Edgeworth: If you examine the imprint left by the letter A, you'll see it's unmistakably from this glove. Blaise: Whaaaaaaaaat!? Edgeworth: And that's not all... There is one more item we must take note of. Namely, these dirt stains. I suggest we do a comparative analysis of the dirt stains from the newspaper and the glove. If the contents match up... then it will prove to be decisive evidence. Gravelle: Bailiff! Please have these dirt samples sent to forensics for analysis immediately! Blaise: Gaaaaaaaarrgh! Edgewooorth! Sebastiaaaan! You lowly prosecutors! Do you have any idea who I am!? Debeste: Pops... you can't run away anymore. It's been proven in court that you concealed the evidence. And that you tried to cover for the defendant... Blaise: Y-You're saying that I'm... Guilty? That I'll be sent to prison...? Me, Blaise Debeste? A couple of snot-nosed punks are gonna make me disappear!? There must be some mistake! Debeste: Debeste: Be a man and admit your crimes! Blaise: Blaise: Do you really think you can survive if I'm not around? Debeste: I..... I'll be fine now. I thought I wanted to be the best prosecutor, so I could get your approval, Pops. But, when I was kidnapped by your men... and stuck in that dark room, I started thinking. \"I am... truly powerless.\" I despaired, and averted my eyes from the truth. But... ...at that moment, Mr. Edgeworth stepped in and showed me the way. And now, I am no longer just a child chasing after his father's approval! I've become capable... I can find evidence on my own now! Blaise: Wha... My men kidnapped you? Why were you...!? Debeste: Debeste: Pops, I'll show you the truth you never knew... through this trial. Blaise: Sebastiaaan! How dare you speak to me like that...! You should've just stayed as an idiot son! Debeste: You may have hated me to the very end, Pops... ...but I... I've always looked up to you. Thank you for everything up until now. .....And goodbye. Blaise: You... Since when did you... All you've ever been able to do was depend on me! SebaSTIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNN! Gravelle: It has been established that the evidence was concealed by Blaise Debeste himself. A judgment regarding his concealment of evidence shall be delivered at a separate trial. The missing chisel and knife still have yet to be found. However, once a search of the waste disposal site is underway, they will surely be discovered. Laguarde: ...The knife will be found? Wh-What will happen to me if it's found? Edgeworth: Heh. No need to worry. You'll simply receive the punishment you deserve for your crime. Laguarde: Grrrr! Punishment? For me!? Blaise, what in the world are you doing!? You! You... After all your boasting about being able to create your own truths and Not Guilty verdicts! That's why I contacted you immediately after the prison incident in the first place! And to make matters worse, you even kidnapped the wrong kid! I just can't believe this! You really, really, really are... completely useleeeeeessss! Edgeworth: ...That was certainly a violent outburst. But you heard her, Prosecutor Debeste. Debeste: Yeah. She got flustered and said a bunch of important stuff! ...Right? Edgeworth: Indeed... That's correct. (He still doesn't seem very sure of himself...) Gravelle: Very well. And with that, this court is adjourned. ???: Edgeworth: What? Franziska: Huh!? Gravelle: Wh-Who are you? Lang: Judge Gravelle. It's still too early for a happy ending. Lang Zi says: \"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case.\" Gravelle: And who... might you be? Lang: The name's Shi-Long Lang. I'm just a humble, lone investigator. Gravelle: Do you have some objection with this trial? Lang: Hah! Not a chance! The defendant there has a heart as black as a moonless night. Laguarde: Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...? Lang: You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree? Edgeworth: Agent Lang. What are you talking about? Lang: The SS-5 Incident from 12 years ago... It's a case I'll never forget. Edgeworth: (12 years ago...?) Lang: ......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa. Edgeworth: (12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?) Edgeworth: (Might it have something to do with Lang's father and President Huang?) Lang: Fifi Laguarde. And you, Blaise Debeste. Back then, the two of you killed off the Lang clan... Laguarde: Rrgh... Gravelle: Were you involved in the incident 12 years ago? Lang: That's right, I was. However... I'm not here to chase after ghosts of the past. I'm here for you, Verity Gravelle...! Gravelle: M... Me? Lang: You, and one other... Shaun: .......... Gravelle: Shaun! Lang: Ms. Gravelle! You're coming along too! As a suspect in the murder of the president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang! What evidence do you...!? Lang: Lang: Settle down, Mr. Prosecutor. The investigation has only just begun. We're going to inspect the crime scene with the suspects in attendance. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang... did he get his hands on some new pieces of evidence?) Lang: If you have any objections, then you can tag along as well. Edgeworth: ...I shall do just that. Shaun: ........ Edgeworth: (\"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case\"... There are still many mysteries yet unsolved surrounding the murder of the president... Namely, the true nature of the \"giant monster\", and...) ???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that. Edgeworth: (The true identity of the person on the other end of the phone...) To be continued. \n-- Shaun's Rehearsal -- Shaun: I wasn't feeling too great during yesterday's shoot, so I made a few bloopers. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. You said you didn't feel well. Could you tell me more concretely what was wrong? Shaun: That doesn't matter! I just wasn't feeling well, alright!? Kay: You weren't feeling well... Maybe you drank too much milk? Shaun: Wha... How'd you...!? Ah, no, I mean, that's not it... Edgeworth: (So he didn't feel well because of his stomach...) Kay: When I was young, I was told that chewing milk makes it easier on your stomach, y'know? Shaun: Th-This conversation is over! Anyways, I made a few bloopers. Shaun: They're reshooting the scene today, so... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So they planned to reshoot the scene today. And you were practicing for that last night. Shaun: ...My mistakes caused a lot of trouble for the people around me. I'm a pro, so practicing that much more is natural. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He certainly does have an admirable sense of responsibility.) Penny: Shaun is incredibly dedicated to his craft. He didn't even make any major mistakes in those bloopers. But he said if it would make the movie just a tiny bit better... Shaun: Shut up! You don't need to go around blabbering about stupid stuff like that! Penny: Ah... I-I'm sorry. Edgeworth: (If only he was a little more cooperative, I'd have no complaints.) Shaun: Hmph... Anyway, that's what happened. Shaun: Well, I decided to rehearse a little on my own. That's all. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. About your testimony just now... Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Don't I always tell you!? If you're going to practice by yourself, you have to let me know beforehand! Shaun: I-I-I know! Edgeworth: (...My time to speak was completely stolen away from me.) I shall ask you once more. Shaun, about your testimony just now... Kay: But you know, Shaun, I think that's really great! Edgeworth: (Mmph... A-Again!?) Kay: I bet putting in an honest effort like that will make someone even more talented. You'll go from a little thief to a Middle Thief, and then someday you'll become a Great Thief! I'll be doing my best, so you do your best too! OK, Shaun? Edgeworth: ........Ahem. Now then, if I may? Shaun. Do you often rehearse in that way? (At last... At long last, I finally got to ask my question...!) Shaun: I do it all the time. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There are no mistakes in that testimony, correct? Shaun: O-Of course there's no mistakes! It was just a normal, peaceful night! Nothing out of the ordinary happened at all! Kay: A... A peaceful night!? How can you say that when an incident like this has occurred!? Edgeworth: Kay, he is still a child. Please don't get seriously angry. Present Moozilla's Head Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that? Shaun: ...! I don't know anything about it. Edgeworth: Is that true? Shaun: I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something? Edgeworth: (...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after Shaun had already gone back...) Shaun: If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We're not done talking yet! Shaun: What now? Edgeworth: The falling monster's head wasn't the only unusual thing that happened last night. And this is something you should be well aware of. What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling? Present Monster's Footprints or Shaun's Practice Video Edgeworth: Leads to: \"We have evidence right here.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. Take a look at this. Shaun: And what's that supposed to be? Edgeworth: Don't you understand? This shows what happened last night. Shaun: ...... Edgeworth: Hmph... Have I left you speechless? Shaun: ...You're so far off the mark that I have nothing to say. Edgeworth: Argh! (Was I really that far off...?) Kay: Let's review what happened here last night one more time! Edgeworth: Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer! Kay: Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night? Leads back to: \"What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling?\" Edgeworth: We have evidence right here. Shaun: Ah! Could that be...!? Edgeworth: That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance. Shaun: ........Ugh. Lang: What!? You're telling me you have video from last night!? Edgeworth: Exactly. And in this video... ...there is clearly something that is out of the ordinary. Lang: Th-This is... a monster's footprint...! Edgeworth: Would you say that monster's footprints are commonplace on a film set? Gravelle: Shaun... Why did you conceal this video from us? Shaun: ........No reason, really. Lang: Lang: Hey, pup! This is no joking matter! You had a reason to hide it, right? Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Answer him clearly! Shaun: But Mom..... Edgeworth: Well? Shaun: ...I didn't want anyone to see me rehearsing. Lang: ........ Kay: ........ Edgeworth: ........ In other words, you're embarrassed about others seeing you practice. Shaun: ...Yeah. Got a problem with that!? Lang: Lang: You're saying that's why you hid the evidence? Gravelle: Shaun! Shaun: Eep! ...Quit nagging me. You've already busted me, what more do you want? Yeah, the footprints were there, but I just practiced and headed home. Lotta: How come yer so calm after findin' those footprints!? It's a monster, ya know!? A real live monster! Shaun: ...I thought it was just a part of the set. Besides, there's lots of other weird stuff around here too. Nicole: He's suspicious, Chief! This kid's really suspicious! Lotta: Yer right! The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven! Shaun: ...Shut up. We're done talking! Lang: Leads to: \"Wait up...\" Present Monster's Footprints or Shaun's Practice Video Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? We have evidence right here. Shaun: Ah! Could that be...!? Edgeworth: That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance. Shaun: ........Ugh. Lang: What!? You're telling me you have video from last night!? Edgeworth: Exactly. And in this video... ...there is clearly something that is out of the ordinary. Lang: Th-This is... a monster's footprint...! Edgeworth: Would you say that monster's footprints are commonplace on a film set? Gravelle: Shaun... Why did you conceal this video from us? Shaun: ........No reason, really. Lang: Lang: Hey, pup! This is no joking matter! You had a reason to hide it, right? Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! Answer him clearly! Shaun: But Mom..... Edgeworth: Well? Shaun: ...I didn't want anyone to see me rehearsing. Lang: ........ Kay: ........ Edgeworth: ........ In other words, you're embarrassed about others seeing you practice. Shaun: ...Yeah. Got a problem with that!? Lang: Lang: You're saying that's why you hid the evidence? Gravelle: Shaun! Shaun: Eep! ...Quit nagging me. You've already busted me, what more do you want? Yeah, the footprints were there, but I just practiced and headed home. Lotta: How come yer so calm after findin' those footprints!? It's a monster, ya know!? A real live monster! Shaun: ...I thought it was just a part of the set. Besides, there's lots of other weird stuff around here too. Nicole: He's suspicious, Chief! This kid's really suspicious! Lotta: Yer right! The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven! Shaun: ...Shut up. We're done talking! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: We're not done here yet! Shaun: What now? Edgeworth: The monster's footprints weren't the only unusual things that happened last night. Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night? Present Moozilla's Head Edgeworth: Leads to: \"A monster's head fell from the roof of that building.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This shows what happened here yesterday. Shaun: ...And just what exactly does it show? Edgeworth: You don't understand, do you? You are still a child, after all. Shaun: I don't need some guy who's less intelligent than a child telling me that. Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (It seems that wasn't it...) Kay: Let's review what happened here last night one more time! Edgeworth: Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer! Kay: Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night? Leads back to: \"Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night?\" Edgeworth: A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that? Shaun: ...! I don't know anything about it. Edgeworth: Is that true? Shaun: I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something? Edgeworth: (...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after Shaun had already gone back...) Shaun: If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking! Edgeworth: (It seems that Shaun doesn't really want to talk about last night. Could he be hiding something after all...?) Leads to: \"Wait up...\" Edgeworth: So there was nothing out of the ordinary...? Kay: He doesn't know anything at all about the incident. That's the impression I'm getting. But isn't there evidence that shows something did happen last night? Edgeworth: Yes... I don't have time to waste dealing with a child's lies. Let's present the contradiction. Lang: Wait up... Edgeworth: ? Agent Lang? Lang: Heh heh heh. It's as I thought. Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. This video backs up my logic. Kay: Huh!? Is there something in the video that's related to the case? Lang: Yeah... Take a good, hard look at the monster costume in the top-left. Kay: The Moozilla costume...? Lang: Try comparing it with the one over there right now. Kay: Hmm? It looks like it's just hanging there limply though. And the zipper on its back is zipped up tightly. Edgeworth: (Zipper on its back...?) Wha! (Th-This discrepancy is...!) Lang: Yeah. The difference is plain to see. In the video, the zipper is clearly open! That's right... Someone was inside. Kay: WHAAAAAAAT! Edgeworth: Mr. Powers! Is the costume's zipper usually...? Powers: It's always zipped up tightly when it's not in use... Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. Do you remember? My logic from before... Lang: Two nights ago, Gravelle pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body. Edgeworth: In here? Lang: Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Edgeworth: You're saying the body... was hidden inside the costume? Lang: Yeah, that's right! Judge Gravelle! Two nights ago, you pushed the president off the roof of the tower. You then hid the body inside the monster costume! Gravelle: I... I did no such thing! Lang: Lang: Say what you want, but you're the only one who could've done it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That should have already been proven impossible. The film lot was locked at the time! Judge Gravelle could not have entered this place! Lang: Lang: ...And what if there was an accomplice? Edgeworth: What? Lang: I'll tell you my reasoning, so listen up. -- Mother and Son Theory -- Lang: When the president was pushed off the roof, Shaun was waiting at the film lot. If Shaun was an accomplice, the problem with the locks would be resolved. The two of them then hid the president's body. Inside that monster costume over there... Edgeworth: You think this crime had such an elaborate plan? Lang: To take the life of a nation's president. An elaborate plan is to be expected, don't you think? Gravelle: Gravelle: Shaun would never... take part in such a crime! Lang: Lang: You're the one being suspected. Your words don't carry much weight! Edgeworth: I wouldn't think those two had sufficient motive for something like this, though? Lang: Well, maybe they had a motive that we didn't know about? You were the last one to meet with the president. And you're still keeping the details secret. Don't you think it's only natural that you're being suspected? Gravelle: ...... Edgeworth: Judge Gravelle. Is there no way for you to tell us your secret. Gravelle: M-My apologies. I just cannot, no matter what... However, when the time I can talk about it comes, I will surely let you know. So, if you could please... Lang: Believe you? Is that what you wanted to say? That's what all criminals say. And you, pup... If you've got an explanation, hurry up and spit it out. Shaun: Hmph. I didn't do nothing. ...That's all I'm saying. Lang: Both mother and son won't talk. You still gonna defend 'em like this? Edgeworth: It's true, Judge Gravelle's actions are a mystery... ...however, we still don't know whether or not that ties in with a motive for murder. Lang: Yeah, that's right. Their motive for murder can wait. For now, let's talk about the situation surrounding the crime. ...And the fact that these two are the only ones who could've done it! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang. Don't tell me you're saying Shaun was an accomplice? Kay: Shaun still looks like a grade school kid, he's even got a kiddy backpack to boot! How could he be an accomplice...? There's just no way! Penny: Like I said, Shaun's already in middle school, and the backpack is a part of his costume... Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says! \"No matter how young the cub, never pity an ungrateful pup.\" He may be a little brat, but a villain deserves no mercy. Kay: Uuuh... So Mr. Lang Zi didn't make any allowances for age... Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. You're not just defending him 'cause he's a pup, are you? Edgeworth: Hmph. Of course, that was never my intention. I shall present suitable evidence in due course. Lang: Oh? I'm looking forward to it. My logic's just getting started. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How would that... resolve the problem!? Lang: I figured you'd ask that, Mr. Prosecutor. But y'know, it's actually quite simple. Listen up... First, that woman pushes the president off the roof. Kay: Hmm... she pushes him off. Lang: Then, that brat, who knew the combination for the lock, unlocks the film lot. Kay: I see... the combination unlocks the brat! Edgeworth: Kay, it's the opposite. Lang: ...That's all it takes. With this, the problem of the lock is solved. Your theory that she couldn't get in because she didn't know the combination no longer files! Edgeworth: (Hmm... Regarding the lock, that certainly is a plausible explanation...) Agent Lang. Thank you for your clear explanation. Please, continue with what you were saying before. Lang: Hmph. If you're gonna give up, you better do it now. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Supposing those two were accomplices... Why would they have needed to leave the body hanging there for an entire day!? Lang: Lang: Why don't you give it a rest, and take a good hard look at reality. Thanks to their trickery, our investigation has been confused up until now. Doesn't that about answer your question!? ...Got it? Those two hid the body. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In the video, we cannot see the inside of the costume. So can you really say for certain that the body was placed inside? Lang: ...Yeah, I'll give you that much. In that case, why don't we try examining it? The inside of that costume! There might be some traces left inside. Edgeworth: Mr. Powers, may we examine the inside of the costume? Powers: Sure. Go ahead. But it might be kinda stinky, since I sweat a lot in here... Edgeworth: This is... incredibly dirty. Powers: That's strange... We always make sure to clean it after using it, so that the sweat doesn't damage the costume. Lang: Lang: Isn't this just proof that someone besides you used this costume? I'd say that dirt from the body probably got into the costume. Kay: The president's body did fall on top of the monster's footprint. That must be where the dirt came from! Lang: ...Are you satisfied now? Add statement: \"There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, dirt got into the costume when the body was hidden inside. Wouldn't that mean... ...that the dirt was transferred from the body? Lang: Hah! Isn't that obvious? How else would you say it got there? Kay: ...There's dirt stuck everywhere inside the costume. It looks particularly bad around the chest area. Edgeworth: (Dirt around the chest...? We cannot overlook this fact.) Kay: Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense... Edgeworth: Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point. Kay: In that case, what should we do? Edgeworth: Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail.

Present Crime Scene Notes Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it...\" Kay: Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense... Edgeworth: Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point. Kay: In that case, what should we do? Edgeworth: Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail. Let's draw out more information. Edgeworth: Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it... Is that really the case? Lang: You have a problem with that? Edgeworth: There is a fair amount of dirt inside the front of the costume. Kay: Yeah, that IS a lot of dirt... Edgeworth: However, I would like you to focus on the state the body is in. It's lying on top of the dirt, and yet there's no dirt on the front of the body. If the body really was inside the costume... ...then it's strange that the front of the body isn't stained with more dirt! Lang: Rrgh! Well then, how would you explain it? How did the dirt get inside the costume!? Edgeworth: (From the video footage, it's very likely that someone was inside the costume. But just who could it have been...?) Kay: Hmm... Where have I seen this? Edgeworth: What's the matter, Kay? Kay: I just feel like I remember seeing something that looked like this dirt somewhere before... ...but where was it? There were these bits of gray fragments mixed in with the dirt. Edgeworth: (Gray... fragments? There does seem to be something other than normal dirt mixed into it...) Kay: Something must've gotten stuck to it, and lots of it I might add. Hmm... Edgeworth: (Something got stuck to it? This may merit a closer look. Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?) Present Mechanic's Gloves Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is what you're thinking of, isn't it, Kay? Kay: Oh! Mr. Edgeworth, you sure are sharp! Edgeworth: Hmph... Naturally. Kay: ...But too bad! Not this time! Edgeworth: Argh! (You should have just said that in the first place!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, can't you remember? Dirt, dirt... Where else did we see this dirt? Edgeworth: (Dirt... Wasn't there a piece of evidence that had dirt on it?) Kay: It's on the tip of my brain, but I just can't quite place it. Where on earth have we seen dirt like this before? Leads back to: \"(Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?)\" Edgeworth: This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it. Lang: Huh? And what of it? Edgeworth: We found an item belonging to a certain man, that was covered in the same type of dirt. That is to say, these gloves. Lang: Those dirt stains... certainly look the same. But, tell me... Just what exactly is this grey substance!? Edgeworth: This grey substance is... Plastic Edgeworth: Yes, I believe it's plastic. Your thoughts? Lang: Lang: Hah! You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Prosecutor! Put more \"BANG!\" into your claims, like you usually do! Edgeworth: Ah... Hmm. Lang: As for my opinion on the matter... I'll tell you right now, that stuff is definitely not plastic! Edgeworth: Nngwaaah! (So that wasn't it...) Kay: Let's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it? Edgeworth: Right. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally. Leads back to: \"This grey substance is...\" Concrete Leads to: \"This grey substance must be fragments of concrete.\" Paint Edgeworth: No matter how you look at it, this must be paint! Lang: Lang: Mr. Prosecutor! When did you become so scatterbrained!? No matter how you look at it, this doesn't look like paint! Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (I suppose not...) Kay: Let's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it? Edgeworth: Right. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally. Leads back to: \"This grey substance is...\" Edgeworth: This grey substance must be fragments of concrete. Kay: You mean... the stuff that was scattered around the monster's footprints? Edgeworth: Exactly. Meanwhile, who do these gloves, which are stained with the same kind of dirt, belong to? Kay: Oh, I remember! We found it at Blaise's place! Edgeworth: Earlier today, we went to Blaise's garage. There, we discovered these dirt-stained gloves. Come to think of it, there were also hammers, shovels, and other tools placed inside, as well. Why would mechanic's gloves, intended to be used on machines, be covered in dirt? If he broke the concrete with the hammer, and then dug into the soil with the shovel... ...then it's only natural for dirt like that to get on the gloves. Kay: Then, maybe...! Edgeworth: Yes. The true nature of the monster's footprints... has been made clear. It's possible that these footprints were dug up by Blaise Debeste himself. Lang: Lang: It's possible...? Hmph! It's possible, you say!? Please do enlighten me. 'Cuz I honestly have no clue! Why on earth would he do something like that? Edgeworth: (Why did he make the monster footprints? Thinking about it, the answer must be...) He was digging something up Edgeworth: It's possible he was digging something up. Leads to: \"It probably went something like this.\" He buried something Edgeworth: Could it have been because he buried something? Kay: He buried something!? I smell treasure! So, what did he bury? Edgeworth: If we want to find that out, we'll have to dig it up ourselves. Lang: Lang: You think the police wouldn't have already investigated that? There was absolutely nothing buried beneath those footprints! Edgeworth: Nngwaaah! (It seems that was wrong...) In that case, we should assume the opposite: he dug something up. Leads to: \"It probably went something like this.\" Edgeworth: It probably went something like this. Last night at this spot, there was something that Blaise needed to dig up. For that reason, he broke the lock on the back door ans sneaked into the film lot... Using the hammer and shovel, he set to work. He placed the items he dug up into his bag, but before he could fill in the holes... Kay: Ah! That's when Shaun came to practice! Edgeworth: Exactly. Blaise panicked, and had no choice but to hide himself in the Moozilla costume nearby. Lang: Grr... To think you would deduce so much from just a pair of dirt-stained gloves... However! All of this is merely a possibility! There's still no proof that he was the one who was hiding inside that costume! For all we know, he might've left the scene once he finished digging! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: On the contrary. Such proof does exist, and can be seen... in the video. When this video was recorded, Blaise was definitely inside the film lot. Lang: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: (Though I can't blame Agent Lang for not noticing... ...the difference between the current flim lot... ...and the one in Shaun's video. Along with the state of Blaise's garage... ...it's all too clear that Blaise was still here!) What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded? Present duffel bag beside monster costume Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This bag placed near the costume...\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This proves that Blaise was still at the film lot! Kay: Umm... How exactly does it prove that? Lang: Yeah, I'd like a better explanation as well! Edgeworth: ...Argh! (So this has nothing to do with Blaise...) Kay: If something belonging to Blaise could be seen in this video, then proving it would be easy... Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything that comes to mind? Edgeworth: (Something belonging to Blaise... Does anything like that appear in the video?) Lang: Well, Mr. Prosecutor!? How about it...? Is there really any evidence that Blaise Debeste was there? Edgeworth: There's no need to rush, Agent Lang. Leads back to: \"What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded?\" Edgeworth: This bag placed near the costume... There was an identical one inside Blaise's garage. Lang: ! Edgeworth: First, the dirt on the gloves, and now the bag... It seems there is a connection. Mechanic's Gloves data updated in my Organizer. Edgeworth: And that's my proof. Blaise was inside the costume. Ergo, the president's body could not have been hidden inside it! Lang: Aiyaaaaaaaaa! Edgeworth: (It seems I was able to refute Agent Lang's reasoning.) Gumshoe: Someone needs to go investigate Blaise's house right away, pal! We need to know what was inside that bag! Officer: Yessir! Lotta: Y'all pipe down and listen up! Y'all just been sayin' whatever works best for y'all! Edgeworth: (...And the noisy one returns.) Lotta: That there's the footprints of the Mighty Moozilla! They ain't just some random holes dug up by that old coot! Edgeworth: Hmph. I believe the true nature of these footprints has already been proven quite logically. Lotta: Logic schmogic, I ain't buyin' it! Say whatcha want, but I know what I saw, and I saw Moozilla! Edgeworth: (Is she referring to how she saw Moozilla out of the window of the Grand Tower...? Preposterous.) Nicole: Upon our journalist's souls, we ain't havin' none of it! Edgeworth: (That statement is an insult to journalists everywhere...) Nicole: Ah! That's right! There's more to them monsters than just those footprints! I remember hearin' that sonny over there was seen with the monster earlier! I reckon that gal over there said she witnessed it herself! Edgeworth: (When these two are together, all meaningful talk grinds to a halt...) Kay: If we only knew just what the \"monster\" really was, I think those two would quiet down. Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything you can do? Edgeworth: (The monster's true identity...?) We don't have much choice... Let's see what we can do. Lotta: Isn't there somethin' y'all ain't tellin' us about the monster!? Nicole! Ask 'em! Ask 'em right now! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ....Please settle down. Regarding the true identity of that \"monster\", I already know what it is. Lotta: Wha'd ya say!? Edgeworth: That's right. The video Shaun recorded provided the hint that I needed... Lotta: Whatchu talkin' bout? Edgeworth: (Ms. Nichols saw Gourdy... ...when she went to check up on Shaun's practice. At that times, she mistook \"something\" for Gourdy.) The \"monster\" can be seen in this photograph. Lotta: What!? Ain't that just some plain old souvenir photo!? Y'all don't really think ya can pull the wool over the eyes of a pro like me, do ya? Edgeworth: (What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?) Present camera crane Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was...\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The \"Gourdy\" that Ms. Nichols saw... was actually this! Lotta: There ain't no foolin' a real pro! Yer sayin' this is Gourdy!? It don't look nothin' like it! Edgeworth: Argh! (I had my suspicions...) Kay: Let's double-check what Gourdy looks like. Something with a similar shape might be in the photo! Edgeworth: Indeed. (Gourdy's shape...?) Leads back to: \"(What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?)\" Edgeworth: Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was... ...this camera crane! Lotta: Wh-What!? Edgeworth: The video Shaun recorded was shot from fairly high up. A shot from this position would be impossible without a camera crane. Nicole: But...! There ain't no way Ms. Nichols would mistake a camera crane for Gourdy! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I wonder about that. ...Ms. Nichols. Penny: Y-Yes! Edgeworth: Earlier, you said the prescription for your glasses didn't match your eyesight anymore, correct? Penny: Yes. Lately, it seems like my eyesight has suddenly gotten a lot worse. Edgeworth: So would you say that you weren't able to see Gourdy very clearly in the dark? Penny: That's right... Its silhouette was all I could make out... Nicole: But, remember what Ms. Nichols said!? And I quote, \"Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile...\"! Lotta: Camera cranes ain't got no flesh on 'em, let alone skin! It's just a bare steel frame! Edgeworth: That is certainly true. At least, in the case of this photo... However, last night it did have skin. Lotta: Y'all just doin' whatever ya can to get in the way of our big scoop, ain't ya!? Edgeworth: (That was not my intention... ...but since I've come this far, it's time to put an end to your nonsense.) Gourdy's skin is right before our very eyes. This is the \"skin\" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw! Present vinyl sheets Edgeworth: Leads to: \"As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night.\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is the true identity of Gourdy's skin! Lotta: And just how could somethin' like that be taken for skin, ya heinous prosecutor!? Yer just spoutin' nonsense, tryin' to take our whole scoop for yerself! Yer pure evil! Yer a demon prosecutor! Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (That is decidedly not what I'm trying to do.) On its own, the crane bears no resemblance to Gourdy at all. Kay: Something must have been draped over the crane. Edgeworth: (Last night, it looked like it was going to rain... And if that's the case, there's only one thing it could have been!) Leads back to: \"This is the \"skin\" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw!\" Edgeworth: As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night. While it never actually rained... ...Shaun still covered the camera crane with a rainproof sheet. Which, to Ms. Nichols... looked like a monster's skin! Nicole: Whaaaaaaaat! Lotta: Y-Ya gotta be kiddin' meeee! Edgeworth: Isn't that right, Shaun? Shaun: Man, you saw through it all. .....Not bad, old man. Edgeworth: Unfortunately, the \"Gourdy\" that Ms. Nichols saw was nothing more than an illusion. Lotta: Not again... Looks like my dream has shriveled up and died once again... Nicole: M-Mentor! Kay: Seems like things have finally settled down. Lotta: I really thought the boy was hidin' somethin' from me... Guess I had it all wrong. Lang: ...Now that we've figured out the true form of the monster, everyone seems refreshed. Kay: Actually, there's two people here who are totally bummed out. Forensics: Agent Lang! The report is in, sir! We've got the results of President Huang's autopsy! Lang: Good! Show it to me! Lang: \"Contusions and bone fractures found across the body, resulting from tremendous pressure.\" So, this was the cause of death. In other words... he was crushed to death. Edgeworth: (I thought as much...) Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer. Lang: The yellow stain on his chest is currently under investigation... ...but it seems that gunpowder residue was found on his right hand. Kay: Sunflower residue!? I didn't know the president was into gardening! Edgeworth: No, gunpowder residue. Traces of it are left behind when a gun is fired. Since it has been found on his right hand, it's possible that the president fired a gun. Kay: A gun, huh? But we didn't find any guns when we investigated this area. Edgeworth: (...Unexplained gunpowder residue? I'll have to look over the autopsy report later.) Now then, Agent Lang. It seems we have our answer. The president did not die from falling off the roof of the Grand Tower. Rather, he died from being crushed under Moozilla's head! Lang: I can't deny it... Looks like your logic was right after all. Kay: This means the suspicions surrounding Ms. Gravelle should be cleared up, right!? Edgeworth: Yes... Not only the cause of death, but the time of death proves her innocence as well. Judge Gravelle met with the president two nights ago. However, according to the autopsy report, the time of death was around 11 PM last night. Moozilla's head also fell last night... It matches up perfectly. Kay: That's a relief! Lang: Lang: ...Isn't it a bit too early to be relieved? Edgeworth: (Agent Lang?) Lang: The president died after being crushed by the Moozilla's head. That, I will admit. But the problem is, who was responsible for the falling head...? Edgeworth: Moozilla's head fell last night. And last night, the one who was at the film lot was... Gravelle: Gravelle: What are you saying!? Surely, you're not implying... Lang: That's right. You killed him, didn't you? Shaun Fenn! Shaun: ........ Lang: That pup is hiding something. He was at the scene where the body was discovered last night. He also saw the \"footprints\". And despite that, he still claims to know absolutely nothing about the incident? Isn't that a bit too convenient? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: These footprint-shaped holes have not been proven to be related to the case! Just because he saw the holes, doesn't necessarily mean that he's involved in the incident! Lang: Lang: You sure about that? Take a look at the pup's face. Shaun: .............. Lang: He looks pretty shaken up to me. Edgeworth: (It looks like he hit the mark... but Shaun doesn't want to talk about it.) Lang: If he doesn't feel like talking, then I have an idea of my own. Let's check the tape. Edgeworth: Agent Lang. What is your intention? Lang: The police have a device that lets you analyze the video footage up close and personal. Gravelle: Agent Lang. You would suspect Shaun enough to go that far... Edgeworth: (As long as Shaun's lips are sealed... ...this may be the only way for us to get closer to the truth.) Detective Gumshoe! If I'm not mistaken you have that device with you, correct? Gumshoe: Mr. Analysis is ready to go, sir! Lang: Now we're talking! Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth. Would you please perform the video analysis for us? Edgeworth: (She wants me to do it...?) Gravelle: Who knows what kind of faults that wolf-man will find in it! Edgeworth: (This isn't exactly my strong suit, but I suppose I have no choice... Are there any new clues shown on the video?) Monster costume Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It's the Moozilla costume. If you zoom in, you can see that the back is unzipped. Kay: Yeah. Mr. Powers was supposed to get inside to play the monster in the movie. ...But, I don't really get it. The Mozilla in the movie is supposed to be big enough to demolish an entire building. Once he's inside the costume, how does he activate its megazord form? Edgeworth: ...I think you have a big misunderstanding. The costume doesn't actually become big. Kay: I see. So what's big is not the costume, but the misunderstanding. Hmm... I think I kinda get it now. Thanks! Edgeworth: (Does she really understand...?) Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Dirt ground Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Blaised Debeste used the tools in his garage to dig up something. Kay: There was a huge hammer in his garage too. Edgeworth: Indeed. That was probably used to break the concrete. As it turns out, these weren't Moozilla's footprints at all. Are you disappointed? Kay: A Great Thief needs to have the strength to accept the truth, no matter how hard it is. I must become stronger. Much, much stronger! Edgeworth: (...I guess she couldn't handle the truth.) Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Di-Jun Huang (after zooming) Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(Th-This is...!)\" Anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's nothing of interest here. Leads back to: \"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\" Edgeworth: (Th-This is...!) Kay: What's the matter? I wanna see too! ...Hm? Eeeeeeeeeek! Lang: Hey! What's wrong!? Show it to me! Gravelle: Prosecutor Edgeworth! I request you submit the evidence to the court! Edgeworth: ...Please take a look at the top right corner of the zoomed-in video. Lang: Th-This... This person is...! ...th-the presideeeeeent! Gravelle: Impossible! Shaun: Huh!? N-No way! Lang: It seems we've finally found it at last. The evidence that points to the true killer...! Edgeworth: (This video places Shaun at a major disadvantage...!) Shaun: Y-You're wrong! That's not right! I didn't know anything about this! Lang: That's not gonna cut it. It's clear that you and the victim were together at the same place where his body was later found! Shaun Fenn! There's no doubt. You killed the president! Gravelle: N-No! This can't be...! Why, why would you...? Shaun... please don't tell me... Did you really kill the president? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Is this really decisive evidence...? Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. Looks like even you can't object to this. Edgeworth: (Ngh...!) Lang: That pup said he didn't know anything, right? And yet, the president's right here in the video! Shaun: ........ Edgeworth: Shaun! What are you hiding? Gravelle: Shaun...! Please tell us the truth! Shaun: .......... The truth is... The truth is... It's all my fault... Gravelle: Shaun Fenn! What did you do!? Shaun: M-M-Moozilla's head falling was all my fault! -- During the Rehearsal -- Shaun: While I was setting up the equipment on the roof, I used the heater... After that, I went down to practice, but I forgot to turn it off. Then my mom called me, so I left the film lot. When I came back to the lot, after the phone call was over... Moozilla's head that was on the roof had fallen... And right next to it was the president, lying dead on the ground... Gravelle: H-How can that be...? Edgeworth: I see. There were indeed traces that something had caught fire on the rooftop. Shaun: ..It was just a small fire, so I was able to put it out by myself. Kay: So... the president's death was Shaun's fault? Gumshoe: But, wouldn't that make this an accident, sir? Edgeworth: ...And then, what did you do with the fallen head? Shaun: I took it apart, brought the pieces up to the roof, and put it back together. Lang: Lang: So, you put out the fire, and even put the fallen head back on the roof. Which means you were hiding evidence... We can't be having that, you naughty little pup. Shaun: I didn't do it on purpose! I really did just forget to turn off the heater... Edgeworth: When the legs broke, the stand would have tilted. If Moozilla's head was on top of the stand... Kay: ...it would've fallen off! So, the head fell down because of the fire! Edgeworth: Yes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness. Lang: Lang: ...Was it really just an accident? If that's the truth, then what was the president doing here? Shaun: I-I don't know! There was no one else around when I was there! Lang: You expect me to believe that!? The president wouldn't have just come to a place like this without a reason, you know! Edgeworth: (Indeed, the president's reason for coming here is still a huge mystery... Two nights ago, he met with Judge Gravelle on the roof of the Grand Tower... ...and last night, he was here at the film lot. Did he meet with Shaun...? I'll have to listen to Shaun's testimony very carefully...!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Shaun. You are still young. I know it can get a little cold in early spring, but you shouldn't have to resort to a heater... Gravelle: Gravelle: It is precisely because he is young that he must make sure to take good care of himself! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: However, while it can get a bit chilly during this time of year, I wouldn't necessarily say... Shaun: Hold it, old man. Is this really the right time to be having this argument? Edgeworth: G..... Gah! (He's completely right.) Gravelle: Shaun. You did well to get the better of Mr. Edgeworth, but please mind your language. Edgeworth: (Let's not forget that he got the better of you too, Your Honor...) Shaun: I-I know, Mom... So, umm... where was I? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You forgot to turn off the heater? You didn't check it before leaving the roof? Shaun: I meant to turn it off, but I was too focused on practicing, so... And come on, everyone forgets stuff like that sometimes! Kay: Yeah, I gotcha! I forget small things like that all the time too! Like sometimes, I'll forget to turn off the AC or the lights in Mr. Edgeworth's office... ...or I'll jump off the ladder for his bookshelves, or leave prank calls on his answering machine. But forgetting to turn off the heater is really dangerous, so you've gotta be careful! Edgeworth: (Some of those things had nothing to do with forgetfulness...) Shaun. Please continue. Shaun: Looks like you've got it rough too, old man. Well, back to my story... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It was late at night at the film lot... and not a single member of the film crew was around. So then, why did you have to leave the premises in order to answer the phone call? Shaun: I totally forgot about the phone call thing... so I kinda panicked. If I didn't answer it fast, I would have been busted for leaving the hotel without permission. Edgeworth: In that case, why didn't you just answer it here? Shaun: B-Because I was rehearsing, all the cameras and mics were on. If I talked here, every last word I said to Mom would've been caught on camera! Edgeworth: (So he was embarrassed that the conversation with his mother would be recorded.) Shaun: Anyways, I stopped practicing for a bit and rushed out of the film lot. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In that phone call, you lied and said you were at the hotel, correct? Kay: Why didn't you tell your mom that you were rehearsing? Shaun: If I told her that, she would've called the hotel and made them send me a taxi or something. Gravelle: Gravelle: Of course I would have! A child alone on the streets at the time of night... What sort of parent would allow their child to be in such a dangerous situation!? Edgeworth: Hmm. I guess kids just don't understand how their parents feel. Kay: It goes both ways, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Now then, Shaun. Please tell us about what happened after the phone call. Shaun: Huh? O-Oh yeah. Of course. When the call was finished and I came back here... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was there any indication that the head was about to fall? Shaun: ...I-I don't know. I was focused on my rehearsal. Edgeworth: So you forgot to turn off the heater, which led to a fire on the roof. I would think you should have at least heard something. Shaun: Heard something...? Oh, I was wearing headphones, so... Edgeworth: Headphones? Shaun: Listening to the movie's soundtrack helps me get into the scene... I had it on full blast. That's why I didn't hear anything. Edgeworth: And yet, you noticed your mother's incoming call? Shaun: I had my phone on vibrate, old man. That's how I noticed. Anyways, the head had fallen... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What was the state of the body? Shaun: ...I didn't get a good look. 'Cause it was dark. ........ Edgeworth: (Hm? He's suddenly become as quiet as a mouse.) Kay: I guess Shaun doesn't really want to remember anything about the body... Edgeworth: (...Is that the only reason why he's gone so quiet? Should I press him for more details?) Press him further Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Leave him be Edgeworth: (It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.) Edgeworth: You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead? Shaun: ! Th-That's... well... Edgeworth: (He's clearly shaken. ...He must be hiding something.) Wouldn't you normally call for help if you see someone collapsed on the ground? However, you did nothing of the sort... Shaun: But... But he...! He was already dead... Edgeworth: Is that so? You seem quite certain that the president was already dead... Now, is there a reason for that, I wonder? Shaun: The guy was collapsed on the ground, and right next to him was the fallen monster's head. I'm not stupid. It wasn't hard to imagine what happened... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You can imagine whatever you want, but there was no way for you to know that he was dead! You actually checked to make sure the president was dead, didn't you? Shaun: Urk.....! Y-Yeah... that's right! I was scared... but I got up close to the body and checked to see if he was breathing. Edgeworth: (I thought as much... However, why would he hide that? There must be a reason...) ...Please tell me the state of the body at that time. Shaun: A-At first, I didn't know he was dead... I would've realized sooner if there had been any blood... ...but there wasn't a single drop, and his clothes were completely spotless. Either way, he wasn't breathing. That's how I knew he was already dead... Edgeworth: ...Would you please append those statements to your testimony? Add statements: \"I didn't know right away that he was dead. There was no blood, and his clothes were spotless.\" and \"But he wasn't breathing at all when I checked, so I knew he was already dead.\" Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Edgeworth: (It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you knew immediately that it was the president? Shaun: Not right away. It was dark, so I had to get a bit closer. But... I knew his face because we worked together briefly, after all. Kay: Y-You worked with the president!? Wow, Shaun...! When did you do that!? Edgeworth: Have you already forgotten, Kay? The president had a cameo in this movie. Kay: Ah! That's right! Of course... N-Now I remember! Edgeworth: Good for you. So, Shaun. You confirmed he was dead? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were unable to tell if he was dead because of the lack of stains on his clothes... Are you certain of that? Shaun: Of course I am. You guys saw the body too, right? So what's the big ideal!? Edgeworth: You said that the area was dark. And yet, you were still able to make that observation? Shaun: I'm telling you, there wasn't a single stain on his entire body! Give it a rest, old man! Edgeworth: Heh... Thank you, Shaun. That was all I needed to hear. Kay: Are clean clothes that important to you, Mr. Edgeworth? Mine are freshly washed though! Edgeworth: Next... could you tell me how you determined that the president was dead? Shaun: Well, there wasn't anything to let me know right away that he was dead, you see... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did you check if he had stopped breathing? Shaun: They taught us how at school. You get right up close to the person's nose... ...and check to see if you can feel their breath. I never thought I'd have to do it for real, though... Kay: That was really brave of you, to be able to do something like that. Shaun, you sure are amazing for an elementary school kid. Edgeworth: Kay, he's in middle school. Please try to get that into your head sometime soon... Kay: It'd be pretty scary to see a corpse just suddenly appear out of the blue like that... Not to mention the fallen monster head lying next to the body. Edgeworth: Panic would certainly be an understandable response to such a situation. Kay: But still, all things considered... This was just an accident, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. That is, if we decide to take Shaun's words at face value... (I wouldn't mind having some more concrete details on the state of the crime scene...)-- Kanis's Savior -- Kanis: Certainly, it was I who killed President Huang. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You admitted that rather easily. Kanis: These days, I have long grown tired of killing. ...Keh heh heh. But in those halcyon days, I devoted myself to the path of an executioner. If one cannot admit that much, what can he admit? Right, Anubis? Yes, yes, my boy. Kay: I feel like he's saying something scary, but it's kind of hard to understand him! Edgeworth: This fallen priest is saying he has no feelings about the president's death. (Kanis, the assassin and escaped prisoner. He should be a despicable opponent, but... ...silencing him now would be imprudent. I must keep my composure and let him talk!) I understand your point. ...You killed the president. Kanis: That is correct. The aim of my blade never misses its mark. Kanis: However, my life was also targeted on that day. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your life was targeted? You, the assassin? Kay: The hunter becomes the hunted. The Buddhist becomes the Buddha. Edgeworth: Kay, you don't have to make up strange proverbs. Kanis: ...Life is transient. Especially for an assassin, whose life is always exposed to danger. Kay: So, does that mean people you've tried to kill have fought back? Kanis: That is a rare occurrence... However, this was different. Kanis: The body double, Blaise, and Fifi all sought to seal my lips. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Bodhidharma Kanis. You are a master assassin. As such, could you not have evaded an attack from those three and fled the scene...? Kanis: Keh heh heh. You greatly overestimate me. Without Anubis by my side, I would not even be able to walk about. If those three were to attack me all at once, I would not stand a chance. Edgeworth: I see. So even an assassin will fall to superior numbers in a frontal assault. Kanis: I suppose one could say that. I, Bodhidharma Kanis, would have suffered a shameful defeat. Kanis: Had I not been reunited with the young acolyte back then, I would have been in danger. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Reunited...? So, when did you first meet with him? Kanis: That would be 18 years ago, on the 24th of December. Edgeworth: (That is a rather long time ago...) Kanis: On that day, our roles were reversed. I saved the young one's life. There was an unusual snowstorm on that day. The temperature was well below freezing. I took Anubis for a walk in the snow. That's when Anubis noticed something and started running. I followed after him and found a car. I had great difficulty opening the door. It had frozen shut. In the back seat... there were two young children, shivering from the cold. Edgeworth: Two children? Kanis: Had they remained in the car for an hour longer, they surely would have frozen to death. I brought the two of them to a nearby orphanage... Edgeworth: (Is there anything about Kanis's story that concerns me?) There is something Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Leave him be Edgeworth: (I don't think there's anything in particular that stands out...) Kanis, please continue your testimony. Edgeworth: (What concerns me is...) The date Leads to: \"The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that?\" The number of children Edgeworth: There were two children in the car... you're sure of that? Kanis: It may have been 18 years ago, but I remember it clearly. There were two children in the car, there is no mistaking it. Does the good prosecutor have a problem with that number? Edgeworth: (Right now, the number of children isn't what I have a problem with.) Kanis: Are we done talking about this subject yet? Leads back to: \"(What concerns me is...)\" The model of the car Edgeworth: What was the model of the car the children were in? Kanis: The model of the car? What would you want to know that for? It was a typical mid-size car, the kind you see everywhere. Other than the freezing children sitting inside, there was nothing unusual about it. Edgeworth: (...Looks like the car model is of no real importance.) Kanis: Are we done talking about this subject yet? Leads back to: \"(What concerns me is...)\" Edgeworth: The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that? Kanis: There is no mistake. Ray: C-Could that mean...!? Edgeworth: (I know... the significance behind that date.) What shows the significance of the date when Kanis found the children? Present IS-7 Incident Documents Edgeworth: Leads to: \"That day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence is connected to that date, isn't it? Kay: Ummm... How exactly is it connected? Kanis: I don't know what the good prosecutor brought out... ...but I can sense that there is no real connection behind it. Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (Kanis saw through it.) Kay: Mr. Kanis found the children on December 24th! Let's try looking at the evidence again with that date in mind! Leads back to: \"(I know... the significance behind that date.)\" Kanis: But alas, even to this day, I do not know what has become of the young acolyte... Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And now you're searching for the boy from all those years ago? Surely, you're not saying you want to thank him for saving you? Kanis: Keh heh heh... Well, who knows. However, the young one did save my life. That is the truth. Even Anubis took a liking to him. He would do tricks for him, such as \"shake\" or \"roll over\". Kay: I thought that the tricks Kanis taught his dog were a little bit different from the norm, though. Kanis: You are right about that. For Anubis, \"roll over\" means first biting the victim's foot... Kay: Stop! Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear any more! Kanis: Keh heh heh... There is no need to worry, I only showed the young one ordinary tricks. Edgeworth: (...Hmm. I get the feeling that Kanis, in his own way, felt indebted to the boy.) Kay: Mr. Kanis and that \"acolyte\" seem to share a complicated relationship, huh. Edgeworth: Perhaps there is a hint to the mastermind's motive hidden somewhere in his testimony. Kanis is one of the few people who knows the mastermind first hand... Let's try to draw out as much information as possible from him. Edgeworth: That day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered. Kay: Ah! Edgeworth: During that incident, two young boys went missing. The sons of the victim, Isaac Dover, and the culprit, Dane Gustavia... Ray: We never did find out where those two boys went after the case 18 years ago... Kanis: Oh? They were the sons of a victim and a culprit? It all makes sense now. Edgeworth: What makes sense? Kanis: One of the youths was bound, so that he could not move. Kay: Mr. Dover did it so that Mr. Gustavia's son couldn't come to the contest venue. Edgeworth: Indeed. Gustavia was using his own son as a taste tester. Kanis: Keh heh heh heh. To think that was what transpired. Neither child seemed to recall what had happened. Edgeworth: They lost their memories? Kanis: The acolyte told me this when we were reunited 12 years ago. The pair were placed in an extreme situation, on the verge of freezing to death... That trauma led them both to suffer from amnesia. Neither could so much as remember his own name. Kay: So they didn't even know that they were the sons of Mr. Dover and Mr. Gustavia. Edgeworth: Indeed, while we cannot say it conclusively, the probability is quite high. (However, we still don't have enough information to deduce the mastermind's identity...) Kanis... Would you please continue your story? Kanis: Keh heh. Very well. -- Kanis and the \"Acolyte\" -- Kanis: I continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison. Recently, that has all come to an abrupt halt, however. It left me quite concerned. Furthermore, those involved in the crime 12 years ago were all drawn into incidents one by one. I grew more and more curious. And so I absconded briefly from the prison. Edgeworth: Those involved 12 years ago... ...were Fifi Laguarde, Blaise Debeste, and President Huang's body double. Kay: And Ms. Laguarde was the warden of Mr. Kanis's prison. Kanis: Keh heh heh. I blackmailed the warden. That woman had tried to kill me. Perhaps the good prosecutor has already deduced the reason? Edgeworth: You murdered President Huang... However, the world still believed he was alive. If you were able to prove the president was a fake... ...both Fifi Laguarde and Blaise Debeste would have been in danger. Kanis: That is correct. And I had heard the proof with my own ears. I'll be waiting in the courtyard of the orphanage at midnight on February 9th. Even if it's just once, I want Shaun to be able to meet you. I'm sorry if I'm being selfish, but... I'll be waiting. Huang: ...Who might you be? My apologies, but I am presently waiting for someone... Kanis: Keh heh heh. I am well aware of that... President Huang. Are you not meeting with your son? However, I do not spill blood needlessly. You may relax. I seek only the president's life. Huang: .........It can't be. P-Please wait. I am just about to meet my son for the first time. I'm sure this will be the first and the last time. Please, at least wait until we are finished... Kanis: I had thought the president would beg for his life, but he was of a different sort. Officially, the president had no son. However, he shook his head and said... ...this illegitimate son was his, and he intended to recognize him publicly. Furthermore, he claimed that he had already made preparations towards that end... Would that son of his be the boy with horns over there by any chance? Kay: Boy... with the horns? Wait, you can see Shaun's horns? Kanis: Keh heh heh. There is no need to see them. From the moment I escaped from prison until now... ...I have been closely lending an ear to your voices. Edgeworth: (He said that the president made \"preparations\" towards recognizing his son... ...but the word \"preparations\" alone would be insufficient for blackmail.) ........That's it! Lang: There was one thing that could prove Huang's words: the will held by the House of Lang. It was also proof of his trust in us. His son's existence would've been revealed to the world. Kanis: The name on the recording, the mention of preparations, and the will in Zheng Fa... Keh heh heh. Together, they sufficed to make the Warden bow to my words. Edgeworth: (With those three pieces of information, one could prove the identity of the double... ...by using Shaun!) Shaun: .......... Kanis: The president blocked the first strike of my knife with something soft. As pieces of it fell atop the snow, I struck once more. This time, the blow proved fatal. Edgeworth: (So Kanis cut off the Moozilla doll's horn...) Kanis: None but I heard his final words. Only myself and that child knew of the president's secret son. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In other words, you contacted him from prison? Kanis: Keh heh heh. That is correct. A post-office box was used. Kay: A post-office box...? Edgeworth: It would allow one to send and receive letters without revealing the recipient's location. Kanis: I could not use a form of correspondence that would reveal the acolyte's location. ...There was someone keeping watch over my correspondences, after all. Edgeworth: (He must mean the prison warden... Fifi Laguarde.) Could you be more specific about the nature of your correspondences? Kanis: Well. They were mainly moves from my correspondence chess matches. Kay: C-Correspondence chess? If I recall, the person you were playing against... Edgeworth: This might be hard to believe... but Kanis's chess opponent was... Kay: Ah! Are you saying he was playing against Mr. Knightley? Wasn't it Horace Knightley? Edgeworth: We certainly found the correspondence chess memo in Knightley's cell. Correspondence Chess Memo jotted down in my Organizer. Ray: Does that mean... Knightley-boy was the kid from the IS-7 Incident? Edgeworth: (Could... that really be true? Is there any evidence connecting Knightley to the IS-7 Incident?) Present Knightley's Mementos Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence. Ray: What about it? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think it has anything to do with the incident at all, though. Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (Perhaps I should think it over one more time?) Ray: Why don't you look over Knightley-boy's belongings one more time? Something related to the IS-7 Incident just might pop out! Edgeworth: (Knightley's belongings, huh? Let's look over them one more time...) Edgeworth: (This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within? Which should I investigate? The ring or the chessboard...?) The ring Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" The chessboard Edgeworth: (Obviously, we should investigate the chessboard.) Ray: Huh? Miles, what are you doing taking out the chessboard? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think the chessboard has anything to do with the IS-7 Incident. Edgeworth: Argh! (He may be right... In that case, the only piece of evidence left to investigate is...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: This ring is...! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, what is it? Edgeworth: Mr. Shields, please take a look at this ring! Ray: Th-This pattern is... It's Pierre Hoquet's! Edgeworth: I thought so... He had Mr. Dover's seal turned into a ring. However, why would he have this? Shouldn't it have been held by the police as evidence from the IS-7 Incident? Ray: After the incident, the seal was returned to the victim's next-of-kin. And Mr. Dover's only family was his son. But since no one knew where the son had gone to, it took a while to get it to him. I'd heard that the police had finally found him and delivered his inheritance, but... Edgeworth: ...So the seal was thereby safely delivered to his son. And then, he turned the seal into a ring and wore it on his person. Knightley's Mementos data updated in my Organizer. Kay: So... Mr. Knightley was Mr. Dover's son... Ray: The police aren't fools. I'm sure they did a thorough check before handing over the seal. Kay: If someone involved in the IS-7 Incident was his chess opponent... Lang: Knightley, huh. Then that man must be the mastermind behind this case! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But, Knightley is dead! He cannot be involved in this incident. Ray: How about that. The only one who could be the mastermind was himself a murder victim...? Kay: But a dead guy can't be the culprit! So there's no way that's right! Edgeworth: (It certainly is strange... In that case, who is the culprit?) Add statement: \"Writing letters in braille can be a rather enjoyable pastime.\" Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence. Ray: What about it? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think it has anything to do with the incident at all, though. Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (Perhaps I should think it over one more time?) Ray: Why don't you look over Knightley-boy's belongings one more time? Something related to the IS-7 Incident just might pop out! Edgeworth: (Knightley's belongings, huh? Let's look over them one more time...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: (Obviously, we should investigate the chessboard.) Ray: Huh? Miles, what are you doing taking out the chessboard? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think the chessboard has anything to do with the IS-7 Incident. Edgeworth: Argh! (He may be right... In that case, the only piece of evidence left to investigate is...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That was your means of playing correspondence chess. You used chess notation for your moves. Kanis: Keh heh heh... as expected, the good prosecutor has done a thorough investigation. Kay: His chess opponent was Horace Knightley, right? Edgeworth: The ring Knightley wore... Mr. Shields, please have a close look at it. Ray: Yeah, there's no mistake. This is the evidence from the IS-7 Incident. The police found Mr. Dover's son and returned it to him. If you're saying that the son was Knightley, then... ...the acolyte, who was Kanis's chess opponent and the mastermind, was Knightley? Edgeworth: No, Knightley has already been murdered. He cannot be at the center of the incident. There is no doubt that the mastermind is still hiding somewhere out there. Kay: ...Well then, Mr. Kanis. Sorry to have kept you waiting. Kanis: Hmm... that was a rather interesting tale. Wasn't it, Anubis? I shall continue my story about the acolyte. Our longstanding chess match continued... Edgeworth: (It seems she's not much good with the assassin's dog.) Kanis: Good boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It came to a halt? Now, of all times? Kanis: Quite odd, is it not? Anubis told me again and again how odd it was. Kay: That scary dog talked? Was he like, \"Something's odd, woof!\"? Kanis: Keh heh heh. I can understand Anubis's heart, even if he does not voice his thoughts. Kay: Umm... Then, there's something I'd like to ask, just in case. Your scary dog's staring at me right now... He's not saying, \"I'm hungry. I want some meat\", right? Kanis: Keh heh heh... Perhaps. Kay: P... Perhaps... Aaaaah... M-Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (It seems she's not much good with the assassin's dog.) Kanis: Good boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That certainly does seem too much for a mere coincidence. The body double of Di-Jun Huang, the president of Zheng Fa faked an assassination plot. Fifi Laguarde, the prison warden, murdered Horace Knightley. And Blaise Debeste, the Chairman of the P.I.C, murdered Jill Crane. (Come to think of it, as I have been investigating these cases... ...I have felt the presence of some force behind the scenes.) Kanis: Keh heh heh. Even within the prison, I could tell that this was no insignificant event. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You absconded briefly from prison? I cannot forgive such a criminal act! Kay: You stole your way out of prison? I cannot forgive such a thieving act! Kanis: Keh heh heh... Relax. No one was hurt. I merely have connections that allow me to set foot outside. Gumshoe: B-But even so, you can't just escape from prison, pal! Arrest him! Arrest him! Kanis: That won't be necessary. Once my business is done, I shall return to my cell. Lang: ...You trying to make fools of us? A prison isn't the kind of place you can just enter and leave at will! Kanis: Keh heh heh. The Wolf may say that... ...but one can see that the Wolf and his pack also share an interest in the tales of my past. Lang: Tch...! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, Detective Gumshoe. There are still a few things I must ask Kanis. Please postpone matters until then. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I knew you'd say that, Mr. Edgeworth! Lang: Dammit all... But I'm not taking my eye off you for a second! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Excuse me, but you wrote your letters in braille? Kanis: Indeed. For I possess the tools necessary to write in braille. Kay: Wow. So you need to use tools to write in braille. I never knew. Edgeworth: Then, would you please tell us what you wrote? Kanis: Everything. Letters, of course, and also the movements of the chess pieces. Edgeworth: (He wrote the movements of the chess pieces by hand? That statement is... intriguing.) Kay: So then, how does your handmade dog piece move? Edgeworth: Kay, that question can wait. So then... what did you do when the letters stopped coming? Kanis: Keh heh heh... Within the prison, I grew increasingly concerned about the acolyte's whereabouts. Kay: OK, OK... Umm... But even so, I don't really get it. Who exactly is this \"acolyte\"? Edgeworth: Indeed. Kanis himself has not yet made that clear. (What's important is the thread connecting Kanis and this \"acolyte\": their correspondence. And not just the letters. We should pay attention to the means that was used as well.)-- Kanis and the \"Acolyte\" -- Kanis: I continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: In other words, you contacted him from prison? Kanis: Keh heh heh. That is correct. A post-office box was used. Kay: A post-office box...? Edgeworth: It would allow one to send and receive letters without revealing the recipient's location. Kanis: I could not use a form of correspondence that would reveal the acolyte's location. ...There was someone keeping watch over my correspondences, after all. Edgeworth: (He must mean the prison warden... Fifi Laguarde.) Could you be more specific about the nature of your correspondences? Kanis: Well. They were mainly moves from my correspondence chess matches. Kay: C-Correspondence chess? If I recall, the person you were playing against... Edgeworth: This might be hard to believe... but Kanis's chess opponent was... Kay: Ah! Are you saying he was playing against Mr. Knightley? Wasn't it Horace Knightley? Edgeworth: We certainly found the correspondence chess memo in Knightley's cell. Correspondence Chess Memo jotted down in my Organizer. Ray: Does that mean... Knightley-boy was the kid from the IS-7 Incident? Edgeworth: (Could... that really be true? Is there any evidence connecting Knightley to the IS-7 Incident?) Present Knightley's Mementos Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence. Ray: What about it? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think it has anything to do with the incident at all, though. Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (Perhaps I should think it over one more time?) Ray: Why don't you look over Knightley-boy's belongings one more time? Something related to the IS-7 Incident just might pop out! Edgeworth: (Knightley's belongings, huh? Let's look over them one more time...) Edgeworth: (This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within? Which should I investigate? The ring or the chessboard...?) The ring Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" The chessboard Edgeworth: (Obviously, we should investigate the chessboard.) Ray: Huh? Miles, what are you doing taking out the chessboard? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think the chessboard has anything to do with the IS-7 Incident. Edgeworth: Argh! (He may be right... In that case, the only piece of evidence left to investigate is...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: This ring is...! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, what is it? Edgeworth: Mr. Shields, please take a look at this ring! Ray: Th-This pattern is... It's Pierre Hoquet's! Edgeworth: I thought so... He had Mr. Dover's seal turned into a ring. However, why would he have this? Shouldn't it have been held by the police as evidence from the IS-7 Incident? Ray: After the incident, the seal was returned to the victim's next-of-kin. And Mr. Dover's only family was his son. But since no one knew where the son had gone to, it took a while to get it to him. I'd heard that the police had finally found him and delivered his inheritance, but... Edgeworth: ...So the seal was thereby safely delivered to his son. And then, he turned the seal into a ring and wore it on his person. Knightley's Mementos data updated in my Organizer. Kay: So... Mr. Knightley was Mr. Dover's son... Ray: The police aren't fools. I'm sure they did a thorough check before handing over the seal. Kay: If someone involved in the IS-7 Incident was his chess opponent... Lang: Knightley, huh. Then that man must be the mastermind behind this case! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But, Knightley is dead! He cannot be involved in this incident. Ray: How about that. The only one who could be the mastermind was himself a murder victim...? Kay: But a dead guy can't be the culprit! So there's no way that's right! Edgeworth: (It certainly is strange... In that case, who is the culprit?) Add statement: \"Writing letters in braille can be a rather enjoyable pastime.\" Press (after fully pressing this statement) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That was your means of playing correspondence chess. You used chess notation for your moves. Kanis: Keh heh heh... as expected, the good prosecutor has done a thorough investigation. Kay: His chess opponent was Horace Knightley, right? Edgeworth: The ring Knightley wore... Mr. Shields, please have a close look at it. Ray: Yeah, there's no mistake. This is the evidence from the IS-7 Incident.

At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt. Kanis: Recently, that has all come to an abrupt halt, however. It left me quite concerned. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It came to a halt? Now, of all times? Kanis: Quite odd, is it not? Anubis told me again and again how odd it was. Kay: That scary dog talked? Was he like, \"Something's odd, woof!\"? Kanis: Keh heh heh. I can understand Anubis's heart, even if he does not voice his thoughts. Kay: Umm...

At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt. Kanis: Furthermore, those involved in the crime 12 years ago were all drawn into incidents one by one. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That certainly does seem too much for a mere coincidence. The body double of Di-Jun Huang, the president of Zheng Fa faked an assassination plot. Fifi Laguarde, the prison warden, murdered Horace Knightley. And Blaise Debeste, the Chairman of the P.I.C, murdered Jill Crane. (Come to think of it, as I have been investigating these cases... ...I have felt the presence of some force behind the scenes.) Kanis: Keh heh heh. Even within the prison, I could tell that this was no insignificant event. Kanis: I grew more and more curious. And so I absconded briefly from the prison. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You absconded briefly from prison? I cannot forgive such a criminal act! Kay: You stole your way out of prison? I cannot forgive such a thieving act! Kanis: Keh heh heh... Relax. No one was hurt. I merely have connections that allow me to set foot outside. Gumshoe: B-But even so, you can't just escape from prison, pal! Arrest him! Arrest him!

(What's important is the thread connecting Kanis and this \"acolyte\": their correspondence. And not just the letters. We should pay attention to the means that was used as well.) Edgeworth: I'm certain you said... You wrote your letters in braille. Kanis: Correct. The good prosecutor must know that I am lacking in sight, do you not? Edgeworth: The correspondence chess letter we found had been typed out using a word processor. Kanis: What? That... cannot be. Edgeworth: What do you mean...? Kay: So, someone went of their way to retype the letters on a computer? Edgeworth: Could another person have acted as a middleman between Kanis and Knightley? Kay: What do you mean? Edgeworth: Kanis wrote his letters in braille. However... ...by the time it reached Knightley, it had been rewritten on a word processor. ...We must assume that some middleman rewrote those letters. Ray: And the reverse can also be said. That same somebody might've taken the letters Knightley wrote and redelivered them to Kanis. Edgeworth: Yes, that is indeed true. Correspondence Chess Memo updated in my Organizer. Edgeworth: Knightley and Kanis both communicated through a certain individual... Kanis, were the letters that reached you... Kanis: They were in braille, of course. Ray: So Knightley-boy's letters must have been transposed by that same person as well. Kanis: Oh...? Then that somebody must be... Edgeworth: ...the mastermind behind the case. Lang: Lang: You're saying there's someone else who's the mastermind behind this case!? Then who the hell is it!? Edgeworth: Dover's son, Knightley, is already deceased. In that case, there is one more youth that we should consider to be the mastermind. Lang: You mean, Dane Gustavia's son...? But, who the heck is he? Edgeworth: (If Knightley is Dover's son, then Gustavia's son must be...) ???: Well, we're the only friends either of us has had since childhood... He was... the same as me. We never had real families. Edgeworth: (It can't be... could it? Could it really be him?) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, what is it? You've gone all pale! Edgeworth: I've figured it out... ...The identity of the mastermind who's been controlling this case from the shadows! Kay: Whaaaat!? Who in the world is it!? Edgeworth: I don't want to believe it myself... but it is someone we know quite well. The mastermind is...! Present Simeon Saint profile Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\" Present anyone else Edgeworth: Kay: Whaaat!? That person is the mastermind!? But, according to what we've been saying, something seems kinda wrong... Edgeworth: ...Naturally. This person has no relation to the mastermind, after all. Kay: Are they related or not!? Please take this more seriously! Edgeworth: Argh! (I have to think carefully... Knightley is Dover's son. In that case, Gustavia's son is...) Regina: Mr. Knightley was his only childhood friend. Edgeworth: (It must be this person!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Who is the mastermind behind this case? Leads back to: \"The mastermind is...!\" Edgeworth: (The mastermind behind this case... ...sent a letter to Jill Crane, which deceived Blaise. Furthermore, he kidnapped Shaun and eavesdropped on us. However, of all his actions, the one I have not been able to get out of my mind... ...is how he brought an unconscious Kay to the roof.) ...............The Giant Monster. Kay: Huh? ...Did you just say something? Edgeworth: (That's right. The key to exposing the mastermind... is in the monster's true form.) Simeon: Ah... I-I almost forgot! Um, if you'd like... Please come to our next show! I-I'll also... be performing in it. Regina: The Berry Big Circus is always fabulous and fun for all ages! Edgeworth: Ms. Swift, there is something I would like to ask of you. Nicole: Wh-What! Ya mean me? Edgeworth: You said that you recorded the sound of Moozilla spewing flames. Edgeworth: ...Would this decisive evidence of yours be something you recorded on that tape recorder? Nicole: That's Mr. Edgeworth for ya! Yer good at figurin' things out, aren't ya!? It's the sound of Moozilla spewin' out fire. This place nearly became a sea of flames! Nicole: That's right. I ain't actually seen it with my own eyes, though... Edgeworth: Could you let us listen to the tape? Nicole: Sure thing. ...There we go! Edgeworth: (This sound, it's as I thought...! So, it seems that my reasoning was correct. The true nature of the monster and the mastermind... all of my logic is coming together!) Ms. Hart! You said that you captured a giant eye on film, did you not? Lotta: Sure did, right here in this photo. Edgeworth: (Though we cannot confirm it like this...) Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Lend us your film analysis device! Gumshoe: OK, but... What do you want to analyze, sir? Edgeworth: This photo, please! Gumshoe: I'm on it! Edgeworth: (Is there a new clue in this photo?) Present giant eyeball (after zooming) Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Th-This is...!\" Present Jill Crane Edgeworth: Kay: I can't really tell since the person is wearing a raincoat... ...but, this should be Ms. Crane before she died, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. She was Mr. Cameron's love interest. He was murdered 12 years ago. Kay: And she was murdered while investigating the mysteries of that past case... I'm sure she must've been very sad and frustrated by all that happened... We're... gonna finish what Ms. Crane set out to do! Right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Indeed. That was my intention all along. Just leave it to me. Leads back to: \"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)\" Present ladder Edgeworth: Kay: Ah! It's a ladder! We climbed up this ladder earlier, right!? Edgeworth: Yes, we did. (...Countless times since yesterday.) Kay: Take a look at this ladder... It's not bad, per se, but you can see how the gap between the steps is a little too wide. And these handrails would be way easier to grasp if they were just a bit more rounded. And also, the steps don't fell quite right when you're climbing on them for some reason. Hmm. I don't want to be too critical, so I'll give it around... 198 points! Edgeworth: (...Out of what?) Leads back to: \"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's nothing unusual about this area. Leads back to: \"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)\" Gumshoe: Th-This is...! Lotta: See!? Ain't the Moozilla's eye right where I said it would be!? Edgeworth: Heh... I see. I have finally grasped... ...the true form of the giant monster that was being controlled by the mastermind! Lotta: .......G Nicole: .....G-G Gumshoe: ...G-G-G Kay: Giant Monster!? Lotta: A-Are ya admittin' it? You are, ain't ya!? Yer admittin' that the Mighty Moozilla is real! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: No... This is not Moozilla. This is the eye of a different monster. Please have a look at this. Kay: It's a flyer for the Berry Big Circus...? Aah! Th-This is...! Edgeworth: Precisely. There is a rather large balloon with the head of a lion pictured here. This balloon is the true identity of the Giant Monster! In addition, the sound Ms. Swift recorded, which she believes to be Moozilla spewing flames... Nicole: Mr. Prosecutor... don't tell me, yer gonna say somethin' that'll shatter my dreams of a scoop... Gumshoe: Hot air balloons fly by using burners to hear the air, right, sir? Edgeworth: Precisely, Detective. The mastermind used this monster of his... ...to bring Kay to the rooftop of the Grand Tower without using the elevator! Kay: Wouldn't that mean... that the mastermind is someone connected to the circus? Ray: He's a member of the circus, Knightley's friend, and... Dane Gustavia's son. Wh... Who'd have thunk it...!? Edgeworth: An apprentice beast tamer? Heh..... He's no amateur. For the beast he has tamed is none other than this entire case! Simeon Saint! He is the mastermind behind this whole incident! Kay: M-Mr. Saint... was really behind it all...? N-No way...! I don't believe it! I mean, we trusted him! How could it all have been a lie!? That's just... heartbreaking... Edgeworth: Kay..... Edgeworth: Hm...? What is it? Shaun: Hey, you! Stop! Where do you think you're going!? Kanis: Keh heh heh heh... The boy with horns is rather perceptive. ...The good prosecutor has done a remarkable job. Now that I have heard that, I have no further business here. Edgeworth: What... Wait! Kanis! Grrr... *ruff, ruff!* Lang: Dammit! Where'd he vanish to!? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Are you OK!? Edgeworth: Yes, I'm fine. However... Shaun: .....That guy...! Edgeworth: ...Shaun? Shaun: That Kanis guy... he's the one who killed my dad, right? Edgeworth: (There is no question more difficult to answer. However...) There's no use in denying the truth. Yes, Shaun... You are correct. Shaun: He'll pay for this... I swear he's gonna pay...! I... I'll make him pay myse... Gravelle: Gravelle: Shaun! You mustn't finish that thought! ...Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please pay us no mind. Edgeworth: ...... Gumshoe: Sir! I've put out an APB on Kanis! All available police units will be searching for him! Lang: ...You heard the man, kid. I don't mean to be heartless, but we need to hurry, too. So Mr. Prosecutor, where's the mastermind right now? Edgeworth: ...Agent Lang is right. Our top priority right now should be catching the mastermind. He said he would be practicing. He is most likely at the Berry Big Circus tent. But first... Agent Lang, I have a request. Lang: A request...? What is it? Edgeworth: Now that we've identified the Giant Monster, our next order of business... is to capture it. The moment we arrive at the tent, I need you to locate that specific item posthaste. And Detective, I ask that you perform a follow-up investigation on the kidnapping incident. Gumshoe: Roger that, sir! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth. I wanna help out too! Edgeworth: Hmm. In that case, you'll be in charge of calling for backup. If he is truly the mastermind, we may require assistance from a certain someone... (I met him so many times, yet his facade always fooled me into sympathy. He may have got the better of me in the past... but this time, I'll settle it once and for all!) To be continued. April 6, 5:30 PMBerry Big CircusStorage Tent Regina: Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Simeon: Are you guys here for the show? Edgeworth: Mr. Saint... Ms. Berry... Simeon: You're a little early... I'm sorry, but we're still getting ready... But, I'm so happy you came! You remembered our promise! Edgeworth: Yes, I remembered... You asked us to come and see the show when you gave me this. Simeon: ...I'm so happy you came! Please enjoy yourselves! I'm sure my performance will surprise you, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Your \"performance\" has already surprised me, Mr. Saint. Simeon: .......... Regina: Umm. But he hasn't performed yet... Edgeworth: Regina. Please have a look at this photo. Is this balloon the property of the Berry Big Circus? Regina: Ah! I-It is! Did you see it flying around somewhere? Edgeworth: It's highly likely that this balloon was used by the culprit in the case we are investigating. Regina: Huh!? Edgeworth: Who is in charge of the balloon? Regina: Well, th-that would be S-Simeon, but... A-Are you saying...!? Simeon: ......... Edgeworth: Mr. Saint. You flew this balloon in the middle of the night. Did you not? Simeon: ...I do occasionally practice alone at night. I'm not much of a pilot though. I'm... a little clumsy. Edgeworth: Heh. So for practice, you'll do something as challenging as flying a balloon at night? Wouldn't that be rather difficult for someone who is clumsy and \"not much of a pilot\"? Simeon: Then... what do you think I was doing, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: You brought Kay to the roof of the Grand Tower... ...in order to frame her for the murder of Jill Crane! Not a single security camera recorded Kay using the elevator. Therefore, the only way she could have gotten up there was through flight. And the only one who could have flown her up there... was you, Mr. Saint. Simeon: No way... Mr. Edgeworth, how can you say that? Edgeworth: That's not all. You drugged Shaun at the garbage pickup, and kidnapped him. Wasn't that why you were late when you came to watch the trial of Fifi Laguarde? Simeon: No way... I have no idea what you're saying. There's no way I could do things like that. Please believe me... Mr. Edgeworth, please! Edgeworth: I wanted to believe you. However... you have broken that trust yourself! Simeon: Th... That's horrible. Why would you say that? Didn't you once say that you would trust me? That you'd believe in me? Kay: Don't you worry about that. We're your allies! That's because... we're like birds of a feather! Right, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: (Birds of a feather, huh? ...I suppose that's true.) We have sufficient information about your past. I doubt you had a motive to kill Knightley. Rather, you are probably the most affected by his death. And I doubt someone as timid as you could work up the courage to murder someone. Alright. I'll get you out of here. ...We'll believe in you. Simeon: I'm so sad... Those words were all lies... Kay: I-It wasn't a lie! We really did trust you...! Simeon: Kay, even you? You said we were like birds of a feather, and yet... I'm hurt, Kay. You've hurt me deeply... Kay: I-I-I... oooooh... Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Maybe Simeon isn't a bad guy after all... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I see. So that's how you operate. I understand now, all too well. No matter who you face, you find an emotional weakness and exploit it. You guide each person towards the outcome you desire, without them even noticing it. That... is how you were able to mastermind the entire case! Simeon: ........ Edgeworth: I may have fallen for your tricks before... but, not this time. Simeon Saint. I indict you! Simeon: ...........Hmm. So, it's come to this after all. You were always so full of confidence, Mr. Edgeworth. But, I rather like that. Because now... I can rip that confidence to shreds. Hah... Good work, everyone. Edgeworth: (Ngh..... His personality has completely changed!) So, the animal tamer who could not tame animals... That was all a facade. This is the real Simeon Saint. Regina: S-Simeon! That's not... true, is it!? Simeon: Truth or lie... What difference does it make? Regina: Huh!? Simeon: Mr. Edgeworth's just made me a little upset, that's all. Keh heh heh heh. ...You'll take responsibility for upsetting me, right? -- Balloon Practice -- Simeon: It's true. I practiced with the balloon two nights ago. That photo must have been taken when the balloon and I passed near the building. I often fly around that area for advertising purposes. There's nothing unusual about that, right? Edgeworth: You often fly around the Grand Tower in the balloon? Simeon: Yeah. Even the circus needs to advertise. Edgeworth: Regina, is that true? Regina: Y-Yup. It was Simeon's job to advertise using the balloon. Most people who live around here should have seen it. Edgeworth: That balloon was used in the crime we were investigating. Simeon: Like I said, it's just a coincidence. I simply happened to pass by the Grand Tower when that photo was taken. Edgeworth: I shall determine whether or not it was a coincidence after I hear your full story. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the balloon launched from this tent? Simeon: There's a nice, big park near the Sunshine Coliseum. I always launch the balloon there. Edgeworth: I see. In that case, how do you transport the balloon to the park? Simeon: Well, it's too heavy to carry by hand. It weighs several hundred pounds. And yet, it can fly in the sky... Amazing, isn't it? Edgeworth: I asked you how you transported it. Now answer the question. Simeon: Aww, I can't even make some small talk...? You're mean, Mr. Edgeworth. I used a truck. The balloon is loaded onto the back of the truck. Edgeworth: A truck...? Simeon: Yeah. The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago. Edgeworth: (Hmm. I cannot overlook that piece of testimony...!) Add statement: \"The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago.\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Allow me to confirm... You haven't driven the truck since then? Simeon: Do you really need to confirm that? I mean, I just said it five seconds ago. Edgeworth: Answer the question. Or would it be inconvenient for you to do so? Simeon: Ha ha. That's a pretty weak provocation, coming from you, Mr. Edgeworth! What could be inconvenient about something I've already said? Fine, I get it... That truck has been parked behind the dressing rooms since two days ago. And the balloon and basket are still inside. Is there a problem? Edgeworth: There's no problem. I simply wanted to express my thanks for that piece of testimony. (So the truck was parked here for the past two days... Heh! That was exactly what I wanted to hear, Mr. Saint!) Simeon: ...May I continue? So then, regarding the balloon... }} Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You're saying it was simply a coincidence that you were photographed near the tower? Simeon: Ah, I get it. I know how you operate now, Mr. Edgeworth. You'll insist that a coincidence is impossible until you get your way. When you say it like that, everything will inevitably go your way! How scary! Kay: Ugh! You're wrong! Mr. Edgeworth isn't like that... Edgeworth: Kay, calm down. He's only trying to provoke an emotional response. He intends to goad us into losing our focus, in order to derail the topic at hand. ...Now, why do you think he would do that? Kay: Umm, because he's a clown...? No, I mean, because he's trying to hide something, I guess? Edgeworth: Exactly, Kay. We must not let up on him. However, we must continue to keep our composure... Understand? Kay: Yep! So, Simeon. Allow me, as the assistant, to ask you a question! When you passed by the Grand Tower at that precise moment, was it really just a coincidence? Simeon: ...We could've just left things at that. But... ...for the sake of your assistant, I shall explain my reason for being there. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, in addition to advertising with the balloon, maintaining the balloon is also your job. Am I wrong? Simeon: You're a real stickler for the details, y'know. Yeah, that's right. Ask the boss if you want. ...Right, Boss? Regina: Yup. Simeon is in charge of cleaning and fixing and all that stuff with the balloon. I don't think anyone besides Simeon has used the balloon for a while now. Edgeworth: (...Hmm. That confirms he was the one riding the balloon in the photo taken two days ago. However, if he is the mastermind, he must have used it today as well. Am I able to prove that?) Simeon: Looks like you're deep in thought... Is it really that hard to comprehend? Hot air balloons fly in the sky. And in other news, the sky is blue and the grass is green. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I wonder about that. You flew the balloon in the middle of the night, eerily close to a certain other incident... Would you say there's nothing strange about that, as well? Simeon: Mr. Edgeworth, isn't that like a really leading question? Won't you please stop being such a naughty prosecutor? It's kind of downer. It's a clown's job to put smiles on people's faces, after all. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He ducks and weaves around my questions skillfully. Very well. In that case, I will simply have to make use of a more direct attack!) Edgeworth: (We still don't know much about the balloon. In any case, I must draw out more information...)-- Balloon Practice -- Simeon: It's true. I practiced with the balloon two nights ago. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the balloon launched from this tent? Simeon: There's a nice, big park near the Sunshine Coliseum. I always launch the balloon there. Edgeworth: I see. In that case, how do you transport the balloon to the park? Simeon: Well, it's too heavy to carry by hand. It weighs several hundred pounds. And yet, it can fly in the sky... Amazing, isn't it? Edgeworth: I asked you how you transported it. Now answer the question. Simeon: Aww, I can't even make some small talk...? You're mean, Mr. Edgeworth. I used a truck. The balloon is loaded onto the back of the truck. Edgeworth: A truck...? Simeon: Yeah. The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago. Edgeworth: (Hmm. I cannot overlook that piece of testimony...!) Add statement: \"The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago.\" Simeon: The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Allow me to confirm... You haven't driven the truck since then? Simeon: Do you really need to confirm that? I mean, I just said it five seconds ago. Edgeworth: Answer the question. Or would it be inconvenient for you to do so? Simeon: Ha ha. That's a pretty weak provocation, coming from you, Mr. Edgeworth! What could be inconvenient about something I've already said? Fine, I get it... That truck has been parked behind the dressing rooms since two days ago. And the balloon and basket are still inside. Is there a problem? Edgeworth: There's no problem. I simply wanted to express my thanks for that piece of testimony. (So the truck was parked here for the past two days... Heh! That was exactly what I wanted to hear, Mr. Saint!) Simeon: ...May I continue? So then, regarding the balloon... }} Present Blue Truck Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The truck you put the balloon into. Was it blue, by any chance?\" Simeon: That photo must have been taken when the balloon and I passed near the building. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You're saying it was simply a coincidence that you were photographed near the tower? Simeon: Ah, I get it. I know how you operate now, Mr. Edgeworth. You'll insist that a coincidence is impossible until you get your way. When you say it like that, everything will inevitably go your way! How scary! Kay: Ugh! You're wrong! Mr. Edgeworth isn't like that... Edgeworth: Kay, calm down. He's only trying to provoke an emotional response. He intends to goad us into losing our focus, in order to derail the topic at hand. ...Now, why do you think he would do that? Kay: Umm, because he's a clown...? No, I mean, because he's trying to hide something, I guess? Edgeworth: Exactly, Kay. We must not let up on him. However, we must continue to keep our composure... Understand? Kay: Yep! So, Simeon. Allow me, as the assistant, to ask you a question! When you passed by the Grand Tower at that precise moment, was it really just a coincidence? Simeon: ...We could've just left things at that. But... ...for the sake of your assistant, I shall explain my reason for being there. Simeon: I often fly around that area for advertising purposes. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, in addition to advertising with the balloon, maintaining the balloon is also your job. Am I wrong? Simeon: You're a real stickler for the details, y'know. Yeah, that's right. Ask the boss if you want. ...Right, Boss? Regina: Yup. Simeon is in charge of cleaning and fixing and all that stuff with the balloon. I don't think anyone besides Simeon has used the balloon for a while now. Edgeworth: (...Hmm. That confirms he was the one riding the balloon in the photo taken two days ago. However, if he is the mastermind, he must have used it today as well. Am I able to prove that?) Simeon: Looks like you're deep in thought... Is it really that hard to comprehend? Hot air balloons fly in the sky. And in other news, the sky is blue and the grass is green. Simeon: There's nothing unusual about that, right? Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I wonder about that. You flew the balloon in the middle of the night, eerily close to a certain other incident... Would you say there's nothing strange about that, as well? Simeon: Mr. Edgeworth, isn't that like a really leading question? Won't you please stop being such a naughty prosecutor? It's kind of downer. It's a clown's job to put smiles on people's faces, after all. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He ducks and weaves around my questions skillfully. Very well. In that case, I will simply have to make use of a more direct attack!) Edgeworth: (We still don't know much about the balloon. In any case, I must draw out more information...) Edgeworth: The truck you put the balloon into. Was it blue, by any chance? Simeon: Blue? So what if it is? Edgeworth: Today, we saw a blue truck carrying a large basket. If that truck just so happened to be yours... ...then your claims that you last used it two days ago becomes a lie. Simeon: ........ Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Ema! Ema: Mr. Edgeworth! I've finally found you! I've been searching for you ever since the incident yesterday! I dashed right over after Kay contacted me just a little while ago! Lang: Prosecutor Edgeworth. The thing you were looking for. I've found it. It was placed in a blue truck at the dressing room parking lot. Lion Balloon data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: A blue truck... as I suspected. That truck is, without a doubt, the one I saw today. Simeon: Simeon: There are a number of blue trucks out there, you know? Who's to say you're not mistaking it for a different one? Kay: It's definitely that one! I got a good look at it! Edgeworth?: Kay: Huh? Mr. Edgeworth, was that...? Edgeworth: I-It wasn't me...! Simeon: \"Kay. Words have no strength without evidence to back them up.\" Kay: Ah! That's Mr. Edgeworth's voice! Simeon: \"Evidence! Present evidence!\" Edgeworth: (Do I have any evidence... ...to prove that this was the truck I saw today?) Kay: Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck? Edgeworth: The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time. Kay: You can figure all that out just by touching it!? Edgeworth: What could prove that this is the truck I saw...? Looking for bloodstains Edgeworth: I'd like to check to see if there are any bloodstains left on the truck. Simeon: Bloodstains? What's the point of looking for bloodstains? Even if there's a luminol reaction, it's not like it will prove anything, right? Kay: I don't really see a point in looking for bloodstains either, Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (I'd better come up with something else.) Simeon: It's not like our brilliant prosecutor to spout out such nonsense. As I thought, there isn't any evidence at all, is there? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Is there really no evidence? Edgeworth: (If this truck is the same as the one I saw today...) Kay: Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck? Edgeworth: The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time. Kay: You can figure all that out just by touching it!? Edgeworth: (Then there must have been something left in the truck!) Leads back to: \"What could prove that this is the truck I saw...?\" Dusting for fingerprints Leads to: \"I'd like to dust the truck for fingerprints.\" Using a metal detector Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe! Please let me use your metal detector. Kay: .......... Gummy isn't here! Didn't you ask him to investigate something else for you!? Edgeworth: Ack! (I'd completely forgotten...) Simeon: Using a metal detector on a truck, you sure say some funny things. The whole truck is made of metal. Of course you would get a reaction! Edgeworth: Mmph! (I'll have to think of some other way...) Simeon: It's not like our brilliant prosecutor to spout out such nonsense. As I thought, there isn't any evidence at all, is there? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Is there really no evidence? Edgeworth: (If this truck is the same as the one I saw today...) Kay: Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck? Edgeworth: The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time. Kay: You can figure all that out just by touching it!? Edgeworth: (Then there must have been something left in the truck!) Leads back to: \"What could prove that this is the truck I saw...?\" Edgeworth: I'd like to dust the truck for fingerprints. Simeon: Eh!? Fingerprints? What for? I don't see any point in that! Edgeworth: A certain person's fingerprints should be left on this truck. And these fingerprints will prove this truck was parked in front of the Grand Tower today! (Whose fingerprints prove this truck was in front of the tower?) Miles' fingerprints Leads to: \"Edgeworth...? Your fingerprints?\" Simeon's fingerprints Simeon: My fingerprints? Wouldn't they be all over the truck anyways? After all, I'm the one who drives the truck! Finding my fingerprints on it doesn't prove a thing! Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (I guess he has a point...) Kay: We're looking for whoever left fingerprints on the truck in front of the tower, right? In that case, there's only one person it could be! Edgeworth: Indeed. It's obvious who must have touched it. Leads back to: \"(Whose fingerprints prove this truck was in front of the tower?)\" Lotta's fingerprints Lotta: Eh!? Yer sayin' they're MY fingerprints...!? Edgeworth: Indeed. We should be able to find your fingerprints on the truck. You touched the truck when it was in front of the tower, did you not? Lotta: I hate to break it to ya, but... ...I... don't reckon I ever touched that truck at all. Edgeworth: Argh! (It seems I was mistaken...) Kay: We're looking for whoever left fingerprints on the truck in front of the tower, right? In that case, there's only one person it could be! Edgeworth: Indeed. It's obvious who must have touched it. Leads back to: \"(Whose fingerprints prove this truck was in front of the tower?)\" Simeon: Edgeworth...? Your fingerprints? Edgeworth: Indeed. Earlier today, I touched a truck at the plaza in front of the Grand Tower. I'd like to dust for my prints. Ema, might I request a scientific investigation? Ema: That's what I'm here for! Just leave it to me! Alright, we're all set! Go ahead, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Wait... You want me to do it? Ema: Of course. Who else but Mr. Edgeworth would be up to the task? Here, I'll show you how it's done! Edgeworth: Umm... Alright, then. (You're the scientist, why don't you just do it yourself...?) Ema: First, we sprinkle some aluminum powder over the area you want to investigate. Like this. Edgeworth: (Touch the screen to sprinkle the aluminum powder.) Ema: The powder will adhere to the fingerprints, so once you've sprinkled enough... ...you blow it away! Edgeworth: Blow it away? Ema: Yeah, just blow on it, with your breath. Fwooosh. Edgeworth: (Blow the powder away by blowing into the microphone.) Ema: Got it? Edgeworth: Yes, I think so. (I guess we'll do it for real this time...) Ema: Just so you know, the key point is to sprinkle the powder all over. Obtain fingerprint Leads to: \"We got one! That's a nice, clean fingerprint!\" Ema: We got one! That's a nice, clean fingerprint! Edgeworth: Let's run the prints against mine posthaste. Ema: Alright! Just leave it to me! These are definitely your fingerprints, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Well, it seems to me that we have just proven your statement to be a lie. Simeon: Ugh! Lang: What were you doing when you were driving this truck around? Simeon: Just... taking it for a joyride? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Kay was abducted two nights ago. Your balloon was sighted not far from the scene. Today, there was another kidnapping, in which a garbage truck was used... ...and once again, your truck was seen nearby. Simeon: Simeon: This all sounds like nothing more than a pure coincidence to me... Edgeworth: So it was pure coincidence that you parked near two separate kidnappings? I doubt that. You were involved in both kidnappings, weren't you? Simeon: Isn't it a bit rash to automatically assume that the two kidnappings were connected? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And what if I had evidence to prove that the two crimes were performed by the same culprit? Simeon: Oh! You're serious!? I can't wait to hear this! Edgeworth: What did Kay and Shaun's kidnappings have in common? Present Sleeping Drugs Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Kay was knocked out with a powerful sleeping drug.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence shows that the same culprit was behind both kidnappings! Simeon: Oh? And just what part of that evidence shows that, exactly? Edgeworth: Hmm. I'd say... around here? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Try to sound a bit more confident, will ya!? Simeon: Gyahahaha! You don't actually have a clue what you're talking about, do you? Edgeworth: ...Ugh! (He saw through me...) Kay: If the same culprit was behind both kidnapping cases, he must have used the same method... Let's look at the evidence related to the kidnappings again! Edgeworth: Right. Perhaps then all will become clear. Simeon: What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Run out of evidence? Edgeworth: No. I have evidence, and I can prove that the culprit in both kidnappings was the same! Leads back to: \"What did Kay and Shaun's kidnappings have in common?\" Edgeworth: Kay was knocked out with a powerful sleeping drug. And a bottle of sleeping drugs was found lying in the place where Shaun was confined. The contents of the bottle were a match with the drugs used on Kay. Simeon: Simeon: ......So that's all you've got, huh? And here I was, getting my hopes up. So the same sleeping drugs were used. So what? You think that connects the two incidents? Surely, you must realize it yourself? That doesn't prove a thing. Edgeworth: Ngh...! (Th-There must be something... Evidence that proves he is connected to those cases...!) Simeon: The police, prosecutors, and even you, Mr. Edgeworth. In the end, you're all the same. You make up evidence as you see fit, just so you can send some poor soul to prison. Isn't there someone like that here? A poor soul who was wrongly accused in the past? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You're wrong! Wh... Who would do such a thing!? Simeon: Simeon: Then show me the evidence! If you're going to accuse me of a crime, it's only natural! Edgeworth: (Ngh......... It's no use. I can't seem to find any other threads linking him to the kidnappings...!) Simeon: Now then. Have you finally run out of ammo, Mr. Edgeworth? I still have preparations to make at the circus, so if you'll excuse me... Ray: Ray: Now, now, you two... No need to get so heated. And Simeon... You're looking good in that clown makeup! Simeon: H-Hey, what's your deal!? Don't just butt in like that... Ray: Uncle Ray's not so good in such a stiff environment. I mean, why so serious, right? Hey, Kay! How about a little trick? Kay: At last, my moment has arrived! The Great Kay Faraday presents... a Simeon impression! \"O-Objectiooon...!\" Simeon: Wha... Wh-Why you! Enough already! Ray: ...Psst. Hey, Miles. I'm buying you some time to get all your ducks in a row. There's probably a better way to stall for time than this, but whatevs. Woo! Nice one, Kay! Edgeworth: (I'm not so sure about this method, either... ...but I have to find something that connects Simeon to the case... And I need to find it now! Is there evidence not related to the kidnapping that's connected to the mastermind's identity? That's it...! The mastermind is the same person as the young acolyte Kanis was looking for. If I can just connect the young acolyte to Simeon... Which piece of evidence could be connected with the mastermind's true identity...?) Present Correspondence Chess Memo Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Knightley and Kanis both communicated through a certain individual...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I've found it...! This is the evidence that connects you to the case! Simeon: Really, now? That's interesting. Well then, show me how it's connected! Edgeworth: Hmph... Leave it to me. If you hold it like this, and turn it this way... Kay: \"Too baaad! Epic fall, Mr. Edgewooorth!\" Edgeworth: Gwooooh! (Wh-Whose side are you on, anyways...? Something... I have to find something! It simply must exist! Evidence that shows the mastermind is connected to those involved in this case...!) Leads back to: \"(Which piece of evidence could be connected with the mastermind's true identity...?)\" Edgeworth: Knightley and Kanis both communicated through a certain individual... Kanis: Oh...? Then that somebody must be... Edgeworth: ...the mastermind behind the case. Edgeworth: (That's it... The mastermind played a role in the correspondence chess... If I can prove that it was Simeon, then...!) Simeon: That's enough. I can't stomach any more of your sorry excuse for a performance. If you have no more objections, then I ask that you let me get back to preparing for the show. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...Thank you for the help, Mr. Shields. (Though you may have taken it a little too far...) Ray: You sure look happy. I take it you've found something? Kay: \"Look at me! I'm Zimon! Zimon ze Klown...! Ze funny, funny klown!\" Edgeworth: Kay, you can stop now. Now then... Mr. Saint. Do you happen to like chess? Simeon: Hmph. That was rather out-of-the-blue. But since you asked, I can't say that I dislike chess. Edgeworth: The mastermind played correspondence chess with Bodhidharma Kanis. Simeon: Simeon: If I recall, it was Knightley who had been playing chess with Kanis, wasn't it? Are you saying that he was the mastermind? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There was no way Knightley could have been the mastermind. The reason being... ...the mastermind had continued to work behind the scenes even after Knightley's death. That being the case, who could have written this letter? I believe someone acted as the middleman between Kanis and Knightley. Simeon: So, you're saying that you think I'm the middleman? Ha ha ha! And just why would I have to go to all that trouble and do something like that? Edgeworth: Most likely, to make it appear as if there was a connection between Knightley and Kanis. And, as a result... Knightley was killed by Fifi Laguarde. Kay: N-No way! Are you saying it was all set up so that he would be killed by her!? Simeon: Simeon: What are you saying!? There's no way I could manipulate a person that far! Look at me! It takes all I have just to get the animals to perform tricks! Edgeworth: (If only just a scrap of the letters he exchanged with Knightley still remained... ...it'd be decisive evidence!) I'd like to investigate your room. There could be decisive... Simeon: Simeon: If it's the letters you're looking for, you won't find any in there. Edgeworth: What!? Simeon: I'm the type of guy who throws his letters away as soon as he's done reading them. Where's the point in living in the past? Edgeworth: (Ngh! Does that mean he's already gotten rid of the evidence...!?) Simeon: Mr. Edgeworth... Everything you have said so far has been nothing more than baseless conjecture. Edgeworth: (The evidence... I'm just one step behind it! What should I do? Am I all out of moves...?) Simeon: Without evidence, I won't allow you to cast doubt on my friendship with Knightley! Edgeworth: Wh-Who was that? Regina: Ah! Excuse me! Edgeworth: (Ms. Berry? What's on her mind?) Regina: I've been... listening in on what you all were saying, and, umm... When you say Mr. Knightley... You mean Simeon's friend, Mr. Knightley, right? Edgeworth: Yes, that's correct... (Does she know something?) Regina: This morning, a letter arrived from Mr. Knightley. It was for Simeon. Edgeworth: What!? Simeon: What did you say...!? Edgeworth: (But that's impossible! Knightley's already dead...!) Ms. Berry! Please, let me see that letter! Regina: OK! Here you go. Kay: Quick, open it! Edgeworth: This is... a correspondence chess letter! Kay: This is the response to Kanis's last move! Knightley: Now, can you see the path to checkmate? I can't wait to see the look on your face... You weren't expecting to lose at chess against me, right? Edgeworth: The postmark says March 26th... The day before Knightley's death. It seems the letter arrived late. Regina: Since the circus moves around so much, a lot of the mail people send us arrive late. Edgeworth: Now, why was this letter addressed to you? Simeon: .....Ngh! Edgeworth: This is proof that you were the middleman between Kanis and Knightley. Normally, you would transcribe this letter into braille before sending it to Kanis. And in doing so, you created a connection between him and Knightley! Simeon: Dammiiiiiit! Curse you, Knightley! Why must you continue to interfere!? Kay: Simeon... Why!? Wasn't Knightley your only friend? Simeon: Hah! Don't be ridiculous. I stopped thinking of him as a friend 18 years ago. Edgeworth: 18 years ago...? Would that have been the day of the IS-7 Incident? Simeon: ...Thanks to Knightley, I nearly died that day in the snowstorm. While I was on my way to the contest venue, where my father was waiting... ...Knightley suddenly appeared. He held me down... tied up my hands and feet, and with tears streaming down his face... ...he kept apologizing, \"My dad's too scary, I can't disobey him. Please forgive me! I'm sorry!\" Simeon: Stop it, Horace! I promised my dad! I said I'd taste his desserts... If I'm not there, Dad will be in trouble! I'm gonna let everyone know my Dad's desserts are the best in the world...! Simeon: After that, he locked us inside a car. It was so cold, I could see my own breath. Before we knew it, the doors had frozen shut, and not even he could get them open. And then... I lost my father! Edgeworth: Wha...! Kay: Your father...! Simeon: Horace Knightley was the son of the murderer who killed my father! Edgeworth: (What could this mean? His confession runs contrary to the information we have...) Ray: But the name of the victim in the IS-7 Incident was Isaac Dover... Simeon: Isaac Dover is my father's name. 18 years ago, my memories were muddled from the shock of my near-death experience... So it wasn't until later that I learned the truth. On that day, my father was murdered. Edgeworth: ...The culprit of the IS-7 Incident was a confectioner by the name of Dane Gustavia. Simeon: Heh... So that was the name of Knightley's father. That lowlife scum of the earth killed my father. Just the thought of him makes me sick. Edgeworth: So you knew who the culprit was all along? Simeon: Hah... Of course not. Had I known, I would've tipped off the police a long time ago. All I knew was that Knightley's father was trying to set up my own father. That's why I immediately knew that the one who died that day was my dad. Knightley had a hand in my father's murder, that traitor! He was the son of a killer! It's only natural that he ended up dead! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...It would appear that you are a victim of a very serious misunderstanding. Simeon: Misunderstanding...? Just what're you talking about? Edgeworth: Isaac Dover... At the time, he was actively working as a sculptor in France... ...under the name Pierre Hoquet. Simeon: Is that right? Well, I'm sorry to say, I don't remember that at all. Edgeworth: Heh... It's only natural you don't remember. After all, he's not your real father. Simeon: ...Huh? What, is that supposed to be a joke? I am not amused. Edgeworth: Hmph... You won't be able to laugh at all, once I reveal the truth to you. This piece of evidence proves that you are not Isaac Dover's son! Present Knightley's Mementos Edgeworth: Leads to: \"What's that? Isn't that Knightley's chessboard and his ring?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Simeon: What's that supposed to tell me? Edgeworth: Can't you see? This shows that you and Dover aren't... Simeon: Simeon: Mr. Edgeworth. That doesn't prove anything. I honestly don't have a clue what you're trying to get at. Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (It seems I was wrong...) Ray: Hang in there, Miles. Who was really Mr. Dover's son...? If you keep calm and think it through, the answer should come naturally. Edgeworth: (Isaac Dover's real son...?) Simeon: Mr. Edgeworth. Stop joking around. There's no doubt that I'm Isaac Dover's son. Edgeworth: No. I'm sorry, Mr. Saint, but that's just simply not possible. Leads back to: \"This piece of evidence proves that you are not Isaac Dover's son!\" Simeon: What's that? Isn't that Knightley's chessboard and his ring? Edgeworth: I want you to take a good look at this ring's design. Simeon: ...There are two letters inscribed in it. Edgeworth: That is the seal Pierre Hoquet used as his signature. 18 years ago, it was found lying near the body of Isaac Dover. Simeon: ! Wh... Why would Knightley have my father's memento with him!? Edgeworth: The police had found Isaac Dover's son and gave it to him. Isaac Dover's real son... is Horace Knightley. Simeon: Wh... What!? B-But that means, I'm...! Edgeworth: In other words... you are Dane Gustavia's son! Simeon: That's... that's a lie! After all, I'm... My... father is.....! My memories are.....! I lost my father because Knightley locked me up in the car...! That's why, I thought it would be fitting if he were killed as well! Knightley: Really!? I'll be able to see a circus show, even in prison? Heh. I enjoy playing chess with you, but I'm looking forward to your performance as well. Simeon: ......Yes. Please look forward to it. Knightley: Alright! You better drop by again. I'll be thinking about my next move! Simeon: Oh yeah. I've left something special inside that chessboard for you. You should check it out later. Knightley: Something special? I'm not quite sure what you mean, but thanks. I owe you one, Simeon. Simeon: ......If only you hadn't stopped me 18 years ago... ...it wouldn't have had... to come to this. Knightley: Huh? Did you say something? Simeon: Nope. Not a word. ......Goodbye, Horace. Simeon: After all that...! You're saying it was my father who killed Knightley's? Then, that means... Was it all for nothing...!? I didn't want to become some weakling who could be killed by anyone... That's why... I thought I'd follow in Mr. Kanis's footsteps! Edgeworth: This finally proves it... Simeon Saint! You are Kanis's correspondence chess partner... ...and the mastermind behind this case! Simeon: ............ GYAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That's right! It was me! I'm the mastermind behind it all! Edgeworth: (He's finally showing his true colors...!) Simeon: As you all know, I witnessed the incident 12 years ago. Edgeworth: (President Huang's assassination...! So the child who drew that picture was Simeon Saint...) Simeon: When I was found out... ...I was subjected to horrible interrogations over and over by that heartless Fifi. I'd spend the nights trembling in my bed, terrified of what the next day would bring! I'm sure you can understand why I'd want to sneak out of there, right? Edgeworth: However... Blaise would have likely sent pursuers after you. Simeon: Exactly. I was on the run from them every waking moment. 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. I couldn't even sleep at night, I'd jump at the slightest noise. ...And that's why I became a circus performer. Blaise Debeste was the Chief Prosecutor, and Fifi Laguarde was the warden of the prison. No ordinary person would be a match for those two. And there were no adults I could rely on. Furthermore, behind the scenes was the body double who had set those two in motion. Though he was a fake, I was up against a nation's president... Talk about utter despair, right? My only ally was Mr. Kanis... He saved my life, after all. He actually helped me out. Unlike Knightley. Edgeworth: (If this story is true... Hmph. It's ironic. Kanis, the fiendish assassin, was idolized by the child he saved.) Simeon: If I followed in his footsteps, I'd no longer have to worry about being eaten alive. That's right. Now it's my turn... My turn to devour those who would feed upon me! Edgeworth: And I suppose you never thought to seek help from the police. Simeon: Nowaynoway! As long as Blaise was around, any evidence would be destroyed by him. Actually, didn't something like that almost happen today during Fifi's trial? I knew from the very beginning. That things would turn out like this. Edgeworth: (The evidence from Fifi Laguarde's trial... So he's saying that he expected the evidence would be destroyed...) I see. So that's why you kidnapped Shaun... ...to force a Guilty verdict, even in the absense of evidence! Simeon: Simeon: Who's to say. But, in order to expose the crimes of 12 years ago, there was no other choice. Edgeworth: That's according to you. However, Blaise also... ...attempted to kidnap Shaun in order to manipulate the trial in his favor... Your methods are no different than those of the people you so despise! Simeon: Simeon: That's only if I were actually the kidnapper. But I would never do anything so evil. Nowaynowaynoway, I just simply couldn't! Besides, Mr. Edgeworth. I'm actually quite thankful to the real criminals... ...for giving me the opportunity to extract such sweet revenge! Ke he heh... Gyahahahahahaha! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...So you admit it. Your motive was revenge. Simeon: Yeah, I admit it. So what? Sure, I held a grudge against those creeps. But... it's not like I'm the one who actually killed them, ya know? Edgeworth: .....! Simeon: Truth be told, all I did was send some letters. I let Jill in on Blaise's secrets, and let Blaise in on Jill's secrets. And then, the two simply ended up trying to kill each other. Gravelle: Do you mean to say the murder was nothing more than a result of that!? Simeon: Yep! Just like the case at Gourd Lake. It's way easier than trying to control wild animals. All I did was come up with the fake assassination plan for Knightley. Edgeworth: (So that was also a part of his plan...!) If that's the case, then Rooke's murder was also your... Simeon: Simeon: Whoa! Don't try to pin that on me. Knightley killed him all on his own. Well, it ended up creating the perfect opportunity for me... It's funny how things work out! Kay: How can you say such a thing...!? Simeon: It was the same for Fifi Laguarde. I made it look like there was a connection between Knightley and Kanis... ...by using the correspondence chess match and the chisel in the chessboard. Edgeworth: What!? You mean to say that you were the one who prepared that chisel!? Simeon: That's right! I thought it would bring Kanis to mind. Quite a thoughtful little gift, wouldn't you agree? And that was all it took to get Fifi to murder Knightley! Oh, the feeling that everyone around you is an enemy. Heh heh. I know it all too well. The tiniest spark can set off an explosion of fear, resulting in... horrific mutual destruction. All I did was watch the comedy of errors unfold from the audience. And you were my final pawn, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: A pawn... Me...? Simeon: When you solved their cases, you brought both Blaise and Fifi to their run... ...and the weapon that delivered the coup de grâce was your own logic! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I didn't solve those cases for your sake! Simeon: Oh, I know. You never really cared about saving me. You just wanted to pretend to be a defense attorney, didn't you? Edgeworth: What did you...!? Simeon: All I had to do was go, \"nowaynowaynoway\" and act all scared... ...and you totally believed me. You were giving it your all trying to save me. Edgeworth: Ngh...! So even your arrest was just a ploy to make me use my logic...? Simeon: To be fair, getting arrested wasn't part of the plan. When people began to suspect that the chisel I sent was the murder weapon... ...honestly, I broke out in a cold sweat. I thought for sure it would be curtains for me. But then, a turnabout of miraculous proportions! The genius prosecutor himself had come to my rescue! Well? Doesn't it feel nice to be thanked by me, the one that you saved? You should be grateful! I gave you this chance to play the ace attorney! Kay: You're wrong! He wasn't pretending to be a defense attorney! Mr. Edgeworth is always serious about saving people...! Even the times when he saved me in the past...! Edgeworth: (Kay...!) Simeon: Gyahahahahahaha! Is that so? Are you sure he's not just trying to emulate his own father, the one he admires SO much!? Kay: Absolutely not! That's not true at all! Ray: Now, now, Kay. The person he's talking about now isn't Miles, but rather, Simeon himself. Clearly, he is not able to trust others. The desire to save someone other than himself is something he cannot even comprehend... Simeon: Say what you want. But make sure you think about it long and hard. Sure, all my targets for revenge got what they deserved in the end. However... -- Instigating Murder? -- Simeon: Think about it. Can any one of my actions really be considered a crime? I instigated murder? There's not a single word about that in the letter, is there? If I had said the word \"kill\" even once, I guess it could be considered instigation. Well, maybe I did say it. But there's no way for you to prove it. Kay: What are you saying!? You kidnapped me! Simeon: I'm sorry, but that hasn't been proven yet, has it? The only thing I admitted to was sending the letters. Kay: That's...! Simeon: Besides, those letters contained no threats or coercions. I simply conveyed information. Information that each recipient would find beneficial. Edgeworth: Ngh... (You crafty little...!) Kay: Can't we do something about it? Umm... what was it he said? Integrating murder? Edgeworth: Instigating murder is when a person directs someone else to commit murder. The person who directed the murder can be charged as if he committed the crime himself. Kay: So we just have to find proof that he directed those murders! Simeon: You make it sound so easy... To be honest, it kinda pisses me off a little. You're all trying to frame an innocent person for murder. Don't you understand? I'm not obligated to waste any more time on this pointless discussion. Lang: Lang: The police are waiting for you outside of this tent! You have nowhere to run! Simeon: Really now? You think I wouldn't have an escape route prepared? For example, let's say... ...I gave an order so that all the animals here attacked you! Now, what if I were to take my leave during the ensuing chaos? Lang: What'd you say!? You... can't be serious... Simeon: Gyahahahaha! It was just an example! Wouldn't that make for an interesting show? Here's another idea: what if I pulled out a hidden gun and took Shaun hostage? Mmm. That might be more exciting! Gravelle: I-I will never allow you to do such a thing! Edgeworth: (I can't tell whether or not Simeon is being serious... ...however, when it comes to him, we should consider anything a possibility!) Simeon: If you continue to bore with your drivel, I'll end the show right here. I'd like you to keep that in mind before you make any baseless objections! Edgeworth: (Ngh...! I cannot make any careless remarks...! Isn't there some way I can charge him with his crimes?) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You incited others to commit murder, and they did so. If proof of that was established, you would be charged as if you yourself committed the murders. Kay: ...Umm, I know I heard it just a while ago, but what's the technical term again? Edgeworth: It's \"instigating murder\", Kay. Blaise, Fifi Laguarde, and Knightley... Their crimes are unforgivable, of course. However, the one who pulled the strings from behind the scenes, and drove them all to murder... ...was none other than you, Simeon Saint! Simeon: Aha, aha, gyahahahahah! Mr. Edgeworth, you really do speak your mind freely. But you know... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's not... a single word? Simeon: Oh, does that surprise you? You'd reach the same conclusion if you examined it. Edgeworth: (Hmm. Given his composure... I'd say he's not bluffing. Does this mean that every single word in his letters had been carefully calculated...!?) Simeon: Well, I guess you could say this is like teaching a monkey to climb a tree. Unless you can somehow prove that I caused those murders, you've got nothing on me. ...Ergo, you can't assume me of instigating murder. Heh heh heh... What a shame, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I know you instigated the murder! ???: Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane. Edgeworth: What!? Edgeworth: You told me yourself. Simeon: Simeon: But you know, the funny thing is, it means absolutely nothing if you have no proof. I mean, there's no way I'd ever say something like that. Nowaynowaynoway! Edgeworth: (Ngh... that's certainly true. It means absolutely nothing if I can't prove it. If there was some evidence that could prove what he said over the phone...) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Maybe you did say it\"? Did you or didn't you!? Simeon: Gyahahahah! It doesn't really matter whether I did or didn't! That's not what's important. I'm sure you know full well, Mr. Edgeworth. There's no way to prove it. There's no way any proof could exist! Edgeworth: Ngh...! (Until I find some sort of proof, my arguments are meaningless. Should I press him to draw out more information, or review the evidence...? At any rate, I must find some way to break through his defense!) Kay: Is Simeon really innocent of instigating the murders? Edgeworth: That's impossible. I'm certain that it was all part of his murder plot. Kay: Yeah. Edgeworth: We know he had the will to commit the crimes... We just need some way to prove it... Edgeworth: (He confessed to me over the phone. He told me he had Blaise kill Mrs. Crane... If only there was some evidence that could prove what he said over the phone...-- Instigating Murder? -- Simeon: Think about it. Can any one of my actions really be considered a crime?

Present Nicole's Tape Recorder Edgeworth: Leads to: \"It is my firm conviction that you instigated the murders.\" Before pressing third statement Kay: Is Simeon really innocent of instigating the murders? Edgeworth: That's impossible. I'm certain that it was all part of his murder plot. Kay: Yeah. Edgeworth: We know he had the will to commit the crimes... We just need some way to prove it... After pressing third statement Edgeworth: (He confessed to me over the phone. He told me he had Blaise kill Mrs. Crane...

Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane. Edgeworth: What!? Simeon: Did I say that? I really don't remember. Edgeworth: You may think you can deceive us as much as you want... ...but unfortunately for you... Simeon: Unfortunately...? Edgeworth: You used a bug to eavesdrop on our conversations... ...but there was someone else who wiretapped that bug of yours and recorded the whole thing. Simeon: It was... recorded? Lang: In other words, the conversation between you and that clown is recorded on that tape!? Simeon: Ngh.......! Lang: Lang Zi says: \"A schemer drowns in his own schemes!\" And this is what he meant! Edgeworth: Ms. Swift. I'd like to listen to your tape. Nicole: Rooooger! Ah! It's right about here! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Judge Gravelle's cellphone is ringing! Edgeworth: Who is this? ...Are you the person who ambushed Kay? Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! I wanna listen in on this too! Edgeworth: Very well. Edgeworth: (This is where it starts...) ???: Well, I must say...... .............. Nicole: Huh? That's odd... Edgeworth: What's wrong? Nicole: Well... there ain't nothin' recorded past this point! Edgeworth: Whaaaaaaaat!? Kay: Why!? Why wasn't it recorded!? Simeon: .......Keh heh heh heh. Gyahahahahahahahahah! Too bad, so sad. Did you really think I'd leave behind any incriminating evidence? The bug I planted has a special feature. It can be turned on and off with a remote control. Kay: Whaaaaat!? That sort of thing exists!? Lang: Certainly, remote controlled listening devices do exist. However... Gravelle: Are you saying you switched off the device so that your own voice would not be recorded? Simeon: Precisely! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Impossible! You couldn't have done that unless you knew you were being recorded...! Simeon: Simeon: Isn't it obvious I knew? I guess you just don't get it. ...You could call it a hunch. I had a feeling I was being wiretapped. Ms. Swift... was it? I figured things out because you knew about the kidnapping. Edgeworth: (Don't tell me...) You were listening in on that conversation!? Simeon: That's right! Though come to think of it... I'm surprised you didn't realize it until now! Some genius prosecutor you turned out to be, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Ngh! Simeon: Oh my? And what was the end result of all this? Ah! Since you don't have any proof of the instigation charges, it's Game Over. Edgeworth: Ngh... Nicole: Mr. Prosecutor, was my recordin' no help to you at all? Ain't there... somethin'... anythin' at all in my recordin'...? Edgeworth: (Ms. Swift...) Ray: Kay. Kay: Y-Yes? Ray: The bug was planted in your badge, right? Do you have any ideas? Kay: How do you expect me to come up with an answer right off the top of my head!? Franziska: You were the only one who came into contact with the culprit! Simeon: Simeon: How unsightly. You're all fussing over useless evidence. Let's move on to the next topic! Next! Edgeworth: (What's this...? He seems a bit eager to change the topic of conversation...?) Franziska: You were the only one who came into contact with the culprit! Edgeworth: (Only Kay... came into contact with Simeon... If any sound was recorded at the time she was with the culprit...) Ms. Swift! How long have you been recording? Nicole: Since two nights ago, I reckon... Edgeworth: (Since two nights ago... In that case... When could a conversation with Simeon possibly have been recorded?) Two nights ago Leads to: \"(Two nights ago... Simeon brought Kay to the roof.)\" Last night Edgeworth: Ms. Swift! Could we listen to last night's recording? Nicole: Last night? I don't mind, but... Edgeworth: The culprit's conversation should have been recorded at that time. Ray: Miles! Last night, Kay was... ...with you! That would make you seem like the culprit! Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (It seems I was wrong...) Nicole: Mr. Prosecutor, was my recordin' no help to you after all? Edgeworth: (At the time when Kay was kidnapped by the culprit... ...it's possible the bug may have picked up the culprit's voice. In which case, the culprit's conversation should still be left on the tape!) Leads back to: \"(When could a conversation with Simeon possibly have been recorded?)\" This morning Edgeworth: Ms. Swift! Could we listen to this morning's recording? Nicole: This morning? Sure, that's fine, but... Kay: Didn't you have my badge with you this morning, Mr. Edgeworth? And also, don't forget that you were inside the detention cell... So wouldn't your voice be the only one on there? Edgeworth: Nwaaargh! (I had forgotten that...) Nicole: Mr. Prosecutor, was my recordin' no help to you after all? Edgeworth: (At the time when Kay was kidnapped by the culprit... ...it's possible the bug may have picked up the culprit's voice. In which case, the culprit's conversation should still be left on the tape!) Leads back to: \"(When could a conversation with Simeon possibly have been recorded?)\" Edgeworth: (Two nights ago... Simeon brought Kay to the roof. If we listen to the recording from that time frame...!) Ms. Swift! Please let us listen to the recording from two nights ago! Nicole: Huh? O-Okie-dokie! ........ Kay: Th-This is...! The sound of a hot air balloon! Edgeworth: That's right. At the time, Simeon was carrying Kay in a hot air balloon. Ergo, he was near Kay. Simeon: ........ Edgeworth: (Isn't there anything recorded?) ........ .....*BANG*... *CLANG* Kay: Ah! Th-That was...! Lang: ...a-a gunshot! Simeon: ........ ...*vrrr*... *bzt* Edgeworth: Heh. It seems you were quick to deactivate the bug. However... you were a little too late. You can't run anymore. That gunshot ties you to the case! Simeon: Huh? What are you saying? There's no gun involved in this case, is there? Edgeworth: (No... there should be someone connected to the case who fired a gun. Let's strike with the evidence that points to that person!) Which piece of evidence connects the gunshot to the case? Present Crime Scene Notes Edgeworth: Leads to: \"It's written right here, in the body double's autopsy report...\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Simeon: What's that supposed to tell me? Edgeworth: Could you perhaps take a look at this piece of evidence? Simeon: Are you saying that this proves a gun is related to the case? Edgeworth: ...That is what I believe. Are you saying that I'm wrong? Simeon: Gyahahahah! I don't think it has any connection at all! Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (It seems this wasn't it.) Ray: This isn't like you, Miles! Think about it a little harder! Edgeworth: ...I-I'm sorry. Kay: The person who fired the gun could be the same person who kidnapped me, right? Edgeworth: That's possible. However... It seems we can't be sure. To see if there is something that connects those involved in the case with a gun... ...we should review the evidence once more. Simeon: What are you mumbling about? As I thought, the gun isn't related at all, is it? Edgeworth: No, the gunshot that was recorded is greatly related to this case. Leads back to: \"Which piece of evidence connects the gunshot to the case?\" Edgeworth: It's written right here, in the body double's autopsy report... Gunpowder residue was detected on his right hand. Simeon: ...Ngh. Edgeworth: Where was Kay at the time this gunshot was recorded? That's right. She was being carried to the roof of the Grand Tower in your balloon. And as it turns out, there were a few more people on that very same rooftop at the time... Gravelle: You mean the double and me... Ah! Certainly, after we talked for a brief moment... ...the body double noticed something and had me leave before him. Edgeworth: Now, what if the gunshot rang out after that? We clearly hear it in the recording. I doubt that you wouldn't have noticed it. Simeon: ....... Edgeworth: Do you intend to feign ignorance until the very end? Simeon: That's nothing more than mere conjecture. Lang: Lang: What we heard on the recording was not just a gunshot... .....*BANG*... *CLANG* Lang: If you listen closely, you can hear the bullet hitting something! Edgeworth: (If the body double was aiming at Simeon, then...) The bullet may have struck which piece of evidence? Present Lion Balloon Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The body double likely fired the gun at the balloon.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Kay: Ehhh!? Did the bullet really hit that thing? Simeon: Gyahahahah! That surprised me too! Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. It looks like he's totally clowning around with you. Well... I don't think that's the right evidence either. Edgeworth: Nnghhooh! (To be rebutted this much...) Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. Do you really understand? If you think about who the double was aiming at, the answer should be clear. Edgeworth: Indeed. The bullet could only have hit that piece of evidence. Leads back to: \"The bullet may have struck which piece of evidence?\" Edgeworth: The body double likely fired the gun at the balloon. If we assume that the bullet hit something... it would have been the balloon's basket. Kay: Let's examine it immediately! Examine basket Edgeworth: This basket needs to be examined from every angle. Please be thorough. Kay: Yep! I'll start with this end! Lang: Hey! You guys give 'em a hand! MIB: Yes, Shifu! Kay: .....Aww, nothing here. Did you guys find anything on your end? MIB: Nothing at all! Not a even single speck of dust! Edgeworth: (Hmm. I expected as much. The sound made on impact... ...sounded more metallic than anything the basket's woven material could produce...) Examine rope on inside Kay: There's a long rope all coiled up inside. Edgeworth: We must examine it closely for any signs of it being cut by a bullet. Kay: Got it! Mr. MIB, you start from that end! MIB: Y-Yeah! Nothing here... or here... Nope! There's no sign of it being hit by a bullet! Kay: There's nothing on this end either. I guess it didn't hit the rope. Edgeworth: Let's not waste any time. On to the next spot. Examine gas tank on inside Edgeworth: There's a gas tank here. It's attached to the basket. Kay: Umm... I don't think we would be looking at this tank right now if a bullet had hit it. In fact, neither Simeon or I would still be here. We would have been blown sky high. Edgeworth: Let's look elsewhere, then. Examine bullet hole on under Leads to: \"This hole...!\" Edgeworth: This hole...! Kay: It's a bullet hole! Edgeworth: A bullet hole was found in the basket. You won't be able to talk your way out of this one. Lion Balloon data updated in my Organizer. Simeon: Ngh! Examine evidence Basket on Lion Balloon Kay: I... took a ride in this basket, didn't I? Edgeworth: Indeed. You had been drugged, so it would make sense if you don't remember it. Kay: Aww... He could have at least kept me awake so I could enjoy the hot air balloon ride. I'll never forgive you, Mr. Mastermind! Beat him to a pulp, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: I'm sorry to disappoint, Kay, but if I did that I would be arrested for battery... Rope on inside of Lion Balloon Kay: Once we've proven he's the culprit, let's tie him up with this rope! As an expert in rope escapes, I know how to make knots that can never be untied! Edgeworth: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but handcuffs seem like a more reliable alternative. Gas tank on inside of Lion Balloon Kay: Never fear! I'll guard the gas tank! I'll stop Simeon from trying to escape with the balloon! Edgeworth: I... find it hard to imagine that he would try a stunt like that. Kay: Never fear! Just focus on putting him behind bars, Mr. Edgeworth! Bullet hole on under Lion Balloon Edgeworth: The gunshot fired by the body double was recorded on the tape. And this was where the bullet hit its mark. There's no way Simeon can deny that now! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, you absolutely HAVE to expose the truth! I even got kidnapped in order to steal this evidence! Edgeworth: (Leaving aside whether or not I would call that \"stealing\"...) Of course, that was my intention all along. I absolutely won't let him escape! Edgeworth: How do you intend to explain the gunshot and bullet hole? Simeon: Keh heh heh. So you've figured it out. You're good. I guess it's impossible to hide anything from you. Lang: Spit it out already! Simeon: OK, OK. No need to be impatient! -- Two Nights Ago -- Simeon: It happened when I was riding the balloon to the rooftop. I saw the body double and you, Ms. Gravelle, on the roof. Talk about a surprise. Only the double noticed me. He told Ms. Gravelle to leave ahead of him. He then pointed a gun at me and fired. Kay: Why did he want to shoot down the balloon? Simeon: It's simple. The body double had intended to kill Ms. Gravelle. Gravelle: K-Kill me...? Simeon: That's right! You talked to the double about Shaun, didn't you? Well, it's not like the body double would have met with you otherwise... From his point of view, it was like showing him evidence that he was a fake. Edgeworth: You mean, he was afraid of Judge Gravelle because she knew about Shaun's past? Simeon: Afraid... That's exactly right! That body double was a coward, after all. I even remember how his hands were trembling when he fired the gun at my balloon. Are we all clear now? I was only there by chance. Just a friendly witness who was passing by. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Around what time was that? Simeon: I think it was around 11 PM. It should coincidence with the time Ms. Gravelle and company were on the roof, right? Gravelle: ...Yes. It was indeed around that time. Edgeworth: (There doesn't seem to be any contradictions... However, the time frame is important.) Simeon: And it was at that moment... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you saying this rooftop rendezvous was beyond your expectations? Simeon: There's no way I could've known about that beforehand. Well, once the dust settled, I could guess what would've happened though. The double had intended to kill Ms. Gravelle. Hey, did you realize that? Gravelle: N-No. I did not... realize it. Simeon: It's because you were blabbing on and on about that kid. Gravelle: Th-That's...... I... Uugh...! Simeon: What kinda mother are you? If things had gone badly, your kid might've died because of you! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm your opponent, not her. Don't change the conversation! ...Judge Gravelle. I'd like you to please leave this to me. Gravelle: My apologies, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Oh, Goddess of Law... ...please watch over this man and grant him aid! Simeon: Hahaha! You're making me laugh. This lady didn't even notice the balloon. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: He had her leave ahead of him? Didn't you say the body double had planned to kill her? Simeon: Maybe he thought it would be bad if someone saw the scene of the murder? At the time, no one knew that the president was a fake, right? Once he got the info on Shaun, he'd be able to kill both mother and son whenever he wanted. Thank goodness he's dead! Now you're both safe. You should be happy. Gyaha... hahahahahahah! Edgeworth: Whatever emotions you have towards that man, please put them aside until it's all over. For now, please continue your story. Simeon: Keh heh heh... As you wish. And so, that cowardly body double... ...must have panicked when an eyewitness suddenly appeared from the skies. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The bullet struck the balloon's basket cleanly... Simeon: I panicked and quickly tried to get away so he wouldn't shoot me down, but... ...talk about a close call. Edgeworth: You say you tried to get away right then? Simeon: That's right. Is there a problem? Edgeworth: (Is there a problem with his statement?) There is a problem Leads to: \"You must have placed Kay on the rooftop.\" There is no problem Edgeworth: No... there is no problem. Simeon: I see. In that case, it's fine. Edgeworth: You must have placed Kay on the rooftop. You couldn't have gotten away before then, correct? Simeon: ...Yeah. That's right. I forgot. After the body double fired one shot, he entered the hatch to the 51st floor. I looked around for a bit, and then landed on the roof. Edgeworth: Please add that statement to your testimony. Simeon: Sure, I don't mind... Add statement: \"After the double fired one shot, he entered the hatch to the 51st floor.\" Leads to: \"You must have placed Kay on the rooftop.\" Edgeworth: No... there is no problem. Simeon: I see. In that case, it's fine. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Surely, you must have been surprised. So what did you do? Simeon: What else could I do in that situation? I tried to get away as quickly as I could. But, that body double... He's nothing but a coward hiding behind a steel gun. Kay: ...Inside his plane at Gourd Lake, he had tons of personal security goods as well. Edgeworth: It is said that when a coward is backed into a corner, they can become aggressive. Simeon: Oh. If that's the case, are you going to get more aggressive now, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Sorry to disappoint, but I try not to become aggressive or defensive. Instead... I attack when I need to be forceful, and defend when a delicate touch is needed. Back to the matter at hand, could you testify about the body double's actions? Simeon: Hmph... don't be so cold, man. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean the hatch that leads to the hidden storeroom for the black market auction? Kay: Black market auction... Huh? I don't really want to remember, but... that was 2 days ago, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. The black market auction was held on the 50th floor of the Grand Tower. Kay: A lot of people must have been coming and going through the storeroom during the incident... Edgeworth: Indeed. If the double truly did enter the storeroom as Simeon said... ...it's strange that no one noticed him! (The problem here is when this incident occurred... If we know the precise moment, then a certain piece of evidence may come in handy.) Edgeworth: (Eyewitness testimony from the balloon...) Kay: So that means, if Simeon hadn't come... Edgeworth: ...Judge Gravelle would probably have been in danger. Kay: So, wouldn't that mean he saved her life!? Edgeworth: The motive behind Mr. Saint' actions was probably not so noble. After all, this man was there to commit a crime just like the fake president. (To expose his crimes, I'll need to listen carefully to his testimony...

You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "The contradiction lies between Simeon's testimony and the evidence regarding the truck and the balloon usage. Simeon claims in his testimony that \"The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago,\" and that the truck has been parked behind the dressing rooms since two days ago. However, Evidence 13 (Blue Truck) shows that the truck was seen driving by Edgeworth today (which implies it was used today, not two days ago).\n\nThis creates a direct contradiction: Simeon claims he last used the truck two days ago and it has been parked since then, but the truck was witnessed being driven today.\n",

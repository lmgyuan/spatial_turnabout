I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini? Maya: I finally get to see you again, and... Phoenix: It's not your fault. You didn't do it. Maya: No, I... I did it... I killed that person. Phoenix: But that wasn't you. Maya: It doesn't matter. It might as well have been me. Phoenix: (I can't believe something like this happened...The events of that gloomy, rainy afternoon that started this whole mess...keep playing through my mind...) Episode 2Reunion, and Turnabout June 16, 3:34 PMWright & Co. Law Offices ???: What depressing rain... Do you understand how depressed that makes me!? Do you!? Phoenix: Uh, I guess... ???: But actually, more than being depressed, I'm angry. Angry at that weather girl on TV. \"I think our little rainy spell will take a break with a day of sun!\"...is what that girl said! I'd stake my life on it! Phoenix: Well, it's the weather... ???: But that's why I didn't bother to bring an umbrella today. What nerve, calling herself a weather girl! She's going to hear about my $1500 suit! Phoenix: Um... About your case... Unless you're planning on suing the weather girl...? ???: ... I'm sorry. I thought that before we got down to business, we could have some friendly chatter. My name is Dr. Turner Grey. I'm a surgeon. Phoenix: (Remind me never to end up under his knife...) Grey: I'm here today because of this incident. Phoenix: \"Malpractice at Grey Surgical Clinic. Fourteen In-Patients Lose Their Lives!\" ...Oh. You're... the doctor at...? Grey: It's really quite upsetting. Did you hear me!? UPSETTING! Phoenix: Yes, yes, I heard you. I agree, it's quite upsetting, Dr. Grey. Grey: The one that screwed up was that nurse! It was her that got the medications mixed up and killed those 14 patients! And yet! Now listen good! And yet! That nurse had the nerve to go and die before admitting to her wrongdoing! She didn't even offer any sort of explanation to me! And this is the kicker! She up and has herself a grand ol' accident and crashed her car! Smash! Crunch! Instantly transforming her car into the accordion model! Phoenix: (That's right... About a year ago, all the tabloid shows were talking about it. Fourteen victims of medical malpractice and the nurse's mysterious fatal accident. There were rumors that Dr. Grey had actually caused that crash. People said it was to forever hide the person responsible for the malpractice incident.) Grey: Why would I...? Now, I'm just going to say this once -- Why on Earth would I want to kill that nurse? She's the one who killed those 14 patients! Not me! Phoenix: I think you need to take a deep breath, doctor, and focus... More to the point, this case is over a year old. Why bring it up now...? Grey: That's simple! Because the situation is slipping out of my grasp. This just won't do. My clinic isn't seeing nearly as many patients nowadays. Do you understand what that means!? It means they're not coming to my clinic! Phoenix: (You don't say...? If it were me, I don't think I'd want to go either.) So... what would you like me to do about it...? Grey: I want you to help me prove I'm innocent. Phoenix: Um, you do realize I'm a lawyer, not a private investigator, right? Grey: No, this is something only you can do. Phoenix: ...? Grey: Maya Fey. You know this girl, correct? Phoenix: ...! (Maya! Why would he know her name...!?) Grey: I heard you were working under her for a little while. Phoenix: Well, yes... I mean... Hey, wait a second here! I worked UNDER her!? Grey: Yes. Am I wrong? She told me, so I'm not quite sure if... Phoenix: Well, we worked a few trials together. But she went back to her hometown to undergo more training. Grey: Ah, yes, I heard. It must be lonely for you. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Wait... I'm not...! Grey: She must be an extraordinary girl to handle such rigid training. Phoenix: Huh? Grey: I have an acquaintance who knows a lot about these mystical sorts of things. She's the one who introduced me to Ms. Fey. Phoenix: (Is Maya... really that famous...?) Grey: And I've already set up an appointment. Phoenix: For what? Grey: What else!? A channeling! I'm going to have her call the spirit of that nurse that went and got herself killed! Phoenix: O-Oh. (Maya... I wonder what she's up to right now...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey clan have always been spirit mediums. (Changed from [We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums.] in the original release) It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (That's what she told me... I guess she's learned to accept her responsibilities and become an adult...) Grey: Not counting training, this will be her first time channeling a spirit, so she gave me one condition before accepting my request. Phoenix: A condition...? Grey: The condition is you, Mr. Wright. She said that she wouldn't do the channeling without first seeing you again. Phoenix: Me...? Grey: And that is why I've searched you out! You want to see her too, don't you!? Phoenix: (And so... that is how I ended up visiting Maya's hometown with the doctor...) June 19, 1:25 PMKurain Village Phoenix: (So this is Kurain Village; Maya's hometown.) ???: ... Phoenix: W-Why, hello there. ???: ... Phoenix: Hmm... What an odd little girl. ???: Hey! Wait up, Pearly!! Phoenix: (Hm? Someone else is coming this way...) ???: Niiiiiiiick! Phoenix: M-Maya. How are you...? It's good to see you again. Maya: Wow, I didn't think you'd really show up! Phoenix: It's not that big a deal. You made it sound like you were soooo far away. Maya: Well, maybe I exaggerated... just a little. Phoenix: It was only 2 hours by train. If I had known you were this close, I'd have visited more. Maya: No! You're not allowed. I already decided, you know. Until I become an adult, I have to work hard and be strong by myself... Phoenix: Oh... well... Anyway, congratulations. I'm glad to hear training is going well for you. Maya: Heh, heh... Examine Phone booth Phoenix: It's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. My cell phone doesn't get reception up here, so who knows. I may need it later. Bus shelter Phoenix: An old bus stop. It says \"Kurain Village\" on the sign post. The buses seem incredibly inconvenient since they only come 3 times a day. Giant rock Phoenix: A giant rock that seems to be reaching for the sky. Its origins are written on a beat-up, old sign. It looks like this giant rock is called the \"Kurain Boulder\". There's a really complex explanation written here, but long story short, it's a big stone for spirits to live in... Or something like that... Road and houses further Phoenix: Rustic, thatch-roofed houses where the other villagers live line the street. They're nowhere near as large or as nice as the manor in front of me. It's kind of odd that I don't see any of the other villagers walking around, though... Fey Manor Phoenix: The biggest, most elegant of the buildings I can see from here. This is Fey Manor; the place Maya calls home. It's easy to be overwhelmed by its presence... Talk Today's channeling Phoenix: Looks like you've finally become a full-fledged medium, taking on your first job. Maya: Yeah. I didn't think it would be this soon. Phoenix: But this case... Do you know the messy story behind it...? Maya: Ha ha ha, behold the power of the Maya Intelligence Network! Let's see. Fourteen people died because of malpractice on Dr. Grey's part, right? And to pin the blame on the nurse, he killed her in what appeared to be a car accident! Phoenix: Huh? Um, so what is this \"Maya Intelligence Network\" anyway...? Maya: The tabloids. Phoenix: That's what I thought. Maya: ... Ha ha ha. I'm just pulling your leg, Nick! What really happened is the exact opposite. I heard all about it from Dr. Grey. Phoenix: ... Maya: Oh, come on, Nick! I wouldn't take a crazed killer as a client! That's too scary, even for me. Phoenix: (Y-Yeah, I guess so.) Kurain Village Phoenix: So this is your hometown, huh, Maya? Maya: Yup! Kurain Village... But I've heard people call this place \"Medium Valley\", too. Phoenix: Interesting... So everyone that lives here is a spirit medium? Maya: Pretty much. Most of my ancestors were too, I think... Phoenix: (That's probably true since the Fey ability to communicate with the dead is so strong...) Maya: Actually, only the women of this village are mediums. Phoenix: So what do the men do? Maya: They usually work someplace outside the village. The girl earlier Phoenix: Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you about that girl I saw earlier. Do you know her? Maya: Oh, you mean Pearly? Phoenix: Pearly? Maya: Pearl Fey. She's my cousin. Isn't she adorable? Just like yours truly! Phoenix: Cousin... Wait, then that means... Is she also a...? Maya: Yup. She's a medium, too. Pearly's a real genius when it comes to channeling! Phoenix: Hmm, I see. I hope I didn't scare her when I tried to talk to her earlier. Maya: Nah, it's not you. My aunt drilled it into her head that \"if a suspicious-looking person tries to talk to you, run away\". Phoenix: S-Suspicious-looking...!? Maya: Well, you're not wearing training clothes, for starters... Phoenix: Of course not. Maya: Pearly is my aunt's most valued treasure, so she's not allowed to go outside of town. She doesn't know much about the world outside of Kurain Village. Phoenix: Aunt? Maya: Pearly's mother is my aunt, duh. Come on, Nick. Present Attorney's Badge Maya: Ah, it's good to see this tarnished badge again. Phoenix: What do you mean by \"tarnished\"...? Maya: Well, look. This badge is like every other. It's bound to lose its color and shine after years and years. But you know, polishing it up once in a while wouldn't be a bad idea. Maya Fey profile Maya: Ha ha ha. I'm warning you! I'm not the same weak Maya you knew a year ago, Nick! Phoenix: You seem to have a lot of faith in yourself. Maya: You'll see soon enough. I think you'll be totally shocked by how good my hamburgers are now! Phoenix: (Were you training to be a medium or a cook?) Turner Grey profile Maya: Hey, it's my client! Phoenix: \"Client,\" huh? You're really serious about your work, aren't you? Maya: I thought I'd say it once, just to try it out, like how you always say, \"My client.\" Any other evidence Maya: Hmm, nothing really comes to mind, Nick. Phoenix: Don't say that with such a big smile on your face. Maya: Ha ha. What can I say? I'm in a good mood today. Any other profile Phoenix: What do you think about this person? Maya: Hey, have I told you this one yet, Nick? We have a legend in this village. It goes like this. \"All the woman of the Fey clan are beauties.\" Well? Phoenix: ...And that's a legend now? After clearing all Talk options: Maya: Well, Nick, I've got to get going. It's about time for the channeling to start. Phoenix: Huh? Oh, yeah... Maya: I'm doing the channeling in my house, so come on in, OK? After I'm done, we can grill up some juicy burgers! Phoenix: Alright. Good luck, Maya. Maya: Thanks! Phoenix: (Well... At least she's still the same perky Maya.) June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Grey: Ah, Mr. Wright. I'm so glad you showed. Phoenix: Some nice weather we're having today. Aren't you happy? Grey: No, not at all. That stupid weather girl made the wrong call again. \"It will rain cats and dogs today!\" she said with a straight face. I can't believe they allow such misguided reports on the public airwaves! Phoenix: (Looks like talking about the weather with this guy is just asking for punishment...) Grey: ...But anyway, this is a splendid manor. Phoenix: (No argument there... It's hard to believe that this is Maya's house, though...) Grey: I was given a guidemap to this building. Here, Mr. Wright. I have a copy for you too. Guidemap added to the Court Record. Examine Door Phoenix: A door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. It looks like there is a strong lock on this door to top it off. Writing on top of the door Phoenix: Someone with a lot of skill wrote these four Chinese characters with a brush. Oh look, here's a translation: \"Once in a Lifetime.\" Its message is people should value their ghostly meetings as once in a lifetime chances. Blue board Phoenix: A piece of cloth with a ton of finely-written characters jammed onto it. Probably esoteric knowledge only mediums should know. ...Hmm, let's see... Here's one in English... It says... \"100 Ways to Save Money\". ... Being a medium sounds like a rough way of life... Door to the Winding Way Phoenix: This door leads out to the Winding Way. The weather outside looks really nice. Talk Today's channeling Phoenix: What are you going to do once the nurse's spirit has been called? Grey: Isn't it obvious? I'm going to have her write a signed confession. Phoenix: A signed confession? Grey: Yes, a confession. Pay attention! I'll have her write this: \"One year ago, on May 2nd, 14 patients died due to my negligence. And then, on May 24th, I fell asleep at the wheel and died in a car accident due to my further negligence. I'm sorry and I apologize for being negligent.\" That's what I'll have her write! With a confession, the rain falling on my soul can finally stop. Phoenix: O-Oh, I see... Maya Phoenix: So, how did you hear about Maya Fey...? Grey: I heard about her from an acquaintance; a girl studying the occult at the college. That girl introduced me to this village. This is the home of the Kurain School of Channeling. Phoenix: The home, huh...? Grey: And Ms. Maya is a daughter of the \"Master\", I hear. Phoenix: Master...? Grey: Anyway, do you see that door? That's the room where people and spirits meet. Ms. Maya's aunt is in there right now. Would you care to meet her...? Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Look, here's my attorney's badge. Grey: Are you trying to compete with me and my profession with that piece of scrap? Phoenix: ...Uh... Grey: I am a surgeon. Compared to you lawyers, I'm practically a saint! Yes, well, I don't exactly have any patients right now, but, and listen good! I'm not the one that made the mistake! Phoenix: (This doctor needs his head examined...) Guidemap (Fey Manor) Phoenix: Wow, this manor is really nice, don't you think? Grey: Do you honestly think this place is all that impressive? Don't make me laugh. Phoenix: Huh? Grey: This is the countryside. Land here is dirt cheap. I will have something much greater one day! I will build my own grand mansion! Did you hear me!? A grand MANSION! This manor will seem like nothing! Phoenix: (Uh, could you keep that shaking fist away from my face? Thanks...) Maya Fey profile Grey: She's still young, but one day, she'll bear a big responsibility. She'll be the Master, you know. The MASTER! Phoenix: (I guess there are \"Master\" mediums, too...) Morgan Fey profile Grey: That's Ms. Maya's aunt. Earlier, she made me eat some sort of traditional dessert the size of a tea saucer! Hmm, I wonder if Ms. Morgan ever performs channelings herself...? Any other profile Phoenix: What do you have to say about this person, Dr. Grey? Grey: ...This person... Hmm... Judging by their face... Phoenix: W-What is it? Grey: They have a weak stomach. Phoenix: R-Really... June 19Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: (Wow... It's such a strange atmosphere in here... These flickering lights... I guess they're candles...) ???: Good sir! Who might you be...? Phoenix: Aaah! I-I'm, uh, my name is Phoenix Wright... ???: Oh... You must be that good sir... Phoenix: (\"Good sir\"...? Is she talking about me?) ???: You are a lawyer, are you not, good sir? I have heard much about you from Mystic Maya. Phoenix: Is that so? (\"Mystic\" Maya...?) ???: I am Mystic Maya's aunt, Morgan Fey. Phoenix: N-Nice to meet you. Morgan: Ah, I had wanted to speak with you about a certain incident, good sir. It would seem that perhaps you ask too much of Mystic Maya in performing your duties. Most unbecoming, I'm afraid. Phoenix: Huh? Morgan: Don't tell me you have already forgotten? That was it not for Mystic Maya and her assistance, you would surely not have won... Phoenix: (First a girl that runs away, and now an old lady who says I stink at doing my job... When did I become the poster boy for \"How Not to Make a First Impression\"...?) Morgan: The past is the past though. Let us speak of the present now. Phoenix: ...Ah, thank you... Examine Door Phoenix: The Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. There is a giant iron lock where the handle is. It feels like a curtain that separates the normal world from the spirit one. Floor panels on left Phoenix: This is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air. Altar Phoenix: I guess this is an altar. Whatever it is, it feels very important. (Changed from [I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important.] in the original release) A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement. Morgan: Good sir! I wonder if you would please not touch the sacred objects. Those objects are being offered to the spirits. If you were to touch them, good sir, they would become cursed. Yes, cursed. Phoenix: (She really didn't have to talk down to me. I'm not that much of an idiot...) Folding screen Phoenix: This folding screen is really showing its age. All of its edges are a bit tattered. The lettering is fading too. I think I recognize a few of the characters on here... ...Ku ...ra ...in... I'm pretty sure that's what it says... Maybe I'll ask Maya about it later... Space behind folding screen Phoenix: There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. Talk Maya Phoenix: So why do you add \"Mystic\" to Maya's name. Isn't that a little... strange? Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Yes! Morgan: How dare you be so rude and disrespectful towards Mystic Maya! Phoenix: I-I'm sorry. Morgan: She must be addressed by her proper title, good sir. You must call her \"Mystic Maya\"! Phoenix: Um, uh... So, about Mystic Maya... Uh... Morgan: It is the blood. Phoenix: Excuse me? \"Blood\"? Morgan: Mystic Maya carries the blood of the Master. In actuality, she is the only one remaining. Phoenix: (Only one remaining...? What's that supposed to mean?) Morgan: Mystic Maya is the last of the rightful heirs of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: OK... Then... where do you stand...? Morgan: That is a little more complicated... Although a woman of the Fey family, I am merely a member of the branch family. Phoenix: ...Branch family? What's that? Morgan: It is as it sounds. For a member of the branch family, no matter her spiritual power, she can never become the Master of the Kurain School. Phoenix: So... how strong are you...? Morgan: ... It is a shame, however I will admit. I can not even begin to compare the lowliness of my power to the Master's. Phoenix: (So that's how it is...) Today's channeling Phoenix: So today's channeling will be her first? Morgan: Yes, good sir. Because the spirit of a person who dies in a traffic accident is usually very strong, it is usually easier to call that person to our world. Phoenix: (\"Traffic accident\" indeed.) Morgan: The channeling will take place here, in this Channeling Chamber, good sir. As you can see, I am in the process of preparing. Channeling Chamber Phoenix: So... this room is the... Channeling Chamber...? Morgan: The place where a spirit medium speaks with those who have departed. Phoenix: I don't suppose you'd mind if we observed the session... Morgan: Do not even think of such nonsense! Only the medium and the client may enter here. Phoenix: O-Oh. Morgan: The secrets of the Kurain Techniques can not be seen by just anybody. Phoenix: (That never stopped Maya from doing it in front of me before...) Morgan: It is also for your safety, good sir, if something were to go wrong. That is why, while channeling is being performed, that heavy door is securely locked... Phoenix: Oh, that's what the lock is for... Present Maya Fey profile Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Y-Yes! Morgan: When did you... take a hidden picture of Mystic Maya!? Phoenix: Wh-Wh-What!? Wait... It's not like that at all! Morgan: It is unforgivable! Phoenix: Ow-ow-ow! (Why did she slap me?) Turner Grey profile Phoenix: About this person... Morgan: Oh! It is that man, is it not? A man who wishes to borrow a departed spirit's power to hide the lack of his own. What an insignificant man. Phoenix: Insignificant...? Morgan: That would mean you are that man's insignificant little friend, dear sir. Phoenix: (Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?) Anything else Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Ack! Morgan: We would like to begin the channeling at 3 o'clock. If you don't mind, good sir, would you mind allowing me to make preparations? Phoenix: Uh, um, sure... go ahead... (She's a Fey alright! Just as odd as the rest.) After clearing all Talk options: Morgan: ... Oh, yes. I wonder if you have yet to meet Pearl, good sir. Phoenix: Pearl? Morgan: She is an adorable, angelic young girl. Phoenix: Oh, that odd... Morgan: She is my daughter. Now then, what was it you were about to say...? Phoenix: Wh-What a cute daughter you have... Ahaha... Morgan: A pure heart that knows not of the evils in this world is a powerful thing, good sir. Please refrain from affiliating with her, I request. Phoenix: (Well, it's not like I had the chance to anyway...) Morgan: I must insist and stress that you not let it occur. Phoenix: Okay, okay, I get it! June 19Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Wow. This garden is really breath-taking. Someone put a lot of love into it. What is that over there...? ...Is that an incinerator? It looks a little out of place in a garden like this...) Examine Garden Phoenix: A splendid garden with a small lamp and traditional decorations. It's a bit small to walk around in... Although, that incinerator piques my curiosity... Incinerator Phoenix: It's a small incinerator. I don't think garbage trucks come all the way out here to a little village like this. So every family has to burn their own trash. Side room Phoenix: It looks like there's a room over there, too. A peaceful feeling is emanating from it. Urn Phoenix: It's a really old urn. The ashes of a person long dead are inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on. June 19Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: (So this is... the Side Room. Looks like it's more of a break room. There is bedding spread out on the floor. It looks like someone's sleeping in one. I shouldn't disturb them...) Examine Wooden bear sculpture Phoenix: It's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. \"Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling\" What the!? It's a souvenir. So does this mean it's easy to spot bears here... And for them to spot you...? *gulp* Alcove Phoenix: It's a small alcove. I have no idea what it's supposed to mean or symbolize. If I had one of these in the office, it would end up as storage space. But here, it's decorated with some pretty flowers and a beautiful hanging scroll. Sliding door Phoenix: This is the first time I've seen a sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard. Bed on right Phoenix: There's bedding spread out on the floor. Is that someone sleeping in one over there? She's probably an exhausted medium taking a break and catching some z's. If I wake her up, she might be grumpy and throw a spell on me. It's probably a good idea to not disturb her sleep... Winding Way (after visiting Side Room and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber) ???: Hey! You! Hold on, now! This gal's got a few questions to ask! Phoenix: (Hmm... I'm sure I've heard that southern accent somewhere before...) ???: Oh, well I'll be! It's Mr. Phoenix Wright! How ya been!? Haven't seen you in, what, a year!? Phoenix: Um... You... are... uh... Lotta Hair Phoenix: Um, Lotta Hair, was it? ???: L-L-Lotta Who!? Wait, you best not be making fun of my hair, now! Phoenix: Ah, no, um, I wasn't \"making fun\"... I was \"complimenting\" you on your fine hair... ???: Hmph, I dare say yer one heartless man, Mr. Wright. It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty. But looks like you already forgot that. Phoenix: Hold up... you were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak... ???: Minor detail. Stop being so uptight; lettin' little things get in the way. The name's Hart. Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it! Phoenix: Oh yeah! That's it! Lotta: Now listen here. I'm here to take some pictures today. Gonna get myself a real scoop. Phoenix: Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean. Lotta: You betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous \"paranormal photographer\"!? Leads to: \"Oh, that's right!\" Lotta Hart Phoenix: You're Lotta Hart, right...? Lotta: Bingo! I'm the one and only \"paranormal photographer\", Lotta Hart! Phoenix: Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean. Lotta: Of course! And today, I'm gonna get myself a real scoop! You wait and see! Leads to: \"Oh, that's right!\" Who are you again? Phoenix: Sorry, but who are you again? ???: Oh Lawdy! I've met some cold men in my days, but you... You're in an icebox of yer own! Phoenix: Come on, am I really that bad...? ???: Put yer noggin to some use! You've gotta remember who I am! It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty. Phoenix: Ah! You're the one from that trial! ???: See, I knew you could remember if you tried! Phoenix: You were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak... ???: Why don't we let bygones be bygones, now. It's yesterday's news, right? Name's Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it, ya hear!? Phoenix: Um... So what brings you here today? Lotta: Hah! You should already know! I'm here for the big scoop! I can feel it! Phoenix: Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean. Lotta: You betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous \"paranormal photographer\"!? Leads to: \"Oh, that's right!\" Lotta: Oh, that's right! This ain't no time to be wastin' time! The channeling's about to get started! Phoenix: Is it that time already!? Lotta: We all should hurry up and get to the Meditation Room. ...What are you waiting around for!? Come on! Phoenix: (Lotta Hart, huh? I've been judging her harshly because of that case, but, I guess looking back, we had some good times, too...) June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Morgan: We will now begin the channeling. Mystic Maya and honored guest, please proceed into the Channeling Chamber. Grey: With this, I can finally swat all those pesky flies, once and for all! You hear me!? They won't be able to say a single bad thing about me after this! You would love to hear them apologize, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Me!? Oh, uh, yeah, I sure would. Morgan: Mystic Maya, do you have the Channeling Chamber key? Maya: Yup, right here. Morgan: That is most satisfactory. That key is one-of-a-kind, so please take care of it well. Maya: It'll be fine, Aunt Morgan. I won't lose it, trust me! OK, Dr. Grey. Let's get started. Grey: Finally! Let's go! *click* Morgan: Now let us wait patiently out here for them. Please have some lovely bitter green tea and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts... Lotta: Hold on, now, granny! Morgan: ...Granny? Lotta: How come we ain't allowed in that room!? Morgan: Dear madam, you have an \"impressive\" grasp of English. From where did you learn it? Lotta: What!? I'm from the heart of the heartland! Morgan: Is that so? Then I humbly request that you return to this \"Heart of the Heartland\". Lotta: Wh-What are ya...? Morgan: This is Kurain Village. If you can not follow our traditions and rules, we request that you leave! Lotta: ...! ... Sorry. Phoenix: (Wow. She shut Lotta up! Now THAT's impressive!) Morgan: Now then, let us wait. *BANG* Lotta: Hey now! Wh-What was that just now!? Phoenix: (It came from inside the Channeling Chamber...) *BANG* Lotta: Hey! Th-That's a gunshot! Morgan: E-Excuse me!? Lotta: I've heard that sound before. It's a gunshot! I'd bet my afro on it! Phoenix: (M-Maya! Maya's in there!) Break into the Chamber Lotta: Well, Mister Lawyer! What's the plan!? Phoenix: What else!? We're going to break in! Lotta: What!? But... But there's only one key and that kid's got it. Phoenix: We're going to have to break the door. Is that alright, Ms. Fey? Morgan: Well, yes... But there is one matter... That is... Phoenix: Don't try to stop me! You can send the repair bill to the Wright & Co. Law Offices later! Leads to: \"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\" Ask Morgan what to do Phoenix: Ms. Fey! What should we do!? Lotta: Yellow-bellied chicken liver! What are ya waiting for!? Kick it down already! Phoenix: But... The key... Morgan: That key is one-of-a-kind. In this world, there is only that one. Even I am powerless to open that door. Phoenix: (Hmm, there is really no other way...) Alright. Stand aside! I'm going to break the door down! Morgan: W-Wait! Please! That sort of recklessness... Leads to: \"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\" Lotta: Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man! *SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!* Phoenix: D-Dr. Grey!! *klik* ???: ...I... ...I was... murdered... Phoenix: M-Maya? ???: That man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him... Phoenix: Wh-What!? *klik* Phoenix: Lotta! At a time like this!? Lotta: Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!? Step away from there! Morgan: Please leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police! Phoenix: But, but... Morgan: Hurry! Before there are more victims here! Lotta: Hey, let's go, City Boy! Leave this to the granny! June 19Kurain Village Phoenix: (My cell phone doesn't get reception way out here... So I ended up using the phone booth to call the police...) Lotta: And...? Phoenix: They're on their way. Lotta: That's good. Lawdy, I saw a genuine \"mysterious phenomenon\"... Phoenix: (She seems really on edge because of all this... Not that I blame her... I'm scared to death by what's going on...) Talk What you witnessed Lotta: Hey, Mister. That gal... Maya. She wasn't the one that pulled the trigger, was she...? Phoenix: (Oh, yeah... Lotta doesn't know that when Maya is channeling, her whole physical appearance changes.) Lotta: Then again... Weren't there only the two of 'em in there? I reckon she musta done it then... Dr. Grey Phoenix: Lotta, what do you know about Dr. Grey? Lotta: Not much, but I did some digging... That's one gent with a bad reputation. Phoenix: Really? Lotta: I hear he's good at surgery and stuff, but his personality stinks like wet sheep. Phoenix: (I sort of got the same impression myself...) Lotta: He's real controllin'. Soon as his nurse or patients don't do what he says, he starts a-hollerin'. Musta been real rough to work for him. Present Anything Lotta: Hey, they'll be here soon, right? The police, I mean. I reckon you should be gettin' back to the crime scene, now. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess so...) June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Morgan: Ah, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Ms. Fey! How's, um... Mystic... Maya? Morgan: She has returned to \"this world\". The Spirit Severing Technique was successful. Phoenix: Let me see her, please! Morgan: She is still unconscious. I humbly request that you wait outside for her recovery. Phoenix: (Guess I just have to wait... *sigh*) Gumshoe: The police are here! Sorry to keep you waiting! Huh? ...You again!? Phoenix: What are you doing all the way out here, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: It's actually kinda funny. I was in the area for a business trip, pal. Well, time to check out the crime scene. I'll have to question everyone here later on, so just sit tight, alright? Phoenix: (Why is he grinning at me...?) Morgan: Shall I show you to the scene of the crime, Detective Gymshoe? Gumshoe: Um... My name isn't Gymshoe... Phoenix: (The two of them went into the Channeling Chamber... I guess all I can do for now is see what everyone else has to say...) June 19Kurain Village Lotta: ... Phoenix: (She's probably scared out of her wits after having a murder take place right near her.) Lotta? Lotta: GAWDDON'TLETITBEMENEXT! Phoenix: Eek! Don't scare me like that! Lotta: What do you mean!? Yer the one scaring me! If I weren't so tough, you'd have another dead body on yer hands -- mine! Talk Any ideas Leads to: \"Did you see or notice anything that stuck out at you?\" Present Maya Fey profile Lotta: Must be an awful thing to see each other again and have this happen. Never woulda guessed that gal would end up being a murderer. Phoenix: That wasn't Maya! She was being controlled by a spirit... Lotta: Come on, now, City Boy. Ya really think the cops'll believe that? Turner Grey profile Lotta: Hey, it's that Dr. Grey guy. Pity what happened to him. Pretty scary what ghouls and ghosts can do to a man, huh? Gawd rest his poor soul. Phoenix: (Hmm... Since when was Lotta so religious...?) Morgan Fey profile Lotta: That old lady sure can be forceful. She scared me back there. ...Well, only a little, now, ya hear? Dick Gumshoe profile Lotta: I swear I've seen his face before. Maybe during that last case... Whenever something happens, this detective guy is always there. I wonder if he's the real baddie behind everything? Phoenix: (Somehow, I highly doubt it...) Anything else Lotta: Nope. Don't know nothin' about that. Things that don't catch my eye, don't catch my interest. Phoenix: (And she calls herself a journalist??) Phoenix: Did you see or notice anything that stuck out at you? Lotta: Nah... Well, maybe one thing... Phoenix: What is it!? Lotta: Turns out my poor stomach's not good at handlin' this kind of thing. Phoenix: Huh-what? Lotta: Curses and ghosts and stuff comin' back to get ya... This is just too much, I say. Phoenix: What is too much? Lotta: Being an occult photographer. That's some scary stuff, so I think I'm gonna try being a celebrity photographer, now. Phoenix: Going after photos more within your reach from now on? More glamour, less gore? Lotta: ... Phoenix: What's up? Lotta: Oh, yeah! Phoenix: Wh-What is it? Lotta: I took some hot pictures earlier! Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: Remember!? I took some pictures at the murder scene inside! Phoenix: (Ack! She did! Two even!) Lotta: \"The Séance Murder\"... I sure like the ring of that. It'll be a sensational story! Phoenix: L-Lotta! Lotta: Sorry, but my journalistic sense is burnin' inside me! Hate to cut and run, but I'm headin' back in! Gotta beat those cops to the scoop of the century! UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhahahahahahahahahahaha... ... Phoenix: (I don't know who's scarier... Lotta or the spirits... And why does it feel like we've been through this before...?) June 19Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: (The police are busily running here and there, and I don't see Maya anywhere...) Gumshoe: H-Hey, you! Don't touch anything! Phoenix: Look, I really need to ask you some questions! Gumshoe: Umm... Don't look at me like I'm some sort of uncaring jerk... Tell you what, pal. I'll let you ask me a few questions, alright? Examine Anywhere Gumshoe: Hey, pal! No touching without my permission! Phoenix: I'm just looking at it. Gumshoe: Hey, I can't be too careful if a kid like her can be a murder suspect, now can I? Phoenix: (I guess if I want to search this room, I'm going to have to come back later...) Talk Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: I hate to break this to you, pal, but... with the way things look now, that girl's the only one who could've done it. Phoenix: (Yeah. Only Maya and the victim were inside this room, after all...) But Maya is... Gumshoe: You can ask more about her later, pal. Right now, I've got a job to do and that's collecting evidence. Phoenix: (Detective Gumshoe looks like a real professional. And yet, something about his expression still looks the same...) Cause of death Phoenix: So... Dr. Grey was shot with a gun, huh? Gumshoe: He was shot in the forehead. But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: But he was also stabbed in the chest with a knife. Phoenix: (...A knife?) Gumshoe: Basically, the vic was first stabbed, then he was shot. (Changed from [After being stabbed, the final blow was a shot from a gun.] in the original release) Present Anything Gumshoe: Ah, I'm really busy right now. I can take a look at it later, alright, pal? Phoenix: (He didn't even take a glance at it...) June 19Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: (Hmm, I'm pretty sure there was someone sleeping here earlier...) ???: Like, how can I help you? Phoenix: Ack! Ah, I'm, uh... That is... I... ???: Um, like, so isn't it about time to start? Phoenix: Huh? Time to start what? ???: You know, like, the channeling! Phoenix: Channeling...? Oh, oh, oh, oh!! No, actually, the situation has kind of changed... ???: Huh? Like, what do you mean? Phoenix: Please stay calm, but... there has been a murder! (Changed from [Please stay calm, but... a murder has taken place!] in the original release) ???: ... Um, so, like... A murder is that thing where, like, one person kills another, right? Phoenix: Yes! A person has killed another person! ???: Oh, that's... Uh... What are the words I'm looking for...? It's like... ...like totally a bummer. Phoenix: ...Yeah... (After all that effort, that's all she had to say?) ???: Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to, like, introduce myself. Ini: My name is Ini Miney. Um... At the college, I'm researching and studying \"parapsychology\". Phoenix: \"Parapsychology\"? Ini: That's right. Um... I think people, like, usually call it, \"occult studies\" or something. Like supernatural phenomenon, ESP and psychic powers. That sort of stuff. Phoenix: (That's pretty out there...) I'm Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. Examine Bed on right Phoenix: You left the blanket a mess. Are you going to fold it? Ini: Like I had a really good nap, and, like... I was thinking of leaving it like this, so, like, it's all set for tonight. Talk Ini Miney Phoenix: So what brings you here today? Ini: Um, like, so... I was the one who told Dr. Grey about this place. He asked me, like, \"Do you know of a good spirit medium?\" Phoenix: (Hmm, Dr. Grey did say something about being introduced to this place.) Ini: Cause, like, talking to dead people and, like, multiple personalities are my thing... Phoenix: I see... Then why were you taking a nap here? Ini: Like... I wasn't feeling good. Phoenix: Huh? Ini: I'm, like, allergic to sesame seeds. They, like, must've put some in the food they served for lunch. Phoenix: Oh, that doesn't sound fun. Ini: So I, like, felt sick, and came in here to, like, sleep. I totally feel, like, I've wasted my time 'cause I, like, slept a long time. What happened Phoenix: So you were sleeping here the entire time? Ini: Yeah. Ever since lunch... Phoenix: So you don't know anything about the murder that took place? Ini: Like, what? Oh, that! I, like, totally know nothing. So who was, like, you know, killed...? Phoenix: The surgeon that requested the channeling, Dr. Grey. Ini: ... The victim (appears after \"Ini Miney\" and \"What happened\") Phoenix: You and Dr. Grey knew each other, right? Ini: ...! I don't know any Dr. Grey! Phoenix: Oh really...? Then what was all that talk about him earlier? (Changed from [That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...] in the original release) Ini: Huh!? ...Well, uh... Like, a long, long time ago... I was, like, a patient, yeah. Phoenix: (She sounds like she's trying to hide something...) Present Maya Fey profile Ini: Oh, hey! That's, like, Maya Fey, right? She's, like, totally waaaay famous! Like, well, for people like us, like, you know? Phoenix: (\"Waaaay famous\"? Maya?) Ini: I mean, like, she's, like, the daughter of the Master, right? Phoenix: (Hmm... Well, at least she remembers some things.) Ini Miney profile Ini: Um... This face... Like, I think I've seen it somewhere before... Phoenix: What!? ...Y-You're joking, right? Ini: Ha ha, like, of course I am, silly! Phoenix: (Oh, thank goodness...) Any other evidence Ini: Like, I'm really sorry, but I'm not all that smart... so I don't, like, get it. Phoenix: (Hmm. Why does it feel like she's just putting on an act?) Any other profile Ini: I'm, like, totally bad at remembering people's names. Phoenix: Oh? Ini: But I, like, remember seeing that face somewhere before, like, I think... Phoenix: Well, thanks for trying. (I didn't think it was possible for someone to be this much of an airhead...) June 19Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (There's no one here... as usual.) Ack! ...H-Hey... How are you? Pearl: ... Phoenix: You're Pearl, right? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Hmm. Silent as ever... ...? What's that she's got in her hand? I've seen it somewhere before...) Talk Any option Phoenix: Um... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: (...What is it!? Is it my hair? Is it too spiky? Not spiky enough!?) Present Anything Phoenix: Um... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: (...What is it!? Is it my hair? Is it too spiky? Not spiky enough!?) After clearing \"Any ideas\" Talk option in Kurain Village and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber and Fey Manor - Side Room: June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Morgan: Oh, dear madam... You have such impeccable timing. Ini: Like, what's all the buzz? Gumshoe: Ahem. Alright everyone, listen up! You too, pal! I'm going to give you all a brief update! Right now, it looks like the investigation's not going to be done until real late... Morgan: That is a terrible shame. I propose that everyone sleep here under the roof of the Fey Manor tonight. Phoenix: (What a mess. I can't believe how crazy this day turned out... Maya was arrested and taken away by the police. And I don't see myself getting any sleep tonight...) June 20, 8:02 AMFey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: (*yawn* Uuugh... Morning... I guess I must have nodded off at some point... I hope Maya's OK. I should hurry and get to the Detention Center, ASAP!) June 20, 10:34 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: N... Nick! Nick! I...! Phoenix: Maya! Maya: What am I going to do!? I never imagined it would turn out like this! Phoenix: Calm down, Maya! Take deep breaths. (Come to think of it, the first time I met her... It all started right here, in this detention center...) Maya: I finally... I finally get to see you again, and... Phoenix: It's not your fault. You didn't do it. Maya: No, I... I did it... I killed that person. Phoenix: But that wasn't you. Maya: It doesn't matter. It might as well have been me. I was too weak... and I... I couldn't control the spirit's power, so... Phoenix: (I don't want to bring up the case quite yet, but...) Maya: ...You don't have to be nice to me. I understand. Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. I wonder if he's bored. Not that I can tell since he never looks over this way. Talk Channeling Phoenix: So you're the Master or something of the Kurain School of Channeling...? Maya: Actually, my mother is for now. But since that title is passed from mother to daughter, I guess I will be someday... Phoenix: But many people think that channeling isn't real, that it's all just an act. Maya: You believe in us, don't you? Phoenix: Yeah... because I've seen it with my own eyes. (When Maya's channeling a spirit... not only her voice, but her whole physical appearance changes. It's a supernatural phenomenon that occurs every time. It happened this time, too... Dr. Grey said that he wanted to call the nurse, so... Maya's body must have taken on that nurse's appearance...) What happened Phoenix: What exactly happened in the Channeling Chamber? Maya: ... I went into that room with Dr. Grey, locked the door... and sat down across from him. Phoenix: OK... Maya: We closed our eyes...and I began the channeling. Phoenix: (This is sounding kind of creepy... like the beginning of a scary story...) Maya: And that's the last thing I remember... Phoenix: What? Maya: After a spirit comes into my body, I lose my self, my consciousness. Phoenix: Then, you don't remember a single thing? Maya: When I came to, I was being held in my aunt's arms. And there was blood... all over my clothes. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Maya: Oh! But... I do remember having a dream. Phoenix: A dream...? \"Dream\" (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: What kind of dream did you have while you were channeling...? Maya: Um... I can't remember it all that well, but... I was dead and buried in the ground. I couldn't move... and it was unbearable... Really suffocating... ...It went something like that. Phoenix: I... I see... (I have no idea what to say to that...) Maya: There was a really familiar smell too... Phoenix: Under the ground? Maya: Yeah, I can't quite place it, but I know I've smelled that same scent before... Present Maya Fey profile Maya: I... I can't face myself... Phoenix: (I should've known better...) Turner Grey profile Maya: !! T-The... That's the guy I k-killed... Phoenix: Ack! I'm sorry! (Why did I pull this picture out!?) Pearl Fey profile Maya: Pearly... She definitely has more than me... Phoenix: Huh? What are you talking about? Maya: Who I think the next Master should be... I mean, she's got more spiritual power than me, and she really works hard at her training... Phoenix: (Talk about bringing the mood down even further... *sigh*) Morgan Fey profile Maya: I... I can't face my aunt right now... Not now... that this has happened... Phoenix: It's alright, Maya. I'm sure she understands. She's on our side, after all. Maya: Yeah, I know... But still... Lotta Hart profile Maya: That's Lotta Hart... right? Phoenix: That girl is still after the next sensational photo. Maya: Ha ha. I guess some things never change. Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: I felt terrible during the questioning session... I mean, Gumshoe kept looking at me... with these really sad eyes... ... Any other evidence Maya: Sorry, Nick, but there's nothing really special about it. Any other profile Phoenix: So... what do you think about this person...? Maya: ...? Phoenix: (I guess I can't expect her to know anything about this person.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... (...I guess this is about all the information I'm going to gather for today...) I'll be back later, Maya. In the meantime, please make sure you prepare it, OK? Maya: Huh? \"It\"? What is \"it\"? Phoenix: The document requesting me to be your attorney, of course. Maya: ...! But... Phoenix: What's wrong? Maya: Are you sure? I mean, I'm guilty! I'm a murderer! Phoenix: No one's decided that yet. Maya: But I did! I killed that person... with these... two hands...! Phoenix: That's enough, Maya. Maya: It's hopeless! If you defend me, you'll lose, I'm sure... Phoenix: Stop it! Maya: ... ...Help me... Nick, help me... I'm scared... Phoenix: Don't worry, I will. When is the trial? Maya: It sounds like tomorrow. Phoenix: (As usual, zero prep time...) Alright. I'm going now. Maya: Wait. Phoenix: ...? Maya: This jewel... This is called a Magatama. It's a magical charm and it's always protected me. Give this to Pearly... And I'm sure she'll lend you her spiritual powers. Magatama received from Maya. Present Maya's Magatama Maya: Make sure you show that to Pearly, OK, Nick? I'm sure she'll be a big help to you. June 20Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Phew. It feels like I've been gone forever. But it's only been one day... (Oh, that's right!) Where's that newspaper Dr. Grey brought the other day...? ...Ah, here it is. Right on top of my desk. (This is the only thing he left behind that's going to be of any help...) Newspaper Clipping 1 added to the Court Record. Examine Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Until recently, it had been a normal, business-class hotel. Houseplant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. It's a memento of my boss, Mia... who passed away. The rest of the room may be in shambles, but I always manage to care for this little fella. Poster Phoenix: A poster of the TV action hero, the Steel Samurai. Maya stuck it up here right before she left. I wouldn't say that the Steel Samurai and an attorney's office are a good match, but Maya threatened to curse me with some magic spell... so I guess it can stay. Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long, a layer of dust has started to form. One of these days, I should try to build up the courage to read one... Maybe. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I keep it neat for those rare occasions when I actually have a client in the office. After visiting Wright & Co. Law Offices or Kurain Village: June 20Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (Maya must still be in questioning... I hope the detectives are taking it easy on her, but... these kinds of cases aren't taken lightly. I guess I'll come back later.) June 20Kurain Village Phoenix: (I have to save Maya, no matter what! It's her life on the line! What in the world happened in that room yesterday?) June 20Fey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: (The Meditation Room nurtures all mediums young and old. Even mediums in training, I'd wager. But it's pretty deserted today... ...probably because of the murder yesterday...) June 20Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today... I should take this chance and thoroughly check this room. If I'm lucky, I might uncover a clue or two... Morgan: Oh, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Good morning. Morgan: I am on my way to go meet Mystic Maya, and I thought to bring her some items to make her feel more at home. Namely, tea so bitter you lose your tongue and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts. Phoenix: I'm sure Maya will be very grateful... Morgan: That's \"Mystic Maya\", good sir! Phoenix: (Urk. She is one scary lady.) Morgan: Oh, dear, sweet Mystic Maya... Pearl wept constantly for you last night, as did I. Phoenix: (I know it's important for me to search the site, but I should ask her some questions too, while I have the chance...) Examine (left side) Door Phoenix: The Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. The lock on it is broken, because, well... I broke it. It doesn't seem possible, but I managed to break it pretty badly. When we want to do something bad enough, people can do the most amazing things. Floor panels on left Phoenix: This is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air. No matter what I do, my eyes keep getting drawn to the pool of blood in the center here. Altar Phoenix: I guess this is an altar. Whatever it is, it feels very important. (Changed from [I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important.] in the original release) A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement. I'd guess they're used during the channeling... Folding screen Phoenix: It's a beautiful and expensive folding screen. It also looks quite old. There seems to be some sort of sacred text written on it, but I can't read it. ... ! Th-This is... It's a hole! Could this have been made by a bullet? Folding Screen added to the Court Record. Space behind folding screen Phoenix: There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. I hope no one is hiding back there. Talk What happened Phoenix: I would like to ask you a few questions about what happened yesterday. Morgan: Do you mean that awful tragedy? ???: That man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him... Phoenix: M-Maya? Step away from there! Morgan: Please leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police! Phoenix: What happened here in this room after I left? Morgan: Well... First, I struck Mystic Maya on the head. Phoenix: To make her go unconscious, correct? Morgan: That is correct. Next, I performed the Spirit Severing Technique. Phoenix: \"Spirit Severing Technique\"? Morgan: The spirit of that nurse was inside of Mystic Maya's body. I used the technique to send the nurse's spirit back to the other world. Phoenix: (I wonder if this kind of testimony is even admissible in a court of law...) Channeling Chamber Phoenix: By the way, what is this room exactly...? Morgan: The Channeling Chamber? This room was created for the sole purpose of preventing such a tragedy as yesterday. Phoenix: What do you mean? Morgan: Sometimes, when an inexperienced medium calls an especially strong spirit, that spirit may become violent and revolt, as you witnessed yesterday. Phoenix: Revolt? But how? Morgan: When a spirit enters a medium's body, she loses her will and her self steps aside. To put it another way, the spirit is borrowing the medium's body, good sir. Phoenix: But isn't that extremely dangerous? Morgan: An experienced medium has little problem controlling a spirit. Phoenix: But Maya... I mean, Mystic Maya... That was her first channeling... Morgan: And that was why I insisted on locking the door. However, I never thought that would be calling danger upon the client himself... I am grateful that one of our heirlooms was not damaged in this horrible incident. Phoenix: And that would be...? (Changed from [And that is...?] in the original release) Morgan: That folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings. (Changed from [It is that folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings.] in the original release) Along with the Kurain Sacred Urn, they are this village's most treasured possessions. If I ever found out that something had happened to either one... Oh, the inhumanity... Phoenix: (Odd for her to be worrying about the folding screen at a time like this... I guess this isn't just some dilapidated old screen after all...) Pearl Phoenix: So... How is Pearl today...? Morgan: Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Morgan: In this world, Pearl is my most treasured possession. When compared to even Mystic Maya, Pearl has the spiritual power to become a Master. Phoenix: Th-That's very impressive. Morgan: Until now, the women of the branch family have thought themselves to be inferior. .. But. Pearl is different! Her spiritual strength is so great; even greater than some of the main family! Yes, Pearl is a channeling prodigy and is the pride of the branch family! Phoenix: (Wow... She's really fired up now...) Morgan: In any case... Our world is so different from yours, perhaps it is best for you to quit, good sir. Phoenix: \"Quit\"? Quit what? Present Maya's Magatama Morgan: ...Oh my! Phoenix: Wh-What is it? Morgan: That... That is Mystic Maya's Magatama. Why would you have this in your possession!? Phoenix: I-I'm sorry! Morgan: Return it to Mystic Maya at once! Phoenix: Y-Yes, madam! (Why did I feel like I was being scolded by my own mother just now...?) Folding Screen Morgan: Ah, so even someone such as yourself can take interest in something like this. This is the Kurain Channeling Technique Sacred Writings. There are 6 panels in all. Phoenix: I see... But that's not what caught my eye. You see this hole here...? Morgan: It is an old screen, you see. It is only logical that perhaps a bug or worm of some sort is the culprit. Phoenix: (Even though this looks nothing like the eating patterns of any bug I know...) Maya Fey profile Morgan: I can hardly believe Mystic Maya has become like this. Directly influenced by the likes of you, and becoming caught up in a situation such as this... Phoenix: I'm sorry... (...Hey, hold on! How is all this MY fault!?) Morgan: I told her so many times, as I have also told Pearl, \"Do not associate with strange old men you don't know\". Phoenix: (Well, that shouldn't apply to me then, especially since I'm hardly an \"old man\" yet!!) Turner Grey profile Morgan: That doctor was one of those people. Those who intend harm upon the spirits receive harm in return; it's karma at work. It seems that he was the one to take the nurse's life, wouldn't you agree? Phoenix: (I guess that's possible...) Pearl Fey profile Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Y...Yes? Morgan: When did you take this picture!? This is one of those... what are they called...? Those... \"hidden camera\" pictures! Phoenix: N-No!! It's not one of those at all!! Morgan: Such an unforgivable offense! You will hand it over to me! Phoenix: N-No! I won't! (If I ever want to talk about Pearl again, I should be much more careful...) Morgan Fey profile Morgan: It shows the same face as the one I see in the mirror every day. Phoenix: And? Anything else? Morgan: No. That is all. Phoenix: (Why in the world did I bother to show this to her!?) Any other evidence Morgan: I will be leaving shortly to meet with Mystic Maya. I simply do not have the time to look at such trivial matters. Any other profile Morgan: We usually do not welcome strangers into our village as they disturb the aura here. Especially people like you, good sir. Phoenix: H-Hey, what do you mean, \"especially people like me?\" Morgan: You selfishly make Mystic Maya help you with your work... You should be thankful I have not taken your life for such a disrespectful act. Phoenix: Y-Yes, madam... Morgan: And even more importantly, remember that if anything were to happen to Pearl... Phoenix: (What is that supposed to mean!?) After clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen: Morgan: Well, then, I do believe it is time for me to take my leave. Phoenix: Alright. Please tell Maya I said hi. Morgan: What was that!? Phoenix: Uh, I mean, Mystic Maya. Morgan: I will tell her. Phoenix: (...*sigh*) June 20Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Little Pearl isn't here today... Maybe she's at school?) June 20Fey ManorSide Room Ini: Oh, hey! Like, you're that guy from yesterday... The, uh, dentist guy... Phoenix: No, no, I'm a lawyer. Ini: That's right! Um... Mr. Smith, Esquire. Phoenix: ...That's \"Wright\". Wait, I mean, you're wrong. My name is \"Wright\". Ini: \"Smith\", \"Wright\"... Well, I got, like, three letters, at least. Phoenix: (I don't think she gets the point...) Anyway, why are you here? Ini: So, like, I study this thing called \"parapsychology\" at this college and... Phoenix: Um, you told me about that yesterday. The sesame allergy, too. What I'd really like to know is why you're still here today? Ini: Oh! So, like, that's what you meant! Like, you shoulda been more, like, clear about it! Phoenix: S-Sorry. My bad. Ini: No, it's OK. Like, it's really... Phoenix: ... Ini: ...? Phoenix: ...That's it? Why'd you stop mid-sentence!? Ini: Did I? ...So, like... what was I talking about again...? Phoenix: ... (If Lotta ever wanted another \"genuine mysterious phenomenon\", it's right here.) Examine Wooden bear sculpture Phoenix: It's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. \"Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling\" What the!? It's a souvenir. Ini: Isn't it cuuuuute? I, like, totally bought that! Phoenix: Ah... so it's yours, huh? Ini: Yeah. So, like, this village is really famous for, like, channeling and bears. Phoenix: Heh. (...Wait. Famous for bears!?) Ini: But it's, like, OK. If you ever, like, see a bear, you just play dead, and they, like, leave you alone. Phoenix: I-Is that right? Ini: Yeah. Cause, like, fighting back is totally of no use. Phoenix: (Has she actually tried to fight one!?) Yellow box Phoenix: Hmm, now where did this box come from? I'm sure this wasn't here last night. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom. Talk Ini Miney Phoenix: So? Why are you still here today? Ini: Like, there's so much for me to, like, study here! Phoenix: Like what? Ini: Like, the medium's training, or like, how they inherit their spiritual power. Phoenix: (I suppose... This village is the real thing, after all.) Ini: So, like, I asked if I could stay here for, like, a little longer. Phoenix: (She sure seems like the care-free type, at least, on the surface...) What happened Phoenix: Have you heard about the murder? Ini: It's, like, totally scary. Phoenix: (...she says, with a silly smile plastered on her face...) ...So do you know anything about it that might help? Ini: ... Phoenix: (Somehow, I don't think she has a grip on reality, let alone what's going on here.) The victim Phoenix: About the victim, Dr. Grey... Ini: I don't know who you're talking about. ...Like... Wait, I think you asked about him, like, yesterday, too... Phoenix: (That's right... Her reaction yesterday when I asked was...) Phoenix: You and Dr. Grey knew each other, right? Ini: ...! I don't know any Dr. Grey! Phoenix: Oh really...? Then what was all that talk about him earlier? (Changed from [That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...] in the original release) Ini: Huh!? ...Well, uh... Like, a long, long time ago... I was, like, a patient, yeah. Phoenix: (OK, she is definitely hiding something from me...) Ini: ...Like, is something wrong? Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Would you take a look at this? Ini: Hey! It's, like, one of those little badges people in Congress all wear... Phoenix: No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. L-A-W-Y-E-R!! Ini: ...? Like, so is that what you are? Maya's Magatama Ini: Wow! It's a Magatama! Aww, you shouldn't have! Phoenix: It's so totally not for you! Ini: Hey! Like, it's not nice to freak me out like that! Phoenix: (That should be my line...) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about this girl... Ini: Oh, that's, like, Maya Fey. She's, like, the Master's daughter. Phoenix: You surprise me. You knew that? Ini: Well, like, I totally know everyone related to the occult. Maya is, like, an idol among spirit mediums. Phoenix: (Maya an idol? I guess stranger things have happened.) Morgan Fey profile Ini: That's Morgan Fey. Like, she's been totally helpful. Phoenix: (Did she just bow to the picture...?) Ini: So what about her? Phoenix: Oh, nothing in particular. I just wanted to know what you knew about her. Ini: Um... Well, she's, like, a really good person. Phoenix: I see. Ini: Like totally. Phoenix: OK. (This is going nowhere...) Ini Miney profile Ini: Um... This face... Like, I think I've seen it somewhere before... Phoenix: What!? ...Y-You're joking, right? Ini: Ha ha, like, of course I am, silly! Phoenix: (Oh, thank goodness...) Any other evidence Ini: Like, I'm really sorry, but... And I know, like, you totally had your heart set on it, but I can't, like, take it. Phoenix: (Who said anything about giving this to you!?) Any other profile Phoenix: What do you know about this person...? Ini: I'm, like, sorry, but it's totally, like, time for my nap... Phoenix: *yawn* (Ack! She's even got ME yawning!) Ini: And I, like, totally don't care about that person anyway... After clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber, and clearing \"The victim\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Side Room: June 20Fey ManorWinding Way Pearl: ... Phoenix: Ack! Y-You surprised me! Pearl: ... Phoenix: And how are you today? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Hmm... I guess she isn't open to friendly chatting... Huh? She's still holding something in her hand... ...It looks like the same thing she had yesterday...) Talk Any option Phoenix: Um... Pearl: Aaaah! Phoenix: H-Huh?? (If only I had something that would catch her interest. Maybe then she'd talk to me.) Present Maya's Magatama Leads to: \"Oh yeah. Maya said to give this to you...\" Anything else Phoenix: Can you take a look at this? Please? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Urk... She's really scrutinizing my face...) Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Th-That's enough already! I'm not that shifty-looking, am I!?) Phoenix: Oh yeah. Maya said to give this to you... Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Ack! I'm in trouble now!! If Morgan sees us like this, I'll be the next one they're channeling...) Pearl: Th-That's... That's Mystic Maya's... Phoenix: ...Huh!? (Sh-She actually spoke!) Pearl: Who are you...? Phoenix: I-I'm Phoenix Wright. I, uh, worked with Maya... Pearl: ...Y-You worked with Mystic Maya...? You... You're Mr. Nick, right? Phoenix: ...Uh, excuse me? (I bet I know who she picked \"Nick\" up from...) Pearl: I know who you are. You're... You're Mystic Maya's... \"special someone\"... Phoenix: WH-WH-WH-WHAT!? Pearl: So then... Of course! You're going to help Mystic Maya, aren't you? That's what you're going to do, right? Phoenix: W-Well, yeah... I will... Pearl: Oh wow... It's like a beautiful fairy tale! That earnest look shining brightly in your eyes... It must be true love... Phoenix: ...Wh-What!? (Why am I being boiled into a bright red lobster by this little kid!?) Pearl: I'm so jealous of Mystic Maya! Ah, what a wonderful relationship... Phoenix: W-Wait... I... uhh... I mean... We aren't... Things aren't like... Pearl: Hee hee, I can tell you're a good person. Alright, Mr. Nick! I may be small, but I'm going to help you in any way I can! Talk Pearl Phoenix: Pearl, are you friends with Maya? Pearl: I feel very grateful to be friends with her... She's so great. I want to be like Mystic Maya when I grow up. I really look up to her. Phoenix: Wow, I had no idea Maya was so... revered. Pearl: Usually when people don't use Mystic Maya's title, I get mad. Phoenix: O-Oh, sorry. Pearl: But if it's you, Mr. Nick, then it's OK. Because... Because... you're \"special\" to her. Phoenix: (Where in the world did she get an idea like that??) Pearl: By the way... this may be rude, but which channeling school are you from? Phoenix: Which channeling school? Pearl: Yes. For example, I study the Kurain technique. Phoenix: ... Ah, I get it! No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. A lawyer. Pearl: ...Law...yer? Phoenix: Yup. Pearl: ...Is that related to spirit mediums in any way...? Phoenix: (Um... None that I know of...) Wait, are you telling me you don't know what a lawyer is? Pearl: I'm sorry, but I have no idea. Phoenix: (Maya did say Pearl doesn't know much about the outside world...) The item in your hand Phoenix: So what's that you've got there, Pearl? Pearl: Oh, this? I found it yesterday. Phoenix: Hmm... Pearl: If you want it, I can give it to you. Accept it Leads to: \"Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me...\" Don't accept it Phoenix: I can't take something this important from you, Pearl. Pearl: Oh... Phoenix: (But I'm sure I've seen that key somewhere before... ...and it might be an important clue later on...) Leads to: \"Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me...\" Phoenix: Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me... Pearl: Hee hee. You look like a child at a toy store, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (...She not only speaks in a refined manner, but laughs in one, too!) Black Key added to the Court Record. Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: So this is... Pearl: That is Mystic Maya's Magatama. It's one of the most important heirlooms of Kurain Village. Please make sure to take good care of it. Phoenix: Y-Yeah, I will. (Is it really OK for me to have such a priceless object?) Folding Screen Pearl: Are you interested in Kurain's traditional things too, Mr. Nick? The Kurain Sacred Writings are on this folding screen. Phoenix: Oh? Is that what's written on it? Actually, what caught my eye was this \"hole\" in it... Pearl: It's a very old screen, so I think that maybe bugs made it by eating through it. Phoenix: (...It sure doesn't look like something bugs can make...) Black Key Phoenix: About this key... Pearl: I found it while I was playing in the garden yesterday. Phoenix: I've seen it before too, you know? Pearl: ...? Really? Maya Fey profile Pearl: I look up to Mystic Maya a lot. She's my role model. She's so smart, and pretty, and kind, and loving. She's always cheerful, never gets sick, isn't picky, and has good sleeping habits. She always wakes up before me, and always eats breakfast before me too. And she has you; such a wonderful person with whom she can share a lo- Phoenix: Ack! OK, OK! I get the idea! (She really thinks the world of Maya, doesn't she?) Pearl Fey profile Pearl: To tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother won't let me. Phoenix: Your hair now suits you quite well, though, I think. Pearl: R-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget* Phoenix: *fidget, fidget* Morgan Fey profile Pearl: Oh, it's my mother! She takes really good care of me and loves me very much. She says I'm the \"pride of the branch family\"... But I don't know what that means. Phoenix: (\"Branch family\"... That concept is probably still too hard for little Pearl...) Any other evidence Pearl: I'm sure it is helpful to you in some way, but I'm still in training, so I don't know anything about it. I'm really, deeply sorry. Phoenix: No, no, no, it's OK. I shouldn't have shown you something so trivial anyway. I'm very sorry. (This feels so weird, talking to a kid like this...) Any other profile Pearl: Hmm, I'm sorry I don't know who this person is. Phoenix: I guess that makes sense... You've never left Kurain village, after all. Pearl: I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick. I just don't really know anyone outside the village. After clearing all Talk options: Pearl: Um, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: Yes, Pearls? I can call you that, right? You're too cute to just call you Pearl. Pearl: Sure, Mr. Nick... Umm... Are you sure it's OK for me to have this Magatama? Phoenix: Yeah, it's OK. I was told to give it to you. Pearl: But, I can't accept something like this! ...All I really should do is charge this Magatama with spiritual energy... Phoenix: Spiritual energy? Pearl: Please take this. I'm sure it will be helpful. Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Pearl: It will let you see people's secrets. Phoenix: See people's... secrets...? Pearl: Yes. ...If it's alright with you, I would like to accompany you for a little while. I can explain the Magatama's power to you when we meet someone hiding a secret. June 20Fey ManorMeditation Room Gumshoe: Hey, it's you, pal! So you're going to be her lawyer, I bet. Phoenix: Yes. Gumshoe: Oh... I really feel bad for you, pal. Just this once, I wish I could be on your side. Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Yeah, but I shouldn't be saying that kind of stuff to you. Hey! You're a cute kid. Pearl: ... Gumshoe: Ha ha ha. I'm not scary. Honest! Phoenix: (Wow, I never knew Gumshoe liked kids...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! I know! I'll show you something cool! How's this? It's a real, genuine pistol... Phoenix: D-Detective Gumshoe!! What are you doing showing her something that dangerous! Gumshoe: Oh, sorry... Talk Maya's guilt Phoenix: What about Maya and the charges against her? Gumshoe: I don't think you can win, pal. If you're talking about proof, we've got a few pieces. Phoenix: You've got proof...? Gumshoe: Yeah, pal. That puffy-haired photographer's going to testify tomorrow. Phoenix: (He must be talking about Lotta. Actually... speaking of Lotta...) Lotta: I took some hot pictures earlier! Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: Remember!? I took some pictures at the murder scene inside! Phoenix: (Lotta's \"hot pictures\"... I wonder what her camera captured...?) Gumshoe: ...Besides, you must've realized by now, pal. There's no way anyone other than Maya Fey could've done it. Phoenix: (...!) Pearl: ... Phoenix: (What am I supposed to say to Pearls now...?) The victim Phoenix: About Dr. Grey... Gumshoe: The victim wasn't super famous, but people still knew who he was. His face was all over those tabloid shows last year. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Gumshoe: I was looking through some newspapers from last year, and... ... Huh? I could've sworn I had... I cut an article out, but I guess I must've lost it... Phoenix: (He's searching through his pockets... And boy, are those big...) Gumshoe: Hmm... It looked really interesting, too. Hey, do you have a copy, pal? Phoenix: (A copy of that article...? I think Dr. Grey might have brought a copy to the office when he came by...) Tomorrow's trial Phoenix: About Maya's trial tomorrow... Gumshoe: I've got two pieces of news for you, pal. Phoenix: Two? Gumshoe: Yeah. \"Bad news\" and \"even worse news.\" So which do you want to hear first? Phoenix: ...I don't really care... It doesn't change the fact that I'm not going to like it. Gumshoe: Alright, pal. Well, the prosecutor for the trial is Prosecutor von Karma. Phoenix: WHAT!? Von Karma!? Phoenix: (Manfred von Karma... He was an awe-inspiring veteran prosecutor. He never lost a case in the 40 years of his career, and he raised a fearsome disciple. The horrible aftertaste of the evil he force-fed me is something I'll never forget.) Phoenix: ... Wait a sec. But didn't Von Karma stand trial and... Gumshoe: That's where the other piece of bad news comes in... The Von Karma you're facing tomorrow is actually his successor... Phoenix: Successor...? Successor (appears after \"Tomorrow's trial\") Phoenix: So, um... Who is this \"successor\" to Von Karma? Gumshoe: Literally, pal, it's Prosecutor von Karma's kid. His kid became a prosecutor real young... like 13, and hasn't lost a trial since. That's what they call a \"prodigy,\" pal. Phoenix: Hmm... Kid, huh... ... W-W-Wait a sec! Th-Th-Thirteen!? The kid became a prosecutor at the age of THIRTEEN!? I mean, a prodigy like that... I would have heard something about... Gumshoe: Oh, no, no. The kid was born and raised in Germany, pal. That country's got a lot of stuff and is a great place to develop a person's talents. Phoenix: (Germany, huh? That's probably why I've never heard of this person. Ugh... Still, all it takes is someone mentioning the name \"Von Karma\", and I get terrible flashbacks to that case. Stop it! Get a grip on yourself, Phoenix! (Changed from [Stop it! Get over it, Phoenix!] in the original release) None of that matters anymore... now that he's gone... (Changed from [That person is already gone...] in the original release)) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Pearl: Uh, um... Mr. Nick? Phoenix: What is it, Pearls? Pearl: I was wondering if I could see it, too? Phoenix: Ah, no, it's OK. It's not that important anyway. Maya's Magatama Phoenix: What do you think about this...? Gumshoe: Hey, that's a pretty nice-looking brooch! You should stop wearing that ugly old attorney's badge, and start wearing that, pal. Pearl: Hee, hee. That detective is so nice! Aren't you happy, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (Happy?... About what?) Newspaper Clipping 1 Phoenix: Um, Dr. Grey brought this over to my office the other day, and... Gumshoe: Hey! It's that news story! The one about the malpractice suit! Phoenix: Fourteen patients died and it caused a huge stink. Gumshoe: Yeah, but that's not all, pal. Things only got worse after that. Phoenix: You mean the car accident the nurse died in? Gumshoe: ...Hmm... Oh, here we go. I brought my own clipping with me today. Here, pal, this is for you. Phoenix: Alright. Thanks. Newspaper Clipping 2 added to the Court Record. Newspaper Clipping 1 (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The nurse that killed the patients ended up getting killed in an accident. Dr. Grey wound up on a lot of tabloid shows because of that. Now, there was a smart man. I'm sure that was a great way to advertise for his clinic. Phoenix: (Uh, huh. Scaring people off is always the best way to get more patients.) Black Key Phoenix: So about this key... Gumshoe: Hey, is that your house key or something, pal? Phoenix: Come on, does this look like a house key to you? Gumshoe: Then what's it for? Phoenix: It's... ... (Hmm, actually, I should probably keep that a secret...) It's my bicycle key. Gumshoe: Oh. Nothing special, huh? Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: I'm sorry things had to turn out this way, pal. Phoenix: It's too early to give up! No one's proven her guilty of anything, yet! Gumshoe: Look, even if there were a zillion of you, pal, this is a case you... *sigh* Phoenix: (Now why is he sighing?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Oh, so that's little Pearl. Phoenix: Do you know her? Gumshoe: Only that Ms. Fey was looking for her earlier. Something about being worried that she'll end up talking to the weird guy. So, you have any idea who this \"weird guy\" is, pal? Phoenix: ...Nope. Not a clue. Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: That's Maya's aunt, right? I got to eat one of her giant strawberry desserts earlier. It was really good! Phoenix: (Aw, I didn't get to eat one yet...) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Boy do I look scary in this picture. I guess if I want people to stop thinking cops are scary, I have to change myself. Gotta smile, gotta smile! Phoenix: (There's that classic Gumshoe goofy smile again...) Any other evidence Gumshoe: Ooh, I'd better shut my mouth. Phoenix: Uh, what? Gumshoe: I'm not gonna give you any information about evidence, pal. Phoenix: Oh. Any other profile Gumshoe: I don't have anything to tell you about this one, pal. Phoenix: You don't have to be so mean about it. Gumshoe: Not. A. Word. Pearl: ... Gumshoe: H-H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Phoenix: (That girl has one intense stare... *gulp*) June 20Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: Hello again. We seem to be seeing a lot of each other today. Ini: Aww, she's, like, tooootally cute! Is she, like, your daughter? Phoenix: W-What!? NO! (How old do you think I am!?) Talk The victim Phoenix: I want to ask you about the victim, Dr. Grey. Ini: I, like, totally don't know him. 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: Aaack! What is that!? Ini: ...? Pearl: You can see it, can't you, Mr. Nick? You can see the \"lock\" on that person's heart. Phoenix: Huh, what...? Pearl: This is the power of the Magatama. Only you can see these \"Psyche-Locks\", Mr. Nick. Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks, huh...) Pearl: The more someone wants to hide their secret, the more locks you will see. If it's only one, I think you can easily unlock it. Phoenix: \"Unlock\"...? But how? Pearl: Please use Mystic Maya's Magatama on this person, and let's remove the lock. Phoenix: (I have no idea what she's talking about, but... Guess I'll give it a try.) Pearl: You must be careful, though, Mr. Nick. If you make a mistake, it will hurt you. If you don't think you have the proof you need, you must have the courage to stop. Phoenix: (Well, I've got to start somewhere. Let's give this Psyche-Lock thing a try.) The victim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Iim going to ask you again. Did you know Dr. Grey? Ini: I totally don't know that guy. Like, you're totally more presistent than a roach! 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (This girl is hiding something! I'm sure of it! I guess I have no choice but to remove this lock. Alright, so first, I have to use Maya's Magatama...) The victim (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Leads to: \"Please, tell me all you know about Dr. Grey.\" Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- The Victim -- Phoenix: Ini Miney. I believe you do know who Dr. Grey is! Ini: I told you! Like, how many times do I, like, have to repeat myself? If you're, like, so totally sure, then where's, like, your proof? Phoenix: While it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person, I do believe you might have at least, indirectly known of him. Ini: Like, what do you mean, like, \"indirectly\"...? Phoenix: (I should try to show that the possibility existed for now...) (Hmm, so, something that shows a possible connection between Ini and Dr. Grey...) Present Newspaper Clipping 2 Phoenix: Leads to: \"Take a look at this newspaper clipping.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here is your proof! Ini: Like, what is that...? Phoenix: Ouch... I guess it doesn't have anything to do with it, huh? (Pearls did warn me... \"If you make a mistake, it will hurt you,\" she said. If I don't have enough evidence, I should probably \"stop\". I should take another look at the Court Record and think it through one more time.) Leads back to: \"While it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person,\" Phoenix: Take a look at this newspaper clipping. Ini: Like, what is it? ... A story about an accident? Phoenix: Please read the victim's name. Ini: Um...\"Mimi Miney\"... Phoenix: \"Miney\" is a pretty rare last name, wouldn't you say? Ms. Mimi Miney wouldn't happen to be a relative of yours, would she? Ini: ...! So you noticed. Sh-She was my older sister. Phoenix: I'm sorry about your loss... Your sister... Was she a nurse... Perhaps at Dr. Grey's surgical clinic? Ini: ...! Phoenix: Grey Surgical Clinic... I don't think I need to tell you that the clinic was run by the victim, Dr. Turner Grey. Which is how you knew of Dr. Grey; you knew him through your sister! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Phoenix: Please, tell me all you know about Dr. Grey. Ini: My... My sister's name was Mimi Miney. She was, like, a nurse at Dr. Grey's clinic. Phoenix: (That's what I thought...) Ini: I heard that, like, Dr. Grey was really tough on people. Like, a total slave driver. My sis was, like, always coming home totally wiped out 'cause she was overworked. Phoenix: Wiped out? So is that why she fell asleep at the wheel? Ini: That guy, like, drove my sis so hard, so, like, that's why the accident happened. Phoenix: The one where 14 patients died from malpractice? Ini: Yeah, like, I think that was the doctor's fault, too. My sis was pushed by, like, everyone's expectations and, like, her duties and stuff. And that pushed her to her death. Phoenix: Oh... I'm sorry... Ini: So, like, are we done? I've, like, already told my story to, like, everyone... Pearl: Do you understand now, Mr. Nick? This is how a Psyche-Lock works. Phoenix: ...Well, I don't plan to pry into people's hearts unless I absolutely need to... Pearl: The lock this time was pretty easy, but... you might meet people who aren't as willing to give in later on. If you don't have enough proof, be careful and know when to stop trying. After clearing \"Successor\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Meditation Room and clearing \"The victim\" Talk option upon breaking Psyche-Lock in Fey Manor - Side Room: June 20Kurain Village Pearl: Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Hmm? What's wrong? Pearl: I have never left Kurain Village. Phoenix: R-Really? Wow, that's, um, pretty amazing... Pearl: You are going to meet with Mystic Maya... aren't you? Please tell her I said hi. Phoenix: Hey, wait! (She ran off... Again. Well, I know Ini's secret now, but... I still don't have any idea how I'm going to save Maya. I don't even know if I should go in there with a smile or a straight face... *sigh*) June 20Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (What am I supposed to do!? I'm almost out of time! Can I really do anything? Can I really save her...?) ???: Sorry to keep you waiting. Phoenix: (Huh? Must be Maya...) ???: It's been a long time, hasn't it, Phoenix? Phoenix: ...! (That voice...) M-Mia! Mia: Even without me being here, it looks like you've learned to stand on your own. Phoenix: (Mia... She's Maya's older sister, and my mentor. She was a top-notch defense lawyer, but a certain case forced her into \"retirement\". But... whenever I'm in trouble, she comes to help, just like this. Her spirit comes back from the other world and borrows Maya's body for a bit...) Mia: Phoenix, you can't make that kind of face in front of your client. Phoenix: ...! Mia: A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets, and especially when it's bad. Phoenix: Mia... Mia: You can't smile at the end if you haven't been smiling the whole way there. In any case, the face you're making now is no face to show a client, Phoenix. Phoenix: B-But! Mia: So, tell me all about it. I'm going to guess that my sister is in a lot of trouble again... Phoenix: (I told her everything about what had happened in the last two days. Mia closed her eyes, deep in thought, while she listened...) Mia: ...I see... Phoenix: Mia... What am I supposed to do? Mia: ... It's pretty clear what a good lawyer does in this situation. Phoenix: A-And that is!? Tell me, please! Mia: Believe in your convictions. And fight for the complete acquittal of your client. Talk Not guilty Phoenix: You think Maya's not guilty!? How can you be so sure!? Mia: I know she is. And I'll give you a hint as to why. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: Mediums can't have dreams. Phoenix: Can't have \"dreams\"...? Mia: From what you told me, it sounds like Maya was having a dream while channeling. Phoenix: Yeah... She said she dream that she had died and had been buried in the ground. Mia: But that is impossible. You've heard it from her, I'm sure. When a medium channels, her own spirit disappears. Which means that it's impossible for her to dream during that time. Phoenix: ...! Then... What does this mean!? Mia: I think it's safe to bet that Maya was set-up. Phoenix: A set-up!? Mia: It's up to you to blow the lid on this case tomorrow and show how she was set-up. Evidence? Phoenix: How am I supposed to prove her innocence when I have nothing to go on!? Mia: If you're looking for a clue, it's already in your hands. Phoenix: I-It is!? Mia: Just as it sounds, Phoenix, you already hold the \"key\". Phoenix: (R-Really...?) Mia: Come on, show me the \"key\" to this case. Phoenix: (The \"key\", huh? Alright, I'll show it to her; the \"key\" I hold.) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Mia... Mia: *chuckle* Wow, this badge brings back a lot of memories, doesn't it...? I would love to stand with you at the defense table one more time. Phoenix: (Mia...) Maya's Magatama Mia: This is... Maya's Magatama, isn't it? Why do you have it...? Phoenix: Maya gave it to me, but... Mia: I see... ... This is something very important to me. Take good care of it, OK? Phoenix: (She looks at it with such a soft look in her eyes...) Black Key Phoenix: Mia, have you seen this key before? Mia: Ahh, the key... It's literally, the key to understanding everything that's happened in this case. Phoenix: This key? Mia: Phoenix, listen. Right now, that key is sitting in your hand. However, it shouldn't be. ... It contradicts the \"facts\". Phoenix: (What does she mean...?) Mia: I'm certain this key will be the piece of evidence that makes your case tomorrow. Maya Fey profile Mia: I can't see Maya... when I'm in her body like this... But I can tell. She's very lonely and sad. Take good care of her, will you, Phoenix? Phoenix: I-I will... Pearl Fey profile Mia: Pearly! She's really grown up... I left Kurain Village a long time ago. She probably doesn't remember a thing about me by now... Morgan Fey profile Mia: I'm afraid I might have caused Aunt Morgan a lot of stress. When I left Kurain, I left Maya in my aunt's care. And now something like this happens... Dick Gumshoe profile Mia: I've seen this man somewhere before... He had a strange name... and I'm almost sure I've questioned him before. I remember him making a show of confidence at first, but after five minutes, he breaks down and... ...you end up feeling bad for the poor guy... Mia Fey profile Mia: That's right. I'm already dead. But I feel very grateful to have been born a Fey... so I can talk with you like this... Any other evidence Phoenix: Could you take a look at this? Mia: ...Do you have anything more useful? There's no time left. Try to show me something that will help you in tomorrow's trial. Any other profile Mia: I'm sorry, but I don't remember who that is... After clearing all Talk options and presenting Black Key: Mia: ... ... You already know everything you need to know. You know what the \"key\" to this case is... That is enough... Phoenix: But... But! How can I win tomorrow without knowing who the real murderer is!? Who... Who could have...? Mia: ... Phoenix: (I didn't know it at the time, (Changed from [At the time, I didn't know,] in the original release) but this day was going to end with a turn for the surprising...) 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: M-Mia!? Wh-What...!? Mia: What's wrong? Phoenix: (That's right. Only I can see the Psyche-Locks... Which means... Mia must know something about the real murderer! But for this to be something that she would hide under lock and key from even me... What in the world is going on!?) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!) Reunion, and Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 June 21, 9:48 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Maya: Whaaaaaaaat!? Prosecutor von Karma!? You mean...? Phoenix: No, I heard it's his successor this time... Maya: Successor...? ... Manfred von Karma... was a really sinister man. (Changed from [Manfred von Karma. He was a really sinister man.] in the original release) He pulled all sorts of nasty tricks; all so he could win. Phoenix: (He was a man obsessed with the word \"perfection\"... He had a perfect record... for forty long years. Who knows what sorts of dirty tricks he used to get each of those guilty verdicts? And now, his successor... I wonder what kind of person they will turn out to be...) Maya: It's no good... Mystic Maya!! Maya: Pearly! You showed up! Thanks for coming all this way! Pearl: I was really worried about you... Maya: Hey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together? Pearl: Mother is watching over the trainees. She said they have training for two days straight with no breaks. Maya: Huh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself? Pearl: Yup! I snuck out of the manor and followed a map. Phoenix: Don't tell me you walked all the way here... Pearl: Of course not! ...I ran! Phoenix: That's... I can't... Oh my... (If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...) Maya: Pearly... What about the train? Pearl: Huh? What's a... \"tray-in\"? Phoenix: (I give up...) Pearl: ...It's time, isn't it? Maya: Um... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma! Pearl: Mr. Eh-ji-werth? Who is that? Maya: Um, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend. I still remember him as though I'd seen him only yesterday. (Changed from [I still remember him as if I had just seen him only yesterday.] in the original release) Every trial was a scorchingly fierce battle until the very end. (Changed from [Every trial was a scorching fierce battle until the very end.] in the original release) It was always back and forth with them. But when you're rivals for life... Phoenix: Maya! Please don't mention that name ever again... Maya: Huh...? But why, Nick? Phoenix: I'm... I'm sorry, Maya. I forgot you don't know... He... He's... He's gone... And he's not coming back... Maya: Whaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!? Bailiff: Court will commence shortly. Please proceed into the courtroom. Phoenix: ... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway. Maya: N...Nick...? June 21, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey. Are the prosecution and the defense prepared? ???: ... Phoenix: ... (What is with this kid...?) (Changed from [... (What is with this girl...?)] in the original release) Judge: ... *Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you prepared!? (Changed from [*Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you finally prepared!?] in the original release) Phoenix: Huh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. (Why does he always seem mad at me!?) ???: Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: ...! ???: You must be a little shocked because I am a woman, correct? Phoenix: (...Hold on. So SHE'S the famed \"successor\" to Prosecutor von Karma...?) (Changed from [...Hold on. So this kid is the 'famed' Prosecutor von Karma...?] in the original release) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: Revenge...? (Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?) Judge: Um... If it's something of a personal nature, I'm sure you can... Oww! von Karma: I'm talking. If you interrupt again, my whip will do the speaking for me. Phoenix: (Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...) Yeow!! von Karma: Make no mistake; I will defeat you! Prepare to go down, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Judge: Prosecutor von Karma, your opening statement, please... von Karma: Those of Von Karma blood have only one fate. And that is \"perfection\". The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch. Judge: V-Very well... What is the defense's position? Phoenix: Your Honor. Judge: Does the defense wish to enter a plea of \"not guilty\"? Phoenix: ...Yes. von Karma: Foolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the \"justified self-defense\" plea in no time. Phoenix: (\"Justified self-defense\"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of themself. (Changed from [A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself.] in the original release) We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of \"not guilty\", Your Honor! (Because to plead \"justified self-defense\" is to say you did kill someone.) von Karma: How foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness. Phoenix: (She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.) von Karma: Witness, your name and occupation? Gumshoe: Yes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!! von Karma: Get to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder. Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room. Judge: What were they doing in there? Gumshoe: Um... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir. Judge: Ch-Channeling a spirit?? Phoenix: (That's quite the look of disbelief there, Your Honor...) (Changed from [The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...] in the original release) Gumshoe: *ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room. Judge: Ah, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over. Floor Plans added to the Court Record. Judge: So, how was the victim killed? Gumshoe: I was about to get to that... von Karma: Stop wasting my time, then. Witness Testimony -- Cause of Death -- Gumshoe: The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir. The shot was fired from point-blank range. But before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest. The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death. The murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing. Judge: Hmm... So the victim was stabbed before being shot... Gumshoe: This is the victim's autopsy report, sir. Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: The court accepts it into evidence. Mr. Wright, you may question the witness. Cross Examination -- Cause of Death -- Gumshoe: The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The murder weapon, Detective Gumshoe. Whose pistol was it? Gumshoe: It was the victim's. Phoenix: The victim? Now, why would he have... von Karma: von Karma: \"Why would he have a pistol?\" Who cares? The point that you are missing is whose fingerprints are on that pistol. If you're not already paying attention to that, then I suggest you start. Judge: Fingerprints? There were fingerprints? Gumshoe: Along with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir. Judge: Hmm. So the defendant's fingerprints were left on the murder weapon... Phoenix: (Argh...! I walked right into her hands there.) (Changed from [Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.] in the original release) Gumshoe: The shot was fired from point-blank range. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Point blank, huh? So about how far away was it? Gumshoe: It was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away. Phoenix: And how do you know he was shot at point blank? von Karma: Tsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I grow tired of the foolish foolery of the foolish fools of this foolish country... Phoenix: E-Excuse me!? von Karma: Gunpowder burn. Phoenix: ...Gunpowder burn? von Karma: When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole. Gumshoe: Gunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead! Phoenix: (Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...) Gumshoe: But before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Stabbed... And what was he stabbed with? Gumshoe: A fruit knife. Judge: I see. And whose knife was it? Gumshoe: It looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it. Judge: Hmm... All over it, huh? Phoenix: (Urk. This does not look good...) von Karma: Ha ha ha. What will you do now, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Gumshoe: The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How severe was the wound? Gumshoe: If it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand. Phoenix: (This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...) Gumshoe: The murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure he was stabbed first, then shot? Gumshoe: Yup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal. von Karma: A fool is a fool who will only listen to the foolish opinions of other foolish fools... A pistol shot to the forehead at point blank is certainly enough to kill instantly. Does it matter, then, which was first? Think a little more before you open that big mouth of yours, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Grr... What a pain...) Phoenix: (Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...) After pressing first, second, third, and fifth statements: Judge: That's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered. Gumshoe: I brought the two murder weapons with me today. Judge: Very well. The court accepts them into evidence. Pistol added to the Court Record. Knife added to the Court Record. von Karma: The date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time. Judge: And two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them, huh... (Changed from [And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...?] in the original release) Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case. von Karma: Naturally! Phoenix: (This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...) von Karma: Your Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there? Judge: That is quite true... Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Judge: Even in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead \"not guilty\"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose. von Karma: See, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes... Judge: What will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to \"justified self-defense\"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance. Phoenix: (This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!) Plead justified self-defense Phoenix: (If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to \"justified self-defense\"... von Karma: Hah. Judge: Understood. Let the record show that the defense has entered a new plea. Phoenix: (...There's nothing else I could do... Mia...?) Mia: ...You already hold the key... ...If you don't believe, you cannot win... Phoenix: (...! If we plead \"justified self-defense\", we would basically be confessing to murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'll be labeled a murderer... Can I really... Can I really let that happen!?) Your Honor! Judge: Y-Yes? Phoenix: The defense... The defense retracts its previous statement. And instead, will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant is not guilty! Leads to: \"...You.\" Plead not guilty Phoenix: (If we plead \"justified self-defense\"... we would basically be confessing to a murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'd be labeled a murderer... I can't let that happen!) Your Honor! Judge: Have you reached a conclusion, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The defense will not change its plea. We will accept nothing short of complete acquittal! Leads to: \"...You.\" von Karma: ...You. You have sealed your fate, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Detective! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! von Karma: Present the final portion of your testimony -- the final strike. Gumshoe: Um... Y-Yes... sir... Judge: N-Now, see here! Proceedings are run by... Eek! von Karma: ... Judge: Oh, yes, of course. Go ahead Detective and give your testimony... von Karma: I think the court would like to hear about the other piece of incriminating evidence! Witness Testimony -- Incriminating Evidence -- Gumshoe: Sorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence. This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime. As you can see, it's covered in blood. The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back. Judge: So this is the costume... There certainly is evidence of a back spray of blood on this. Gumshoe: This piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir. Judge: I see... The court accepts this into evidence. Maya's Costume added to the Court Record. Judge: Alright, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??) von Karma: Hah. What's wrong? You seem to be at a loss. I think this is the last piece of testimony the prosecution should have to offer. Feel free to sulk off with your tail between your legs, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Please stop calling me by my full name. It's disturbing.) Cross Examination -- Incriminating Evidence -- Gumshoe: Sorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why didn't you say so in your testimony earlier!? Gumshoe: Uh... You're kinda scary today, you know, pal? Judge: Come now, Mr. Wright... There is no need for that kind of attitude in my court... Phoenix: ... Judge: A-Alright. Just, please stop glaring at me like that... Gumshoe: This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Maya's... costume? Gumshoe: Yeah. She was wearing this when we arrested her. Phoenix: (Maya... She's wearing her channeling costume today too... Is she not allowed to wear anything else...?) Gumshoe: As you can see, it's covered in blood. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: This blood on the costume... Gumshoe: Lab results show that it is the victim's blood. Judge: Hmm... So there is blood from the victim on the defendant's clothes. Phoenix: (Definitely not good...) (Changed from [Definitely not good... Urk.] in the original release) So, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence? (Changed from [Hmm, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Um, well... von Karma: von Karma: If you must change the topic, then the good detective here must testify again. But too bad. Not enough time. Let's move on. (Changed from [But too bad. Not enough time. Time to move on.] in the original release) Judge: Ah, yes, Ms. von Karma is perfectly correct... Phoenix: (Grr... Now even the Judge is on her side! But if I bite off more than I can chew here... What should I do!?) Press further Phoenix: (Why is Ms. von Karma suddenly putting up resistance? There must be a reason as to why she suddenly threw out an objection like that... There must be something about this costume...! (Changed from [There must be a clue somewhere on this costume!] in the original release) I just have to look harder!) Judge: Mr. Wright. Ms. von Karma's logic is perfect. There is no way for you to poke a hole in it. Phoenix: (Argh! Looks like my time is up. So, about the costume...) There is nothing wrong. Phoenix: (If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this. Judge: Good. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination There is one little thing... Phoenix: Your Honor. Actually, there is something very wrong with this piece of evidence. Judge: Wh-What!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about, pal!? von Karma: ... Judge: Wh-Where is this problem you are talking about!? Phoenix: (I've come this far... There's no turning back now!) The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here! Present bullet hole on left sleeve Phoenix: Leads to: \"I ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume.\" Present blood splatter Phoenix: Phoenix: The problem is obviously the blood splatter here! Judge: B-But... We've determined that the blood splatter is from the victim. Where is the problem in that? Gumshoe: Yeah, where, pal? Phoenix: Yeah... I wonder about that too... Judge: That last antic of yours just pushed me over the top, Mr. Wright. I hereby declare this cross-examination over... (Changed from [I am declaring that this cross-examination period is over...] in the original release) Phoenix: P-Please wait, Your Honor! (Ack! I'd better not mess up again...) Leads back to: \"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: There is a problem... somewhere around... here! Judge: Wh-What does he mean, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: There's nothing wrong with it. The only thing wrong here is the defense's head. Judge: Well said. You certainly do take after your father! Phoenix: (I've just been made to look like a fool again... Alright... Focus, Phoenix!) Leads back to: \"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\" Phoenix: I ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume. Judge: The sleeve? ...! There is a tiny hole here... Gumshoe: ..A... A hole...? But that wasn't in the report. Judge: Hold on! What's this around the hole? I-It smells faintly of gunpowder! Gumshoe: G-Gunpowder!? No one ever told me! Judge: A hole that smells of gunpowder... Phoenix: (It looks like I've found the \"hole\" I was looking for!) Your Honor, the only logical conclusion you can make is that it must be a bullet hole! Judge: Order! Order! Order!! This is a very grave matter. It's best we correct the Court Record first before anything else. Maya's Costume updated in the Court Record. Gumshoe: Sorry about that. I guess we messed up, sir. von Karma: ... Phoenix: ...! (I-Is she actually... smiling!? What else is she hiding!?) von Karma: Pull yourself together, Detective. That tiny \"hole\" doesn't change a thing. The strength of the evidence still holds. Continue with your testimony. That, just now, was a fluke. Nothing more. Phoenix: Phoenix: H-How can you say something like that!? This is a huge oversight! Judge: While I agree it is a mistake on the part of the police, what Prosecutor von Karma has said is true. The evidence still stands. If you do not find a more definitive problem with the evidence, then... Phoenix: No way!! Judge: Detective Gumshoe, please continue with your testimony. Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir. Leads back to cross-examination Let it go Phoenix: (If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this. Judge: Good. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Alright. I'll give you that the blood spatter is from the victim, but... what is this hole in the sleeve? Gumshoe: Um... Sorry, pal. We must've thought it was just a tear in the seam... Phoenix: Missing the hole is not what I'm asking you about. I'm talking about the hole itself! The smell of gunpowder  clearly gives away that... it is a bullet hole! von Karma: von Karma: As if little things like that matter. Phoenix: But they do. von Karma: A \"bullet hole\" in the sleeve, blood splatter all over the costume... Neither of these things can change the fact the defendant killed the victim. Phoenix: (...Grr... I know there's something more to that costume.) von Karma: Come now Detective. You're wasting precious time. Gumshoe: ... Yes, sir. Gumshoe: The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He wasn't \"fighting back\"? How do you know if he was or wasn't!? Gumshoe: We could find no evidence that the victim put up any sort of struggle, pal. Judge: Hmm... So did the murderer have a fight with the victim, or not? Depending on this, the circumstances around this murder change drastically. Phoenix: (Ugh... We're in real trouble now... If only I had something to prove that the victim did fight back...) Present Maya's Costume (after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Dick Gumshoe!\" Phoenix: (That Von Karma! She thinks she can decide the verdict with this testimony alone! I have to somehow find a critical contradiction and then I'll have her!) Phoenix: Detective Dick Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Y-Yes? Heh, having you call me by my full name is kind of a weird feeling... Phoenix: You said that my client killed \"a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.\" Gumshoe: Yeah, I did. Phoenix: Then what, may I ask, is the bullet hole you police overlooked supposed to mean!? Gumshoe: Eh, um... What does it mean? Phoenix: I'll tell you what it means. It means that the victim had fired off a shot. Is this what it means to \"not fight back\"? Gumshoe: A-Ah! You're right! Judge: It seems you are correct! (Changed from [It would seem that way!] in the original release) If the victim had tried to shoot the defendant, then... it would change everything... (Changed from [If the victim tried to shoot the defendant, then... It would change everything...] in the original release) Phoenix: (Alright! The wind seems to be shifting...) von Karma: Hah. Phoenix: (What is with that \"are you finished yet\" laugh?) von Karma: Are you finished yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Judge: Ms. von Karma? von Karma: It seems... that Maya Fey was shot at by the victim. However, that is only grounds enough to support a \"justified self-defense\" plea. Judge: That is correct. von Karma: But I'm sure you remember, Your Honor, what the defense clearly said. They rejected \"justified self-defense\" and pleaded \"not guilty.\" Phoenix: Ack! Gumshoe: Now that you... Judge: Why, that's right! von Karma: Which means! The defense has yet to prove anything at all! Phoenix: Nooooo!! Judge: W-Well... Yes, that's true... von Karma: Furthermore... just the fact that there is a bullet hole in the costume... is not enough to substantiate even a plea of \"justified self-defense\". Judge: Huh? How so? Gumshoe: Aaah! von Karma: Don't just stand there. Hurry up and tell the court what transpired that day. ...With the new information we acquired added in, of course. Gumshoe: Huh? You mean... By myself...? You want me to put together the scenario all by myself? Aah! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Right away, sir! Witness Testimony -- What Transpired -- Gumshoe: During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest. Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir. While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun. The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed. The defendant then picked up on the opening, took the victim's gun, and ended it... Judge: Hmm... This scenario you have put together does make sense... Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (On the surface, it does seem to make sense... (Changed from [Just by listening, it does make sense...] in the original release) However, I won't give up that easily!) Judge: P-Please refrain from glaring at me like that... Now then, your cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- What Transpired -- Gumshoe: During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: There is quite a difference in height between Dr. Grey and the defendant. Add in body strength, and it seems unlikely the defendant could have stabbed the victim! Gumshoe: Now that you mention it... Yeah, I guess... von Karma: von Karma: You think you can get away with such flimsy reasoning? Mr. Phoenix Wright! Maya Fey was in the middle of channeling, was she not? Phoenix: ...? von Karma: When channeling with the Kurain Channeling Technique, the medium physically changes. With the nurse's build, the defendant could have easily been a match for the doctor. Phoenix: (I don't believe it... She even studied up on the Kurain Channeling Technique!) von Karma: Like I said before... I am perfect. Judge: Um... Uh... About what you were talking about... I didn't quite get it... Phoenix: ... von Karma: ... Judge: Um, n-never mind. Let's continue with the testimony... Gumshoe: Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So he was stabbed, but the stab wound didn't kill him. Gumshoe: But if you think about the blood loss, it was pretty bad. Phoenix: How bad would you say it was? Gumshoe: Actually, I went to give blood the other day. And afterward, I felt a little lightheaded and dizzy. ...I guess the damage was maybe... about 10 times the dizziness...? Ack! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: S-Sorry! Gumshoe: While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where in the world did that pistol come from? Gumshoe: It looks like the victim, Dr. Grey had specifically bought it for that day. Phoenix: But a handgun...? Gumshoe: He got it off the black market about 2 days before the murder. Phoenix: (Why did Dr. Grey bring a gun...? Was he taking precautions against something...?) Gumshoe: The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you're saying that the bullet hole in this costume was made then? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal, but that's what I'd think. The two of them were already fighting when a shot was fired. Phoenix: (Maya... I'm really glad you weren't hurt...) von Karma: ... Present Maya's Costume Phoenix: Leads to: \"Missing the tiny hole on this costume...\" Gumshoe: The defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun, and ended it... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Maya has never fired a gun before in her life! Gumshoe: The victim had already taken off the safety. With the safety off, even an amateur like you can fire it by pulling the trigger. Phoenix: (Even me...? I wonder...?) von Karma: Now do you understand? A Von Karma's logic is perfect. Phoenix: (His testimony certainly makes us look very bad, but there's gotta be a contradiction in there somewhere... And uncovering it is going to uncover the truth! I can feel it!) Phoenix: Missing the tiny hole on this costume... will be the prosecution's undoing. Gumshoe: Eh? What do you mean? Phoenix: This little hole has actually created a huge hole in your testimony! Judge: E-Explain yourself, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: You said the two of them were fighting when the victim fired his gun at point blank. If that were true, then where is the gunpowder burn on this costume!? Gumshoe: G-Gunpowder... burn? Phoenix: This is what you testified earlier: \"When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\" Gumshoe: OH! Phoenix: But there is not a single trace of gunpowder burn on this costume!! Judge: That is a very good point. And... what exactly does this mean? Phoenix: It means that when the shot was fired, they were standing apart from each other. Judge: Hmm... von Karma: von Karma: I'm disappointed, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You think you can punch a hole in my logic with that? With wishy-washy thinking like that, anyone can explain anything away! Phoenix: Then I implore you to disprove my line of thinking. von Karma: Let's see... In the middle of their fight, the victim pushed the defendant away. And it was then, when they were separated, that he fired! How was that? Phoenix: Phoenix: As if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that! von Karma: ...! W-Well... Then... That's right! The defendant must have pushed the victim away! After stabbing him, she must have put some space between the doctor and herself. And then while she was preparing to strike again, the doctor took his shot. There. That sound satisfy even you. Judge: Hmm... That does make an awful lot of sense. What do you think, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (I must be careful. I can't afford to make a mistake here! Concentrate and think!) It makes sense. Phoenix: (Ack, it's no good. I can't find a \"hole\" in her logic at all this time...) I admit it. Somehow, your reasoning makes logical sense. von Karma: That's it. That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Drat. It's 11:00 AM. I've already missed my morning tea. ...However. At least we were able to arrive at a conclusion. Judge: Hmm... It does look that way. Phoenix: (...Oh boy... If I don't do something soon, it'll be curtains for Maya...) Judge: Well then, I think we can... Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! Please... Wait! Judge: Who was that? Mr. Wright? Please refrain from making unnecessary outbursts! Phoenix: (I don't care how, but I must find something to go on in Von Karma's explanation!) Leads to: \"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\" Something doesn't make sense. Leads to: \"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\" Phoenix: There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor! Gumshoe: Fatal...? Judge: Flaw...!? Yeow! von Karma: Very interesting. I would love to see where this \"flaw\" is! Show me something that contradicts my explanation! Phoenix: (There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere! \"She put some distance between them before rushing to make the final blow. And when she was about to strike, the doctor took his shot.\" There must be a piece of evidence that contradicts this line of thinking!) Present Folding Screen Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Take a look at this! Gumshoe: Why are you showing this to me, pal? Phoenix: Prosecutor von Karma's explanation and this piece of evidence... Gumshoe: ...Do not contradict! Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: Haha, looks like you need to use your brain a little more, pal. Phoenix: (Ugh... Being lectured by Gumshoe, of all people, is so embarrassing...) Gumshoe: Come on! Hurry up and get that thinking cap on! Leads back to: \"There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere!\" Phoenix: This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic. Judge: What is that? A folding screen? Phoenix: I would like to point the court's attention to the \"hole\" in this folding screen. von Karma: Aaah! Phoenix: It looks like you already know what I'm talking about. Gumshoe: Who? Where? What? Judge: Mr. Wright! Your explanation, please! Phoenix: (Are these two really that clueless...?) The bullet went through the defendant's sleeve first, then the folding screen. It passed through at a height of approximately 8 inches off the ground... Which means! When the shot was fired, Maya... I mean, the defendant, was not getting ready to strike, but was actually squatting low to the ground! Judge: Order! Order! Th-This changes everything! Phoenix: Please look at this diagram of the crime scene. The victim, Dr. Grey was here when he fired the shot. And the bullet hit this folding screen. It hit at this location, about 8 inches off the ground. At this time, the defendant was in this area. Present area directly in front of bullet hole Phoenix: Leads to: \"She was standing here, near the folding screen!\" Present area behind folding screen Phoenix: Phoenix: Here! Judge: Behind the folding screen...? Phoenix: Ack! von Karma: The victim and his attacker were fighting, were they not? Then what would the attacker be doing all the way back there!? Phoenix: Um... von Karma: Besides which, if the attacker was behind the folding screen, then how could the victim even know where to shoot? It's obviously impossible! Phoenix: ... Yeah, I guess so... Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Boy, did I just screw up royally... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.) Leads back to: \"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: Somewhere around here! Judge: ...? Phoenix: (Uh oh. The judge's face is scrunched like he just smelled some serious bad breath...) Uhh... Um... That is, I mean... Judge: Wait! I just realized I forgot to brush this morning... Excuse me while I freshen up. Phoenix: Uh, sure... Judge: In the meantime, I want you to think things through again, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Ah, of course... Whoops... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.) Leads back to: \"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\" Phoenix: She was standing here, near the folding screen! von Karma: W-Wait a second! We know the defendant was close to the ground based on the height of the bullet hole. But... How can you gauge the distance from that!? Isn't it possible that the defendant was standing much closer to the victim? Phoenix: That's impossible. von Karma: B-But why!? Phoenix: You, of all people, should know the answer to that question, Ms. von Karma. If she were shot from somewhere closer, there would be gunpowder burns present. However! There is nothing of the sort around the bullet hole of this costume! von Karma: Aaaaaah! C-Curse you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You...! Judge: Hmm... I believe it has now been proven that the defendant was standing a ways from the victim when she was shot at. But do you think this has changed the defendant's situation...? It doesn't change anything. Phoenix: (Hmm, even with that explanation, it feels like nothing has changed... But I can't give up just yet!) Leads to: \"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\" It changes everything. Leads to: \"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\" Phoenix: Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything! The prosecution has claimed that the defendant was aiming to kill by stabbing. If that were true, delivering the final strike with the knife would be ideal. However! Where and what was the defendant doing at the time...? Gumshoe: ...Squatting all the way by the folding screen...? Phoenix: Exactly. If Maya Fey was the real murderer, why would she be by the folding screen instead of preparing to strike? von Karma: Nnngh... Judge: Upon further consideration, it does make very little sense. Gumshoe: Yeah, I figured there had to be a reason. Phoenix: Figuring things out and proving the logic behind everything is YOUR job! Gumshoe: Oof... Phoenix: (Alright! With this, the rest of the trial should be in the b--) von Karma: ... Phoenix: (...blast radius of disaster.) von Karma: You are such a smart man, Mr. Phoenix Wright. To think that you've been able to take a completely hopeless case to this point... Now I know why Papa had a tough time with you. Mmm, you amuse me... Phoenix: (Uuugh. Of all the things to inherit, why did it have to be that smarmy smile!?) von Karma: Detective. How dare you damage my perfect logic!? Gumshoe: H-Huh!?... How is it all my fault?? von Karma: You can start repairing your standing by first removing that three-strand \"goatee\". Oh, and rest assured your punishment will come later. Gumshoe: ...P-Punishment... von Karma: Well then, Your Honor, I think I've had all I can take of this detective's face. I think it's time to call in the next witness. Phoenix: (Next witness...? That's gotta be Lotta!) Judge: Very well. The court will take a 5 minute recess. After we reconvene, we will hear from the next witness. To be continued. June 21, 11:37 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Phoenix: Phew, that was a close one. Maya: I know you were giving it your all to defend me. But I could feel the death penalty hanging in the air... Phoenix: I felt like I was pretty close to dying myself... Pearl: But you were wonderful out there. You listened carefully, made theories, and tricked everyone into believing you. Phoenix: Th-Thanks. Wait... Tricked?? Pearl: That must be the \"lawyer's\" secret technique, right? Maya: By the way... Is the next witness who I think it is...? Phoenix: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's Lotta Hart. Maya: Oh... Guess there's no escaping her, huh? (Changed from [Oh... Another jam, like always...] in the original release) Remember, Nick! You promised you'd save me! If you lose, me and my sis's ghosts will come after you and haunt you! (Changed from [If you lose, my ghost will come after you with my sis', and we'll haunt you!] in the original release) Pearl: Your sister...? Um, are you talking about Mystic Mia? Maya: Yeah. Do you remember her, Pearly? My sister was a super good lawyer! She was also Nick's teacher. Pearl: ...Oh, I didn't know that... June 21, 11:43 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2 Judge: Court will now reconvene. Now, the first order of... Oww! von Karma: I don't want to hear it, old man. After I call my witness, sit there quietly and watch like a good little boy. Judge: Y-Yes, sir. von Karma: Bring in the photographer who witnessed the channeling! von Karma: Witness. Your name and occupation, if you please. Lotta: Hey, Phoenix! How ya doin'? Phoenix: Just fine... Lotta: Sorry 'bout this. Didn't exactly have a choice, ya know...? Yeowza! von Karma: Name and occupation. Lotta: I-I declare! What in tarnation!? Hey, Judge! This here is violence against my fair self! Judge: That's fine. Lotta: \"That's fine!?\" That ain't fine!! That's a whip! Eaaah! von Karma: There's no need for foolish outcries from foolishly foolish fools. Just hurry up and testify about what happened on the day of the murder. Lotta: I haven't even gotten to say my name and job yet... von Karma: ... Lotta: The name's Lotta Hart, paranormal photographer, and I'm here to testify! Judge: Now, now, let's all be one big happy family... OK...? Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- Lotta: Only the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber. We were waitin' outside the door and then, \"bang!\" we hear this gunshot! Mr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room. Inside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around. I swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room. Judge: And did you take a picture of the scene right after the murder took place? Lotta: Reckon course! Phoenix: Eh? ...Excuse me? Lotta: Reckon course! It's short for \"Ya reckon!? Of course I did!\" Aah! von Karma: Does it look like I care? Just hurry up and show your picture to the court. Phoenix: (The moment of truth. What will be in that picture?) Lotta: Umm, let's see here... This here's the picture! Judge: Hmm... It would certainly seem that only the defendant and the victim were in that room. Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: Are you ready, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (I will clear all doubt about Maya through this cross-examination... Just watch me!) Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- Lotta: Only the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was it really only those two that went in!? von Karma: von Karma: What are you blabbering about!? You were there too, were you not!? Phoenix: Urk. von Karma: Why don't you answer that yourself? Was it really just the two of them? Phoenix: ...Yes. Dr. Grey and Maya were the only two who went into the room... Judge: H-Hold on! We can't have the defense testifying against its own client! Lotta: Anyway, folks, only the two of 'em went into the Channelin' Chamber, ya hear? von Karma: But you knew that from the very beginning, didn't you? ...Witness, continue. Lotta: We were waitin' outside the door and then, \"bang!\" we hear this gunshot! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was it really a gunshot!? von Karma: von Karma: Are you insane!? You must have heard it as well! Phoenix: Urk. von Karma: Why don't you testify for the court, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Was it really a gunshot? Phoenix: ...Yes. I think it was something that sounded like a gunshot... Judge: And why are we here listening to the defense testify!? Phoenix: (...And the world becomes just a little crueler...) Lotta: I heard a gunshot a long time ago, so I know. And I tell ya that was a gunshot I heard. Now, this -- this is where the story heats up! Lotta: Mr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, let me get this straight! This \"Mr. Lawyer there\" broke the door down!? von Karma: Honestly, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Why don't you tell us what happened, then? Phoenix: Um... Yes, Ms. von Karma... I broke the door down. Sorry. (Why does this feel like an inquisition?) Lotta: No need for apologizin'! That was great! You're a real man! Judge: Oh, really? That's something I would've liked to see. Phoenix: (The judge is smiling rather openly. I'll take that as a good sign...) von Karma: And? What did you see once you broke in? Lotta: Inside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure it was the defendant, Maya Fey!? Lotta: Sure, I'm sure! Phoenix: (Lotta seems awful confident in her testimony...) Press harder Phoenix: Lotta! Please, think back to that day one more time. Lotta: Wh-Whatcha getting' at? Phoenix: Remember what you said when we broke into the room...? ???: ...I was... murdered... *klik* Phoenix: Lotta! At a time like this!? Lotta: Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!? Phoenix: When you saw the murderer at that time, you couldn't even tell if it was Maya Fey or not! Am I correct!? Lotta: Ah, um, well, ya see... Judge: Order! Ms. Hart! You are here to present accurate testimony! Lotta: Yeah, ah, s-sorry. Phoenix: (Good. This shifts things back to my side...) von Karma: For a defense lawyer, your defense is terribly lacking, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: ! von Karma: Witness. Think back to when those two entered the Channeling Chamber. Lotta: When they entered...? von Karma: One of those people that entered the chamber was Maya Fey, correct? Lotta: Yeah, that's right! Phoenix: (Yeah... It was Maya that went in.) Judge: Hmm... It looks like we've come to a collective conclusion. The person in this picture is most certainly Maya Fey. von Karma: Exactly. Phoenix: (Rats! And I'm trapped like one... Again!) Leads back to cross-examination Leave her be Phoenix: (Even I can see that any normal person would know who that was. It's no good. I shouldn't push my luck on this...) Leads back to cross-examination Lotta: I swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain of that!? Lotta: Sure am! But that old witch chased us out of the room, so... Phoenix: (\"Old witch\"? Does she mean Morgan Fey?) Lotta: But there was no one else in there, and you know it! Phoenix: (The Channeling Chamber was very dark, almost pitch black... Was there really no one else in there? What about...?) behind the folding screen? Phoenix: What about... behind the folding screen? Did you check back there? Lotta: Reckgiven! Phoenix: Huh? What in the...? Lotta: Reckgiven! Ya know! \"Ya reckon!? That's a given!\" I took me a good look around the room once! There ain't no way anyone was hangin' out behind that foldin' screen! Judge: Hmm... If I may have a word with you, Ms. Hart... Lotta: Wh-What? Ya got a problem!? Judge: Reckgiven!... I mean, I am having a little difficulty in understanding you. If you would stop saying such things as \"Reckongiven\" and so forth... Aah! von Karma: Now then, Mr. Phoenix Wright, do you see a problem with the testimony or don't you? Leads back to cross-examination behind the door? Phoenix: What about... behind the door? Did you check there? Lotta: What do I look like to you? I wasn't born yesterday, ya know! First off, the one that bust that door open was you! With the way ya slammed that door, anyone standin' behind it woulda had more face and less nose, free of charge! von Karma: In any case, there was no one standing behind the door. Phoenix: (She actually had the police investigate that too!?) Leads back to cross-examination under the flooring? Phoenix: What about... under the flooring? Did you check there? Lotta: I ain't no ignoramus to make it out here! Phoenix: Huh?... Wh-What are you talking about? Lotta: Don't \"what are ya talkin' about\" me! Under the floorin'? C'mon!, even a bug wouldn't crawl under that! von Karma: Sorry to disappoint, but there was no secret passageway under the flooring. Phoenix: (Oh... Yeah, that was a bit far-fetched, huh...?) Leads back to cross-examination Phoenix: (Argh! Her story adds up... What's worse, I was there at the scene of the crime with her... (Changed from [What's worse is that I was there at the scene of the crime at that time too,] in the original release) and her story is exactly how I would have told it, too... (Changed from [and her story is exactly how I would have told it...] in the original release)) After pressing all statements: Phoenix: (Argh! Just as I thought, there is nothing wrong with her testimony! I was with her, so I know she's telling the truth...) Judge: Enough. It seems that there are no issues with Ms. Hart's testimony. von Karma: At the time of the crime, only two people were in the Channeling Chamber: the victim, Dr. Turner Grey, and the defendant, Maya Fey. Judge: Hmm... The face of the defendant can not be verified in this picture. However, if we think about the circumstances, it would have to be the defendant. Phoenix: (What am I going to do!? If I just let this go...) Judge: What is it, Mr. Wright? You look as if you have something to say... Phoenix: (If I make one wrong move, I'm going to have the judge against me... Is there anything I can present that would prove it's not Maya in that photo?) Present evidence Phoenix: Your Honor! Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: It is possible that the person in this photo is not the defendant! Judge: Wh-Wh-What!? Do you know what you are proposing!? Lotta: Y-Y-Yeah! That's just plain fool's talk! Phoenix: (Thanks guys. Your show of support was just great...) von Karma: ... Judge: ...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof. Prove to this court that the person in this photo is not Maya Fey! Present anything Phoenix: Phoenix: Here is your proof! von Karma: von Karma: ... Phoenix: Is there a problem? von Karma: Oh, no. I thought I would work on my inflections. Just wondering what an \"Objection!\" with a twist of \"You're wrong!\" sounds like. Judge: Mr. Wright. I'm sorry, but I don't follow your logic. Phoenix: (Shoot. I guess I wasn't showing enough confidence...) Present another piece Leads back to: \"...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof.\" Give up Leads to: \"Well, Mr. Wright?\" Can't present anything yet Leads to: \"Well, Mr. Wright?\" Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Nothing, Your Honor... von Karma: That's very smart of you, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You really should give up trying to prove this is not Maya Fey. Phoenix: (I didn't say anything about giving up! I just don't have the right piece of evidence to prove my argument...) Judge: That's enough! Phoenix: (I-Is this it...? Is this all I could do...?) Judge: I think it is quite obvious to this court that a verdict of not guilty is not possible. von Karma: I told you. Totally, 100% impossible. Judge: Ms. von Karma, do you have any further questions for this witness? von Karma: Having established the defendant's guilt, further questioning won't be needed. Judge: What about the defense? No further questions, I presume? Phoenix: (I... I couldn't protect Maya...) The defense... The defense... ...Phoenix... ...Phoenix, you can't make that kind of face... ...A lawyer is someone who smiles... no matter how bad it gets!... Phoenix: M-Mia! Mia: I guess I made it just in time, wouldn't you say? Phoenix: Y-You... But... P-Pearls! Mia: Her clothes ARE a bit small... Anyway, what are you waiting for, Phoenix!? Let's go! Phoenix: B-But how!? She's already taken away every advantage! Mia: The advantage is still in your hand! Think carefully, one more time, about what you saw in the Channeling Chamber. Do you remember what you told me yesterday? Phoenix: D-Dr. Grey!! *klik* ???: ...I was... murdered... Phoenix: W-What!? *klik* Phoenix: Lotta! At a time like this!? Lotta: Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! Mia: You see... There is one final piece to this puzzle. (Changed from [You see... There is one final piece of the puzzle.] in the original release) Phoenix: Mia...? Mia: Question Lotta one more time, Phoenix. I don't know if she's doing it unconsciously or on purpose, but... (Changed from [I don't know if she's doing it subconsciously or on purpose, but...] in the original release) she's not testifying truthfully. Judge: Now then, this court would like to end the cross-examination period. Phoenix: Phoenix: Please wait, Your Honor! The defense would like to request that the witness testify one more time. Judge: Overruled. I'm afraid you're too late, Mr. Wright. The cross-examination has already ended. Furthermore, any unrelated ques- Aah! von Karma: It's fine. I'll allow another testimony. A Von Karma's case is perfect. Absolutely flawless. And what better time than this for you to see that. Judge: B-But... I mean... I have some place I must go after this... Mmph! A-Al-Alright! I'll allow it! Ms. Hart! Hurry and give us another testimony! Lotta: Well... heck... What am I supposed to talk about? Phoenix: Please tell us once more, what happened when you burst into the Channeling Chamber. Lotta: OK! You got it! Mia: See, you got through to the judge somehow, right? Phoenix: (Well, actually it was Von Karma's whip that got through to him...) Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account, Pt. 2 -- Lotta: When we broke into that room, all I could focus on was Maya. I was... uh, kinda scared of the dead body, so I didn't take a good look at it. I'm really bad when it comes to blood and ghosts and stuff. But I still managed to point my camera at Maya and take a shot! Judge: Nothing sounds different from before... Phoenix: (Some parts of her testimony were very vague. I should press her on those sections!) von Karma: Struggle all you like as you taste the bitterness of your defeat. Well, amuse me with your useless questions, Mr. Phoenix Wright. I'm waiting... Cross Examination -- Witness' Account, Pt.2 -- Lotta: When we broke into that room, all I could focus on was Maya. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, what did she look like? Lotta: Ya know, she looked almost like a different person. Judge: A... A different person? von Karma: She may have seemed like a different person, however, she was still Maya Fey. We have already made that point abundantly clear! Judge: Yes, that is true... Well, then, Ms. Hart. Did you happen to see anything else? Lotta: I was... uh, kinda scared of the dead body, so I didn't take a good look at it. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Then perhaps that body was not Dr. Grey's at all! Lotta: Eh!? W-Well... I reckon that's possible... von Karma: von Karma: If the body inside that room was not that of Dr. Grey, then whose body was it, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: Well, what if it was that of Maya Fey after the channeling? Or maybe -- Oww! von Karma: Foolish fool spouting foolish foolishness, just as I expect of a foolish fool such as you. If that were the case, then that would mean that Maya Fey is, in fact, dead. And that would make the defendant's chair quite a lonely place, wouldn't it!? Phoenix: (Urk... Sorry, Maya...) Lotta: Are y'all done here? Can I continue? Lotta: I'm really bad when it comes to blood and ghosts and stuff. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And even knowing that, you still persist in being a paranormal photographer? Lotta: That's why I'm getting out of this here business. This gal's gonna get the dirt on the stars and be a tabloid photographer from now on! Phoenix: (She goes through jobs faster than a baby through diapers.) Wah! von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright. Would it kill you to stay on topic for a change? Judge: Well? Would it, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (Nice, tag-teamed in stereo. Guess I should be grateful it's not in 5.1...) Lotta: But I still managed to point my camera at Maya and take a shot! Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"Two, right?\" Mia: There must be something we can use in her testimony just now. We must find it! At all costs... Phoenix: Two, right? Lotta: T-Two what? Phoenix: Two shots. You took two shots. Judge: But... Only one has been submitted as evidence! Phoenix: Ms. Hart! Where is the other picture you have been withholding!? Lotta: No, no, no! You've got it all wrong! It's not me! I-I didn't mean anything bad! I know I can be a little mean, but I ain't evil! Phoenix: (Well, at least she knows herself...) Judge: Then why have you not shown this \"other picture\" to this court yet? Lotta: Well, ain't it obvious!? That prosecutor woman told me to shut my trap about it! Phoenix: W-What!? V... Von Karma!! Judge: M-M-Ms. von Karma! Y-Y-You... You're hiding critical evidence...! von Karma: ... Phoenix: (Unforgivable, von Karma. Suppressing evidence like this... You're as bad as your father!) Confront Franziska Phoenix: Your Honor! The defense asks that Prosecutor von Karma be held in contempt of court! Judge: Hmm... Well, yes... Mngh! von Karma: Me? In contempt of court!? You can't be serious. Phoenix: But... But you hid evidence from the court... On purpose! That's... That's... That's not fair! Mia: P-Phoenix!! Are you a lawyer or a school child? Phoenix: (Ack! I was so angry I lost my composure...) Leads to: \"Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?\" Leave it to the Judge Phoenix: (...Argh! I'm so mad that even my throat's clenching up! I'd better let the Judge handle this...) Leads to: \"Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?\" Judge: Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court? von Karma: I thought this picture was not important, and thus, felt no need to submit it. That's all. Phoenix: H-How could you think...!? von Karma: The pictures were more or less the same, so why bother with the second? I mean, it's just so much more trouble than it's worth for me to submit this as evidence. Phoenix: \"M-More trouble that [sic] it's worth!?\" How... How can you say that!? von Karma: If you want to see it that badly, I'll submit it. Lotta's Photo 2 added to the Court Record. Judge: ... Wh-What is...? What is this picture!? von Karma: It's obviously the second picture the witness took that day at the scene of the crime. Well, it's a little off-center, but that's what you get with a nervous amateur. Judge: Um... I think the important point here is the person in this picture! (Changed from [Well, I think the important point here is the person in this picture!] in the original release) This is most definitely NOT Maya Fey! What is the meaning of this!? Phoenix: (This might be the break I was looking for... Now, should I or should I not insist that the person in this picture is not Maya?) Drop the issue Phoenix: ... (It's no good. We've been through this so many times...) Judge: This is not like you, Mr. Wright! Why are you not objecting!? The person in this photo is clearly not the defendant and yet... von Karma: Ha ha ha... There is no way he can raise an objection and hope to live. Judge: Explain yourself! Leads to: \"Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture.\" Insist it's not Maya Phoenix: Your Honor! As you can plainly see, the person in the picture is not Maya Fey! Judge: Y-Yes, I see that... It's not just her face! Her whole body has taken on a different appearance! Phoenix: There is only one conclusion that can be drawn, then. That somehow, this other person snuck in and traded places with the defendant! Judge: Order! Order! Order!! Well, yes, I believe you are correct, Mr. Wright! The person who was inside the Channeling Chamber was not Maya Fey! Phoenix: Mia! We did it! Mia: ...You're too soft. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: You're softer than Aunt Morgan's strawberry desserts, Phoenix. Take a look at Prosecutor von Karma's face. Phoenix: (S-She's... smiling...!?) von Karma: I think you had better continue to worry, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Judge: M-Ms. von Karma! What do you mean by that? Leads to: \"Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture.\" von Karma: Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture. This was taken yesterday at the Detention Center's Visitor's Room. This is Mr. Phoenix Wright and the defendant, Maya Fey during his visit... Judge: Maya Fey? But... Isn't this a totally different person!? von Karma: She looks this way because she is obviously in the middle of channeling a spirit! Judge: It's unbelievable... That she can... von Karma: Yet, it is the truth. (Changed from [However, it is true.] in the original release) When Maya Fey is in that state, she physically changes into the person she's calling! Judge: ... Mia: Ms. von Karma. A word, if I may. (Changed from [I wonder if she knows what she's doing...] in the original release) Phoenix: (M-Mia!?) (Question mark not present in the original release) Mia: Taking pictures of someone during a private visit is illegal. Surely, you must know that that picture can't be submitted as evidence. (Changed from [That picture can't be submitted as evidence.] in the original release) von Karma: ... Obviously, I know this picture is illegal. (Changed from [Obviously, this picture is illegal.] in the original release) But I never intended to submit it as evidence in the first place! Phoenix: (Wh-What is she...?) von Karma: From the moment I showed this picture to the court, this case became all mine. After all, this image has now been forever burned into the judge's mind. Judge: ... Phoenix: (I... I don't have even a single witty line...) Mia: It looks like we've been had. Judge: I don't claim to understand this, and I still cannot believe it... Are you saying that this person... this person is the defendant, Maya Fey!? Phoenix: (If I give up here, the trial will end! But... If I slip up and say something wrong, it will cost me... Is there any way I can prove that the person in this picture is not Maya!?) I can't prove it. Phoenix: (It's no good! My argument doesn't hold any water!) Judge: I see the defense is staying silent on this one. Phoenix: ...Yes... Your Honor... von Karma: And to think. I even gave you this chance to prove your point for free. But you couldn't even point yourself out in a line-up! Judge: Hmm... Yes... Well, then. I believe we have reached a conclusion. Mia: Phoenix! Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: You can't give up! Please, for me? Take a look at the Court Record again and try to find some way out of this jam! Phoenix: Yeah... Some way... Mia: The judge is about to close the trial. You can't let that happen! Phoenix: (Argh... It's come down to this!) Your Honor! Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now. Judge: What is it, now, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Please! Please let me explain! Leads to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" I can prove it. Phoenix: Your Honor! Judge: Oh! The fire has returned to your eyes, I see. Phoenix: This picture... Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now. Judge: A contradiction!? Leads to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" von Karma: So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep. Why don't you point out exactly what is so strange in this picture for the court? Present bottom of cuff on left sleeve Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please direct your attention here!\" Present face Phoenix: Phoenix: Please direct your attention here! Judge: ...T-To her... face? Phoenix: With your own two eyes, you can clearly see that this face does not belong to Maya Fey! von Karma: von Karma: Fool! Do you even know what you're talking about anymore!? Phoenix: AAAH! THAT HURT! von Karma: Didn't we just finish discussing that her appearance changes during channeling!? Lotta: I know you ain't no dummy, so don't think yer foolin' no one here! Judge: There is a limit to everything, Mr. Wright. And that includes patience! Mia: Phoenix! You have to think before you speak! You can't just blurt out any old thing. Maya: ...Nick! You're supposed to be helping me! Phoenix: (*cringe* Even Maya's mad at me now... I have to focus!) Leads back to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: The contradiction lies... Here! Judge: ...You don't sound very sure of yourself, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Excuse me, but can you really tell me how much confidence I have in this!? von Karma: Hmph! What is with that attitude!? Phoenix: AAAH! THAT HURT! von Karma: Didn't we just finish discussing that her appearance changes during channeling!? Lotta: I know you ain't no dummy, so don't think yer foolin' no one here! Judge: There is a limit to everything, Mr. Wright. And that includes patience! Mia: Phoenix! You have to think before you speak! You can't just blurt out any old thing. Maya: ...Nick! You're supposed to be helping me! Phoenix: (*cringe* Even Maya's mad at me now... I have to focus!) Leads back to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" Phoenix: Please direct your attention here! Judge: ...T-To the sleeve? But... But there isn't anything odd about it... Phoenix: And that is exactly what is so odd. Something that should be there is suddenly missing. von Karma: \"Should be there\"...? Aaaaah! Phoenix: There was a bullet hole in the sleeve of the defendant's costume! If that's the case, then it should be in this picture as well! Judge: Ms. von Karma!! Y-You... You intended to hide this valuable piece of evidence!? von Karma: ... Judge: You will most certainly be assigned a penalty for this! Phoenix: (Alright. This should do some major damage to her argument...) Mia: Don't celebrate yet. Phoenix: You like to bring down the mood, don't you? Mia: Take a look at Ms. von Karma's face. Phoenix: (Argh! She's got that condescending grin plastered all over her face again.) von Karma: ...Tsk, tsk, jumping the gun again, I see. Your Honor! I would like to extend an apology on behalf of those incompetent fools. Judge: Wh-What do you mean? And what \"incompetent fools\"...? von Karma: If those fools down at the precinct hadn't missed the bullet hole, I would have gotten a report about it. As I didn't, I could not have known that this picture was of any value to this case. Judge: Hmm, I see... Phoenix: (She's lying through her teeth! I know it! That woman knew about everything! The bullet hole, the picture -- everything!) Mia: But you can't prove that. Franziska von Karma's idea of a \"perfect case\" is quite fascinating, don't you think? von Karma: Your Honor. You need not worry. If you must assign a penalty, I'll personally make sure that detective gets what's coming. I'm sure there will be a great gnashing of teeth at the next salary discussion. Phoenix: (Poor Gumshoe...) Judge: In any case, this is a very big problem! When the defendant was taken into custody, her costume had a bullet hole in its sleeve. However, from this photo, it would appear that right after the shooting, there was none! von Karma: ... Mia: The judge is confused by this strange twist of events. This is your chance, Phoenix! Load all you've got into this one shot, alright!? Phoenix: Got it! (Watch this, Maya!) Your Honor! There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction! This picture is a fake. Phoenix: The fact that the defendant's costume has a bullet hole in its sleeve is a fact! Which can only mean one thing. That this picture is a fake! Judge: Wh-What!? Lotta: Hey! You callin' me a forger now!? Phoenix: Well, no, not you exactly... Well, not per se... Lotta: Oh no ya don't! Don't you be scratchin' yer head with that goofy smile like some monkey! Now, why do ya think I'd do somethin' that nasty!? C'mon now! Mia: Phoenix! Use your brain for a change! Phoenix: S-Sorry, Chief... Leads back to: \"There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!\" The bullet hole was made later. Phoenix: There is only one explanation for why there is no hole in the sleeve in the picture! The hole was created much later, after the murder took place! Judge: A-After the murder!? Lotta: Hey! Those two gunshots we heard were before we broke in, or did ya forget!? Phoenix: Hmm... I-Is that how it went? von Karma: The pistol fired only two shots. No more, no less. Judge: You do know how to count, right? Mia: Phoenix! What are you doing!? Try it one more time! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Chief... Leads back to: \"There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!\" The shooter is someone else. Leads to: \"The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it.\" Phoenix: The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it. However, this person clearly does not. There can be only one explanation. The person who shot Dr. Grey was not the defendant, but a different person altogether! von Karma: Wha-Whaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! If order is not restored, I will suspend this trial! Oww! Phoenix: Aah! Lotta: Why me!? von Karma: The defense's... The defense's argument is a complete mess! Phoenix: A complete mess? I fail to see how! Please, enlighten us. von Karma: Hey, witness! Lotta: Aah! What the heck!? Is that any way to ask a gal a favor!? von Karma: Be quiet you! You were the one who said it was only the two of them when you entered the room! Lotta: Well, ya know... von Karma: If you were lying, I swear that my whip will be the last thing you see! Lotta: L-Look, sis... You're lookin' mighty scary so why don't we say you... Waah! I-I swear! I wasn't lyin' or nothin'! There wasn't anyone else in there! Honest! von Karma: You see! Now riddle me this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Where did the defendant vanish to!? And where did this other woman appear from!? Phoenix: Umm... (Why is it lately, all I want to do is cry...?) Judge: Well, if the person in this picture is not the defendant, then this poses 2 very big questions. First, where did the defendant vanish to, and second, where did this person come from? von Karma: That's right! Now hurry up and answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Mia: Come on! You can't fall apart here, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (I can't believe that even Mia's calling me by my full name... But... I mean... How am I supposed to prove something like this!?) von Karma: Had enough yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Or do you think you have enough in you to turn things around even now!? Phoenix: (To \"turn things around\"... That's right. Mia would always turn things around and change her perspective!) Mia: Phoenix...? Phoenix: (So, where did this intruder appear from, and where did Maya disappear to? I need to look at this situation from a different angle! Let's see... What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room... And what if Maya had left that room somehow... If I could prove that either one of those conditions were true...) Judge: Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you've come up with. Phoenix: I think what happened before we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber is... a 3rd person had entered it. Phoenix: Your Honor! I would like to present some evidence! I have proof that there was someone else in the room before the murder took place! Present anything Phoenix: Phoenix: Please take a good look at this! Judge: ...Okay... von Karma: I've already seen it. Phoenix: Thank you. Judge: And? What is the purpose of this item? Phoenix: Don't you see, Your Honor? von Karma: I don't think you actually see what you are doing. Phoenix: ... *sigh* Judge: I think it is the court that should be sighing at you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ouch, that stung...) Present another piece Leads back to: \"Your Honor! I would like to present some evidence!\" Think it over again Phoenix: (I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...) Leads back to: \"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\" Maya had left the room. Phoenix: Maya had left the Channeling Chamber at some point! And the defense can prove this! von Karma: Oh, how a foolish fool makes a foolish face while dreaming foolishly foolish dreams. Maya Fey was being looked after by her aunt, Morgan Fey. The chances of her leaving the crime scene is lower than that detective's salary! Judge: Anyway, let's see some evidence. Prove that from the murder until the time of arrest, the defendant had left the room. Present Black Key Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key?\" Present anything else Phoenix: The evidence you're looking for is... this? Judge: ... Lotta: Why the heck is there a \"?\" at the end there for!? Phoenix: Well, actually, I'm not really sure about this evidence, you know...? Judge: Next time, only present evidence you actually do have faith in. Phoenix: (Oww... That burned...) Present another piece Leads back to: \"Anyway, let's see some evidence.\" Think it over again Phoenix: (I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...) Leads back to: \"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\" something I can't explain yet. Phoenix: I'm sorry, but I simply can't. von Karma: Y-You see!? And the reason is quite simple. Because there is no explanation. That's why! Judge: Hmm... As I thought. Another big waste of this court's time. Mia: Phoenix! You can't just give up like that! Phoenix: But Mia! Mia: Rethink things one more time! There has to be an explanation! von Karma: I'm already \"perfect\". So of course, my conclusions are also \"perfect\". Phoenix: (Grr... Alright, Wright. Calm down and let's try this one more time!) Leads back to: \"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\" Phoenix: Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key? Lotta: Um... Well, I've seen it... Hey! That's the Channeling Chamber key, right? Before the channeling started, Maya locked the door from the inside with that... von Karma: The defendant herself locked the door...? Lotta: Yeah! That's why we all couldn't get the door open. That key's the only one of its kind, after all. Judge: Oh... One of a kind, you say? von Karma: ...! Wait... Mr. Phoenix Wright... Phoenix: Yes? (It looks like she's catching on...) von Karma: I'm afraid to ask, but... Why is that key currently in your possession? Judge: Huh? What do you mean? Phoenix: If Maya Fey locked herself in, then the key should have been with her. Judge: Yes, agreed. Phoenix: However, she did not have the key at the time of her arrest! Lotta: Aah! Well, ain't that a kick! So how come you're holdin' it!? Phoenix: I got this as a present from a certain little girl. And that little girl was nowhere near the crime scene at the time! von Karma: Th-Th-That's preposterous! Phoenix: This means that Maya Fey must have left the room! If she had not, then I would not be holding this key you see before you! von Karma: N-Nooooooo! Judge: It seems we have come to an impasse. This picture has clearly captured the face of the murderer. However, is this person the defendant or not? The defense is arguing that this person is not the defendant. Furthermore, as proof, this key has been submitted as evidence. Ms. von Karma. von Karma: How. Can. This. Be!? Judge: At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant's guilt is not possible. (Changed from [At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant is not possible.] in the original release) von Karma: My perfect case! How is there a flaw in my perfect case! Don't think you've won yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright! I am a prodigy! I have never lost a case! And I don't intend to lose here in this courtroom to a fool like you! I don't care what I have to do... I will get my guilty verdict! Judge: That's enough! If you would like to continue, do so in the lobby. Court will reconvene tomorrow at 10 AM. That is all. Court is adjourned. June 21, 1:32 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Maya: Woooow! That was you Pearly!? You summoned my sis!? Pearl: Yes. I felt I had no choice... Maya: Great going, Pearly! I knew you were special! Hey, Nick, did you know? Phoenix: (...Umm, yeah. It's not like anyone else in there could have done that.) Maya: Hmm, Nick... I know you're trying really hard and all, but... I really don't remember ever leaving that room. Pearl: And I don't think that a third person... could have gone into that room. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Well, at least we have until tomorrow to figure things out. Like, what happened in that room, for instance. Maya: Yeah. I'm counting on you! Pearl: Ah... I envy the two of you... Maya: Oh, by the way, Nick. Do you think you could take Pearly back home for me? Phoenix: Sure. Alright, Pearls. You ready to go buy some tickets? Pearl: Huh? A tik-ket? Phoenix: (Poor thing... So sheltered.) To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maya Fey... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned! Reunion, and Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 June 21, 3:24 PMKurain Village Pearl: Thank you very much for bringing me home, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: You're welcome. I had to come and look into a few things here today anyway. Pearl: Um... I thought about this a little. Phoenix: ? Pearl: If Mystic Maya didn't kill that nice man... Phoenix: She definitely didn't! Pearl: Yes, of course. But if she didn't... Then someone else did, right? Um, that \"murderer\" person! Phoenix: Yes, Pearls. Pearl: Oh... I see... Phoenix: (I wonder what's wrong... She seems sad...) Examine Phone booth Phoenix: It's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. I called the police from this phone. Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So, what did you think of seeing your first trial? Pearl: I was really surprised! I had never seen so many people before! Phoenix: O-Oh... Pearl: And Mystic Maya looked so small... and helpless. Phoenix: (Well, Maya's already naturally short, so...) Pearl: And then, that snobby woman with the ruffly clothes... Phoenix: (Ruffly... Oh, she means Franziska...) Pearl: She had such a bad attitude! She acted like she had already decided that Mystic Maya did it... I am going to tell her what I think of her tomorrow! Phoenix: (I wouldn't miss tomorrow's trial for the world...) Prosecutors (appears after \"Today's trial\") Pearl: Why was that woman bullying Mystic Maya? Phoenix: Well, she's the opposite of a lawyer -- a prosecutor, so her job is to prove people guilty. They don't care if someone's innocent. All they care about is if they win. Pearl: Th-That's terrible! B-But... She's really a good prosecutor with a heart on the inside, right? Phoenix: ... There's no one like that. All prosecutors are the same. ... Well, \"he\" might have become a good guy... Eventually... Pearl: \"He\"? Who are you talking about, Mr. Nick? Is it that person Mystic Maya was talking about? Mr. Eh-ji-werth...? Phoenix: ...That was a long time ago. He's not around anymore... Pearl: Huh? Phoenix: He clutched onto his foolish pride too fiercely... and died for it. Pearl: O-Oh... That's too bad... The murderer Phoenix: By the way... Pearl: Yes? What is it? Phoenix: Um, you wouldn't happen to know anything about who the murderer is... would you? Pearl: Wh-Why are you asking me!? Phoenix: No, I was just thinking earlier... Pearl: I didn't see anything! Phoenix: (She \"didn't see anything\", huh...? Speaking of that... During the murder... where was Pearls, and what was she doing...? And on top of that... This key... Just when did she pick this up...?) Pearl's alibi (appears after \"The murderer\") Phoenix: I just realized that I never asked you what you were doing at the time of the crime. Pearl: ...? Phoenix: Pearls, where were you and what were you doing when the murder happened? Pearl: Ah...! Phoenix: ...? Pearl: Wh-What I-I w-was doing? Ah, I-I w-wasn't d-doing a-anything! Phoenix: (She's really bad at lying...) You can whisper it to me. I won't tell anyone else. I promise. 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: Aah! Pearl: ... Um... I guess you can see through my lie, huh? Phoenix: Yeah... Clearly. Pearl: I can't lie to you, can I, Mr. Nick? Pearl's alibi (subsequent times) Phoenix: You really won't tell me what you were doing at the time of the murder...? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I'm sorry... Phoenix: But with the Magatama, I can unlock your Psyche-Locks, right? Pearl: Yes... Ah, what should I do...? Should I tell you what my secret is...? Phoenix: (If you would just tell me, it would be easier for the both of us...) Pearl: I'm so nervous... Phoenix: (Pearls is holding the key to this whole case! I can feel it! ...Speaking of keys, this one turned out to be quite important too... I didn't think it would literally be the \"key\" to today's trial.) Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: So... that's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure? Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: I feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama... Phoenix: (Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...) Folding Screen Pearl: So you like things about spirit channeling too? The Kurain Sacred Writings are on this folding screen. Phoenix: Oh? Is that what's written on it? Pearl: There are six lines to the Sacred Writings. Cleanse thy soul... Open the door to the spiritual realm beyond... Converse with the departed... ... Cast on thyself Protection... Maintain the spell... Release the spell... Phoenix: (So basically, this has nothing to do with the murder... Well, that's super.) Black Key Phoenix: About this key, Pearls... You found it on the day of the murder, right? Pearl: Yes. Phoenix: Now, where you found this key is very important. So, please tell me, Pearls. Where did you find this? Pearl: Um... I found it in the incinerator... Phoenix: The incinerator? (Hmm, is she talking about the one in the garden?) Pearl: The door on it was a little open, so I took a peek... Phoenix: When was that? Pearl: It was after the channeling, when everyone was in a panic. Phoenix: Hmm... Pearl: Um... Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ...? Yes? Pearl: Are you going to tell my mother? Phoenix: Huh? You mean, tell Morgan what you did? Pearl: Yes. If she finds out that I was playing in the left-over trash, I'll get a spanking. Phoenix: ...Ah, gotcha. Well, let's keep it a secret from her then, alright? (Hmm, the incinerator, huh? Sounds like a good place to search next...) Knife Pearl: I've seen this knife before. Phoenix: Really!? Where!? Pearl: M-My kitchen... Phoenix: (Oh... That's right... This knife belongs to the Feys...) Pearl: I'll skin and cut up some apples for you later, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: O-OK... Thanks. Maya's Costume Pearl: Th-That's Mystic Maya's! Phoenix: (Ack!! I shouldn't have shown her something this violent...) Pearl: I-I-Is that... Blood!? Phoenix: Umm... It's nothing. Really. Just forget your ever saw this, okay? (What was I thinking? I can't show stuff like this to a child.) Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Phoenix: (On second thought, showing her this picture might cause severe trauma...) Pearl: ...? Mia Fey profile Pearl: I knew her for a little while. Mystic Mia was your teacher, right? I'm sure she was a great Master of Lawyers. Phoenix: (\"Master of Lawyers\"... I guess...? I mean, it's not exactly a martial art...) Pearl: You should keep training, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're probably right. Pearl Fey profile Pearl: To tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me. Phoenix: I think your hair now suits you perfectly. Pearl: R-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget* Phoenix: *fidget, fidget* Franziska von Karma profile Pearl: Ah! This person! I can't let her get away with bullying Mystic Maya like that! I'm going to cast a curse on her! Phoenix: C-Can spirit mediums really do that...? Pearl: ... Actually, no, I guess not... Grr... I have to find something I can do, then! Phoenix: (When they're mad, the women of the Fey family could give Medusa a run for her money...) June 21Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: This case has had me out of the office most of the time... I can come back tomorrow. Helping Maya should be my top priority now. Examine Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's a handful but I've grown quite attached to the little fella. He also helps me to remember all the good times with Mia. June 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (Maya must still be in questioning... She'll probably be done in a little bit, so I'll come back later...) June 21Fey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: (It's really empty... There's supposed to be training held today, but I guess it's already over...) Examine Door Phoenix: A door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. But I guess it wasn't strong enough to withstand The Phoenix! June 21Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: (...Hmm, looks like Morgan's here too, but she hasn't noticed me yet... What is she doing...? She looks like she's talking to a picture...) Morgan: ...Don't you see? Take a look around... Finally, my chance has come... I've waited for this day for so long! That's right... Prepare yourself, dear Misty... Phoenix: (What in the...!?) Morgan: Who's there!? ...Oh, if it isn't Mr. Wright... Phoenix: Um... Just curious, but that picture you were just looking at... Morgan: Oh, today was that event, was it not, good sir? I heard you did well. Phoenix: Huh, oh, yes... Thank you. Morgan: I am terribly sorry I could not attend the trial today. Please accept my apology. I had a previous engagement, as I had to watch over the trainees' training today. Phoenix: (I get the sense she really doesn't want to talk about the picture...) Morgan: All because the Master can't be here with us, you understand. And that is why a lowly branch family member such as myself must do this. Examine Space behind folding screen Phoenix: There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. There wasn't anyone back here at the time of the murder... Or that's what Lotta testified in court... (I knew I should've taken a look... I can always count on Lotta to make things hard...) Talk What happened Phoenix: Have you remembered anything about the murder? (Changed from [Have you remembered something about the murder?] in the original release) Morgan: No, I told you everything I know already. Phoenix: Were you in this room the whole time when Lotta and I went to call the police? (Changed from [Where [sic] you in this room the whole time when Lotta and I went to call the police?] in the original release) Morgan: Yes, of course. I was by Mystic Maya's side the entire time. I performed the Spirit Severing Technique and held her in my arms afterward. Phoenix: Hmm, you said that yesterday as well. Did anything else happen? Morgan: I would like to say more did, however that is all that occurred. Phoenix: (Ah, I was really hoping for some new info...) Morgan: I suppose nothing happened in the end, good sir. Sorry to have played on your hopes. Phoenix: (Could you possibly be more patronizing...?) (Chnaged from [Why do I feel like I was just made fun of in the worse way possible...?] in the original release) Training Phoenix: So do the students train every day? Morgan: Yes, absolutely. They were given a day off the day after the murder, of course, however... Phoenix: And I assume both Maya and Pearls went through this training...? Morgan: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ack! Yes, yes! (Wow, she got real scary, real fast...) Morgan: How many times must I tell you before you understand, good sir? They are to be addressed as Mystic Maya and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: S-Sorry... I meant Mystic Maya and Mystic Pearl... Wait... I'm sorry, but \"Mystic\" Pearl? Isn't that going a bit too far...? Morgan: Next question, please. Phoenix: (Oh man... She's really being a pain in the butt about this...) Morgan: Please remember to watch not only what you say, but how you say it, good sir. The Master Phoenix: So the Master is... um, Maya's mother, right? Morgan: ...Mystic Misty... She is a brilliant medium. Phoenix: And where is she now...? Morgan: We are not sure. Phoenix: Not sure? Morgan: About 16 or 17 years ago, Mystic Misty failed at channeling a certain spirit. And after that... she simply disappeared. Phoenix: ... Morgan: I don't believe she will return to this village, in any case. And in four years' time, her name will be forever erased from this village. Phoenix: ...Erased? Morgan: A person who has been away from the village for over 20 years is considered dead... Phoenix: Oh, I see. Morgan: And that is four years from now for her. When that happens, a new Master will be appointed to Kurain Village. Phoenix: And...? Morgan: Mystic Maya was supposed to become the next Master... However with this... murder, I'm afraid... Phoenix: (I must be imagining things... I thought she was laughing to herself for a second there...) Present Folding Screen Morgan: There are six parts to the Kurain Sacred Writings. To think that this valued treasure of our village... and Mystic Maya were both shot by a gun... Phoenix: Well, that's... Morgan: Even if it was something that occured during a channeling, it is an unforgivable act. Black Key Morgan: This... This is the key to this room! Phoenix: That's right. Morgan: B-But why do you have it, good sir!? Phoenix: That, I'm not telling. Morgan: R-Return it at once! Phoenix: I... I can't. It's evidence, after all. (I think she knows exactly how important this key is to this murder... But what is this feeling I'm getting from her? It feels... Hmm... I can't describe it.) Maya's Costume Morgan: That is Mystic Maya's costume, isn't it...? It's a shame. I never thought anything like that would happen to her... Phoenix: But we don't know that it was Maya that did it... Morgan: Oh, poor Mystic Maya. Phoenix: (Do you ever listen to anyone other than yourself?) Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Morgan: That is Mystic Maya before I applied the Spirit Severing Technique... This picture... It was taken without my express permission. I knew allowing a person like her from the \"Heartland\" into our country was a bad idea. Phoenix: (You do realize that the \"Heartland\" is a part of this country, right...?) Turner Grey profile Phoenix: About this person... Morgan: Oh! It is that man, is it not? A man who wishes to borrow a departed spirit's power to hide the lack of his own. What an insignificant man. And see how pitifully he died. Phoenix: Insignificant...? Morgan: That would mean you are that man's insignificant little friend, dear sir. Phoenix: (Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?) Mia Fey profile Morgan: ...Oh, my... I think I may know of this person from somewhere... Phoenix: It's Mia. You know, Maya's older sister? Morgan: ...! Aah! Yes, that is who she is... Phoenix: (...How could you forget a daughter of the Master...!?) Morgan: If memory serves, she became a lawyer. Oh, how splendid for her, don't you think? Phoenix: (That soft, kind smile... It's the kind that tells you a pair of devil horns are not too far away...) Pearl Fey profile Morgan: Come to think of it, I don't believe I have seen my child today. Would you happen to know where she is, good sir? Phoenix: N-No, I wouldn't. Morgan: Honestly! Take one day off from training, and it is neigh impossible to make it up. Good sir! I pray you are not teaching her strange, fiendish things in her time off! Phoenix: (Oh boy. Here comes her anger. ...And we were having such a civil conversation too...) Morgan Fey profile Morgan: Being born as one of the Fey family, but of weak spiritual power... It makes the people of this village look down upon you, you know? Phoenix: I-I didn't know that... Morgan: But I will be alright. ...As long as I have Pearl. I am satisfied because I have my Pearl. Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this? Morgan: I am terribly sorry, but I am afraid my spiritual powers are not as strong as you might think... I really am terribly sorry. Phoenix: (Um, but this has nothing to do with your spiritual power...) June 21Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Looks like there's no one here... And even though the weather is gorgeous today, it's raining inside my heart...) Examine Side Room entrance Phoenix: That's the \"Side Room\". Looks like guests can use it as a place to take a break when they feel tired. Urn Phoenix: It's a really old urn. There are the ashes of a person long dead inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on. June 21Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: (The bedding is all laid out today too. Guess I'll leave them alone for now...) Examine Sliding door Phoenix: It's still charming to see a real sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard. Bed on right Phoenix: ...Excuse me... ... (Who am I talking to? There's no one here.) Yellow box Phoenix: Hmm, I keep wondering about this box. I'm sure this wasn't here before the murder took place. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom. After presenting Black Key in Kurain Village: June 21Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Hey, there's someone by the incinerator... Ooh, looks like they've noticed me. And are now running at top speed towards me...) Ini: Oh, hey! *huff, huff* Like, *huff, huff* You're that dentist guy. Phoenix: Actually, it's Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. Nice to see you again. Ini: Ooh, like, real suave. So, it's, like, my turn. It's nice to see you, too. Phoenix: So, what's up? You're all out of breath... Ini: L-Like, huh? Oh! Like you mean... Like, I'm just totally happy and like, totally excited to be here. Phoenix: Excited? Ini: Like, I mean, there are so many things to, like, see! It's, like, the real deal here! Phoenix: Oh, really? For example...? Ini: For example... Like, that urn over there. Do you, like, know about it? Phoenix: (All I see is an old, cracked piece of pottery...) Examine Incinerator Phoenix: That's right... Pearls said she found this key inside the incinerator. I guess I should take a look inside for myself... ... Th-This... This is from Maya's costume...! There's blood on it... A tiny bit, but still... Cloth Scrap added to the Court Record. Incinerator (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, this piece of cloth was burned in this incinerator. And this key was also found in there. Hmm, I get the feeling this incinerator plays a crucial part in this murder... Urn (after clearing \"Sacred Urn\" Talk option) Phoenix: So there's a spirit in this urn, huh? Hmm, all I see are a bunch of cracks. But I guess maybe the spirit could live in the space between the cracks... Hmm, looks like something's written on it... \"I AM\"? Huh? Weird... Sacred Urn added to the Court Record. Urn (subsequent times) Phoenix: So there's a spirit in this urn, huh? Hmm, all I see are a bunch of cracks. But I guess maybe the spirit could live in the space between the cracks... Hmm, looks like something's written on it... \"I AM\"? Huh? Weird... Talk Sacred urn Phoenix: Is there some sort of legend connected with that urn? Ini: Like, yeah! It's, like, this village's treasure! Phoenix: Huh. Didn't know that. Ini: And, like, it's sealed inside that urn. Phoenix: ...Um... \"It's\"...? What are you talking about? Ini: Like, you know! Ami Fey's spirit! Phoenix: Ami... Fey...? Who's that? Ini: Like, jeez, Mr. Smith. Get with the program! Everyone knows the lady that founded the Kurain Channeling Technique was Mystic Ami. Phoenix: Um, you don't have to get upset with me... Ini: So, like, as long as her spirit, like, lives in that urn, the spiritual power of the Fey family'll stick around. Like, isn't that totally romantic? Phoenix: Umm... Romantic, huh...? (If that urn is really as important as she says, it could be a vital clue...) What happened Phoenix: Ini, I want to ask you about the murder... Ini: Murder...? Phoenix: Dr. Grey's... Remember...? (As if there's another one?) Ini: Oh, that one! Like, you shoulda said so in the first place! So, like, I totally don't know anything 'cause I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room. Phoenix: Well, that's not much help... Did you notice anything at all? Ini: Like, come on. What a total bore. I, like, totally have nothing to do with this, like, murder thing... Phoenix: (Oh, yeah. You only introduced Dr. Grey to Kurain Village. No relation, sure. Even if you were only \"acquaintances\", that still means you knew him. Furthermore, your sister, who died in that accident, was a nurse at his clinic...) Ini: ... Traffic accident (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Alright then. Why don't you tell me about your sister's fatal accident. Ini: ... Like, why? You think, like, it's got something to, like, do with the murder? Phoenix: I don't know yet, but I'm trying to chase down every lead I can... (Changed from [I don't know yet, but I'm trying to chase down every lead I have...] in the original release) 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Psy... Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [...A... A Psyche-Lock!] in the original release) Ini: Like, what is it? Phoenix: (Looks like I'm going to need something to pry her mouth open on this one...) Traffic accident (subsequent times) Phoenix: Um, about the accident, Ini... 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Ini: Like, you're totally not gonna give up, are you? Phoenix: No, I'm not. Ini: I totally want to forget about my sister, you know? Time to move on and all that. Phoenix: (Guess I have no choice but to remove those locks...) Present Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Ini: Wow, so, like, the Kurain technique is the real deal. I'm gonna, like, have to write about it in, like, my report for school. Hey, so, like, you'll give me this picture for, like, the report, right? Phoenix: No way! Maya Fey profile Ini: She's, like, in a lot of trouble, huh? Phoenix: (She's stealing quick glances at the picture while smiling like a cheshire cat...) Ini: But, like, this will totally prove the power of channeling. Phoenix: (...\"This\"? What \"this\" is she talking about...?) Pearl Fey profile Ini: Like, that's totally Mystic Maya's cousin, right? Phoenix: Yes. Her name is Pearl. Ini: Hmm? So, like, this little kid is, like, the next Master...? Phoenix: Oh, no, no, no. Maya is the next in line to be Master. Ini: Ah, oh yeah. Like, that's right. After clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber, and presenting Black Key in Kurain Village, then examining incinerator in Fey Manor - Winding Way: June 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: Hey, Nick... I've been waiting... Phoenix: (...She looks so helpless...) Maya: So? So? How was it!? What did you find out!? Phoenix: Um... Well... I found a few things... Maya: Is it so bad that you can't even look me in the eye? (Changed from [My eyes are tearing up, Nick. Don't make me cry...] in the original release) Phoenix: I... I just need a little more time. It'll all come together by tomorrow, I promise. Maya: I'm sorry, Nick. Every time I see you, all I do is cause trouble... Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So how was it? Today's trial, I mean... Maya: You were fantastic, Nick! Every time I thought our goose was cooked, you managed to turn it all around. I bet it would make a great Hollywood movie! Phoenix: Don't be silly. We have to concentrate on the trial. We're going to win this, Maya! Maya: ...Thanks a lot. Really. Hey, Nick? The person who shot Dr. Grey wasn't me, was it? Phoenix: Of course not. You're completely innocent. Maya: If that were true, then I'd be really happy, but... there wasn't anyone else in that room with the two of us, right? Phoenix: Well, did you check behind the folding screen? Maya: Um... I took a quick glance, but there wasn't anyone there. Phoenix: Hmm... (That's exactly what Lotta said too...) Not guilty Maya: Um, Nick... Phoenix: Yeah? Maya: Why do you believe in me? Why do you think I didn't kill Dr. Grey? Phoenix: ...Because of something Mia told me. Maya: My sis? What did she tell you? Phoenix: She said that spirit mediums can't have dreams. When you're channeling, it's impossible for you to dream because your soul leaves you. Maya: Now that you mention it... Wait, then... then... I really am...? Phoenix: You are not the real murderer. I think that... maybe before you even called the spirit, you were drugged. Maya: Drugged...? Phoenix: I think this was planned from the very beginning. And you were set up to take the blame for killing Dr. Grey. Maya: That's... That's... Pearl's alibi (appears after clearing \"Pearl's alibi\" Talk option in Kurain Village) Phoenix: I want to ask you something about Pearls. Maya: Pearly? What about her? Phoenix: No matter what I try, she won't answer me. I want to know what she was doing at the time of the murder. Maya: Huh!? (Changed from [Hmm...] in the original release) W-Wait! Nick! Y-You don't think she did it, do you!? Phoenix: No, no, nothing like that... Maya: She'd never do anything like that! You hear me!? Never! She's a great kid, and really cute... And really great... And cute. Phoenix: I didn't really think she was the murderer. But... she's definitely hiding something. Maya: Hmm... Phoenix: You were with her on that day, right? Maya: Yeah. The two of us. We were playing with her ball. Phoenix: A ball, huh? (Sounds like a dead-end to me...) Ball (appears after \"Pearl's alibi\") Phoenix: So, about this ball... Maya: It's nothing really special... Just a plain old ball. I think she was still playing with it when I started the channeling job that day. Pearly really loves to play with that ball. Phoenix: She \"loves to play with that ball\", huh...? Maya: When she wants to get it, she always climbs right into the clothing box. Phoenix: The clothing box? Maya: Yeah. Pearly's always hiding in there. You know the Side Room? There's a clothing box in there. It's really big, so once you see it, I'm sure you'll know what I'm talking about. Phoenix: (The clothing box in the Side Room, huh?) Present Attorney's Badge Maya: It's the same as the last time I saw it. You just like to show it off, don't you, Nick? Are you that thrilled to be a lawyer? Phoenix: Th-That's not what I meant by it, but... I mean, I don't really think about it. I just sort of shove it in people's faces... Force of habit, I guess. Folding screen Maya: That hole... It looks an awful lot like a bullet hole... Phoenix: That's probably what it is. Maya: That's TERRIBLE! How could this happen to such an important screen!? Phoenix: ... Um, instead of dwelling on the hole, let's focus on the fact that you weren't shot... Maya: ... Hey, you're right! So I was the one who was about to get shot, huh? Th-That's TERRIBLE! Who'd want to shoot little ol' me!? Phoenix: (I guess she didn't realize she was the one being shot at until now...) Black Key Maya: Ah! That's... The Channeling Chamber's... Phoenix: This is the only one in the world, right? Maya: Yeah. During the trial, I was kinda wondering why you had it... Phoenix: I got it from Pearls. Maya: That's weird... I swear I locked the door... and then put the key into one of my pouchy sleeves... Phoenix: Your sleeve? But how and when would your sleeve leave the room? It didn't grow a pair of legs... Maya: I wonder where Pearly found that key... Knife Maya: That's a knife from my family's kitchen. I'll never be able to use it again... Phoenix: It's alright. I'll buy you a new one, OK? Maya: Argh! That's not the point! ...I don't ever want to see another knife... ever again... Maya's Costume Maya: That... That's... That's mine, isn't it? Phoenix: (Dammit! I upset her again...) Maya: It really was me, wasn't it? Wasn't it, Nick? Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Maya: This... This is me, right? I guess I really did shoot Dr. Grey... Phoenix: But that's not you! Maya: Is too! Phoenix: Is not! Maya: Is too, is too! Phoenix: (I should've kept this picture to myself...) Sacred Urn Maya: That's Kurain's Sacred Urn. Mystic Ami's soul is sealed inside of it. Phoenix: Yeah, I know all about it. About how she's the founder of the Kurain Technique. Maya: Ooh, look at Mr. Smarty here! Thinks he knows all! You sound like an occult fanatic. Phoenix: (...Trust me, this isn't going on my resume any time soon...) Maya: You know, I haven't looked at this in a long time. I wonder when it became so cracked? Cloth Scrap Maya: ...What is it? Phoenix: I'm not too sure myself, but I found it just now inside the furnace. Maya: Huh? Is it trash burning day already? Phoenix: That's not something I would know about... (I guess she didn't notice the bloodstain. Probably better that way...) Mia Fey profile Maya: What am I supposed to do, sis!? ... Pearl Fey profile Maya: Pearly... She definitely has more than me... Phoenix: Huh? What are you talking about? Maya: Who I think the next Master should be... I mean, she's got more spiritual power than me, and she really works hard at her training... Phoenix: (Way to go Phoenix... Way to bring the mood down even further... *sigh*) Franziska von Karma profile Maya: So she's Prosecutor von Karma's daughter, huh? Phoenix: Looks like it. Maya: Well, then... she'd know about that person, right? Phoenix: (\"That person\"...? Is she talking about \"him\"?) It's alright. We don't need to talk about that right now... Maya: ... Ami Fey profile Maya: ...Mystic Ami. She's a Legendary Spirit Medium. I like the way that word sounds... \"Legendary\"... Ever since I was young, I've dreamed of being a \"Legend\". Phoenix: (Well, this murder will make you into a \"legend\", alright... Hmm... I probably shouldn't say that last thought out loud...) Any other evidence Maya: Um, I can't think of anything special about it... After clearing \"Ball\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: June 21Kurain Village Phoenix: Ah! Lotta: AAAAAAAAH! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait! Please! Lotta! ... (She ran off into the manor...) June 21Fey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: Lotta... Lotta: Aaack! Phoenix: H-Hey! I'm tellin' ya, quit followin' me, ya hear!? I'm a worthless piece of trash! Ya lay eyes on me, and they'll turn ta dust! Phoenix: (...*sigh*...) Channeling Chamber Phoenix: Hey! Morgan! Morgan: Yes, what is it? ...And must you be so noisy!? We have a rule here: \"The hallway is not for running\" Now then, in a calm manner ask your question. Phoenix: Okay... Anyway, did you see Lotta come by here? Morgan: Ah, that girl from the \"Heartland\"... I'm sorry, but she did not pass by here at any time. Phoenix: (Grr... Lotta! You sure know how to waste a man's time...) June 21Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: I'm pretty sure I saw Lotta run in this direction... but it doesn't look like she's here... Examine Ball Phoenix: It's Pearl's ball. Maya said that it's always kept in the clothing box... So then, what is it doing on the floor...? Pearl's Ball taken. Clothing box Phoenix: It's the clothing box where Pearl's ball is usually kept. I wonder what's inside... Aaaaah! Phoenix: Whaaaa!? Wh-Wh-What were you doing in there!? What were you thinking!? Lotta: I'm a bad person! Just another piece of human trash. I needed a hole to crawl into... Phoenix: ... (So you crawled into this clothing box because there wasn't a hole to crawl into? Oh man... ...Huh?) There's a small hole in this clothing box... And it's about... 8 inches off the ground! That's the same height as the hole in the folding screen! Then, could this...? Clothing Box added to the Court Record. Clothing box (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's the clothing box where Pearls keeps her ball. I thought I felt my soul shake when Lotta jumped out at me. So it's big enough to fit a grown adult... Well, if she can be called an adult... June 21Fey ManorMeditation Room Pearl: Oh, Mr. Nick! That person ran by here just now. Phoenix: What person? Pearl: Um, you know... The person with the fluffy cotton candy hair... Phoenix: (Ah, she means Lotta.) Pearl: She said, \"Don't look at me with 'em eyes!\" but... I'm not that scary, am I...? Phoenix: ...I don't think that's quite what she meant. Pearl: Oh, that's right. She also wanted me to tell you, \"Goin' on a trip to find myself, so don't ya bother findin' me!\" Phoenix: O-Oh... Well, thanks. Pearl: You're welcome. Talk Pearl's alibi (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: Around when Mystic Maya started the channeling on that day, I was playing in the Winding Way... with my ball. Phoenix: And that's when you... broke the urn? Pearl: Y-Yes... I broke it... I... I accidentally let Mystic Ami's spirit fly away! Phoenix: Don't worry. Morgan will never know, OK? Pearl: I'm a bad child... Breaking a village treasure is unforgivable. I thought... that maybe they would make me leave the village. But the broken pieces were pretty big, so... Phoenix: You thought you could put them back together, and no one would notice? Pearl: ...Yes. Sacred Urn (appears after \"Pearl's alibi\") Pearl: I found some glue and brought it to the hallway... and fixed the urn there. Phoenix: The hallway? You mean \"Winding Way\"? Pearl: Yes. The channeling had already started, so I didn't think anyone would walk by. Phoenix: Hmm, I see... So, about how long did it take you? It must have been a nasty repair job. Pearl: Yes. I might be strong at spiritual things, but when it comes to arts and crafts, I am not nearly as skilled. When I had finished fixing the urn and looked up, I saw you coming into the manor... Phoenix: (So that's around when Lotta and I were coming back inside after reporting the murder.) Pearl: When I saw that, I packed everything up in a hurry. Um... Mr. Nick? Phoenix: What is it, Pearls? Pearl: I'm... I'm going to get banished, aren't I? Phoenix: I really don't think that's going to happen. I mean, I bet Mystic Ami's happy to be free from that cramped urn. Pearl: Y-Yeah, I hope so... Phoenix: (No harm done, and a happy resolution... Phew!) Sacred Urn updated in the Court Record. Sacred Urn (appears after \"Pearl's alibi\") Pearl: I found some glue and brought it to the hallway... and fixed the urn there. Phoenix: The hallway? You mean \"Winding Way\"? Pearl: Yes. The channeling had already started, so I didn't think anyone would walk by. Phoenix: Hmm, I see... So, about how long did it take you? It must have been a nasty repair job. Pearl: Yes.

I mean, I bet Mystic Ami's happy to be free from that cramped urn. Pearl: Y-Yeah, I hope so... Phoenix: (No harm done, and a happy resolution... Phew!) Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Pearl's Alibi -- Phoenix: Pearl. You have to tell me what you were doing when the murder happened, OK? Pearl: Um... But what if I can't just tell you what happened...? Phoenix: Then I'll guess what happened. How does that sound? Pearl: What!? Y-You can do that? (Changed from [Eh!? Y-You can do that?] in the original release) Phoenix: You'll tell me if I guess something right, won't you? Pearl: ...Y-Yes... Phoenix: Now, when the murder was taking place, you were here, right? Present Winding Way Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were here, weren't you Pearls -- in the Winding Way?\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: I'm pretty smart, Pearls. I know you were right here. Pearl: No, I wasn't... Phoenix: Huh? I'm wrong? Pearl: Ooh, I feel a little better. Phoenix: (Ooh, I feel a little warmer... from embarrassment. ...I'd better try again...) Leads back to: \"Now, when the murder was taking place, you were here, right?\" Phoenix: You were here, weren't you Pearls -- in the Winding Way? Pearl: W-Wow! ...Y-You got it. Phoenix: So? Do you think you can tell me now? Pearl: ...I'm sorry... Not yet... Phoenix: Man, oh man... Alright, what next...? OK, I think I know what you were doing there. Pearl: D-Do you really know that much? Phoenix: Well, I am a lawyer, you know. Now, what was it Pearls was doing in the Winding Way? Present Pearl's Ball Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were... playing with this ball, right?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... Phoenix: So? Pearl: I feel just a little better. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: You are a lawyer, but you're also still a person, after all... Phoenix: Sorry, I'll get it right this time... Leads back to: \"OK, I think I know what you were doing there.\" Phoenix: You were... playing with this ball, right? Pearl: Ah! That's right! How... How did you know...? 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Maya told me that you love to play with your ball. Pearl: Um... Yeah. I was playing with my ball. Phoenix: Un, huh. And then? Pearl: ... Phoenix: Something happened, huh? ...Something really bad... Pearl: *gulp!* Wh-What do you mean, \"something\"!? N-N-Nothing happened...! Phoenix: This is it. While you were playing with your ball, this happened! Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Leads to: \"This urn... It's a village treasure, right?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... Phoenix: Were you so surprised that you were shocked into silence? Pearl: ...Yes, at how wrong you are, even though you were so sure of yourself... Phoenix: ...Huh? (Way to embarrass yourself in front of an 8 year old, Wright...) Ah, sorry, sorry. Just see if you were paying attention... Ah heh heh. Pearl: It's okay Mr. Nick. You can always try again. Leads back to: \"This is it.\" Phoenix: This urn... It's a village treasure, right? Pearl: Ah... Um... Phoenix: And the spirit of the founder of the Kurain technique is sealed in here, isn't it? Pearl: ...Y-Yes... Phoenix: What's this? It's cracked all over, isn't it? There's even a few gaps here and there... Pearl: Um... Please don't tease me... Phoenix: Pearl, you broke the Sacred Urn, didn't you? Pearl: ...! Phoenix: The ball smacked into it and knocked it over, right? And if Morgan found out, she'd get really mad, huh? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (She doesn't seem to be fighting back... I think I hit the bull's-eye this time. But it's strange that the lock hasn't broken yet...) Pearl: I-It's... It's a really old urn, isn't it? Phoenix: I-I guess? (Changed from [Eh?] in the original release) Pearl: I-I-It's so old... So it's not that weird... to have a few cracks... Phoenix: (Her voice is shaking...) Pearl: H-How can you tell that urn has been broken!? Present Ami Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Who started the Kurain Channeling Technique?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ...I'm sorry. I don't want to be mean, but... Phoenix: (*sigh* I figured...) Pearl: Um, do you want to try again? Phoenix: Yeah. (I'm sure I can get it if I think about it some more! The thing I'm missing... must have something to do with what's written on the urn...) Leads back to: \"H-How can you tell that urn has been broken!?\" Phoenix: Who started the Kurain Channeling Technique? Pearl: Huh? (Changed from [Eh?] in the original release) Oh, um, it was Mystic Ami... (Changed from [Um, it was Mystic Ami...] in the original release) Phoenix: That's right. And how do you spell her name? Do you know? Pearl: How do I spell her name? Um... I don't know... Phoenix: It's spelled \"A-M-I\". Pearl: *gasp!* Phoenix: I thought it was a little odd when I saw \"I AM\" written on this urn. Pearl: ... Phoenix: And that's how I knew that someone must have broken this urn. And made a mistake in spelling when they put it back together again... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful After examining the \"Clothing box\"  in Fey Manor - Side Room and adding it to the Court Record: June 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: M-Mia! Mia: Phoenix, it's good to see you. I was really worried so I thought I'd see how you were doing. Phoenix: ...You might get caught on film again... Mia: There are certain risks you have to take in life, or in my case, death. Anyway, how are you doing? Have you found anything useful? Phoenix: Um, only a little. I think I'm slowly beginning to understand everything, piece by piece. Mia: Everything will resolve itself by tomorrow, somehow. Talk Tomorrow's trial Mia: There's still a whole slew of questions for you to answer before the trial tomorrow. Phoenix: You mean like how did the real murderer get into the room and kill Dr. Grey...? Mia: Yes. Also, when did the murderer enter the Channeling Chamber...? You guys were all standing around in front of the room after the channeling started. Phoenix: Which means that the murderer must have gone into that room before the channeling... Mia: That's what I think, in any case. Phoenix: But Maya's already said there wasn't anyone else in there. Mia: ...That's true... But if we can't figure out the murderer's movements, we're stuck like a beached whale. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Kurain Channeling Technique Mia: I thought I'd never see this day. Are you actually asking me about spirit channeling? Phoenix: This case is all about spirit channeling. And I feel like I don't understand a thing about it... Mia: Well, that's only natural... After all, spirit channeling isn't exactly an everyday thing, is it? Phoenix: Yeah, I guess you're right. Mia: The power to change your physical appearance into the person you're calling was something our ancestor, Mystic Ami Fey acquired. Phoenix: I've heard that name before... Mia: The Fey family was originally a family known for its service to the gods. When Mystic Ami was born, she was given a certain fate through her name. Because, you see, she was named after one of the Buddhas of Buddhism, \"Amitábha\". To this day, her soul is still sealed in the Kurain Sacred Urn. It usually sits in the Winding Way, and has her name written on it. Phoenix: Um, yeah... Mia: Aww, come on, Phoenix. It's just a fairy-tale. Phoenix: (Are you saying that me being able to see you is just a fairy-tale too...?) Present Anything Mia: Come on, Phoenix. We don't have time to be looking at things like this. We need to find out everything we can for the trial tomorrow. After clearing all Talk options: Mia: Well, it's about time I left. Phoenix: M-Mia! Mia: We'll be in big trouble if the guard sees me here... Phoenix... Phoenix: Yes, Chief! Mia: There is still a lot of dirt left in this case. Once you think you've gathered all the evidence, then come back. Phoenix: ...Yes, Chief. After clearing \"Sacred Urn\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Meditation Room: June 21Kurain Village Phoenix: (Phew. I think I've found everything I can. But I can't see how it all adds up... Hmm... (Changed from [But I can't see how they all add up... Hmm...] in the original release)) ...H... He... Phoenix: (And is Ini Miney being here just a coincidence...?) ...Hey, Mister... Phoenix: (How is it that the spirit Dr. Grey wanted to call just happened to be that nurse, and that nurse turns out to be Ini's sister... It's too... convenient...) ...Hey! Phoenix! I'm talkin' to you! Phoenix: (I wish I knew a little more about Ini, but where am I going to find info like that?) Oh, I get it. Ya can't be bothered to look over at trash like me. Is that it, Mr. High-and-Mighty!? Phoenix: Aah! L-Lotta! Lotta: Oh, so ya finally noticed! Phoenix: (I thought I heard a mosquito buzzing in my ear, although I couldn't understand a word...) Lotta: Well, I gotta hand it to ya. Ya sure know how to chase down garbage! I mean, I'm grateful to ya for chasin' this large lump of one around like this. Phoenix: Um... Thanks...? Lotta: But ya know, you're just wastin' yer time. I'll be fine on my own. Phoenix: Wh-What are you going on about? And as for \"following\" or \"chasing\" or whatever it is, isn't that what YOU'RE doing!? Lotta: Um, well, ya see... Well, yer not exactly a real gentleman with a lady's heart, are ya? Phoenix: (You're not exactly the world's number one charmer either, sister.) Talk Today's trial Lotta: Look, I'm really dang sorry about today! When I get all fired up about somethin', it's impossible to stop me. Phoenix: You hurt Maya really badly, Lotta. Lotta: Um... I don't suppose you could forgive a gal like me...? Forgive her Phoenix: Well, I guess. You did help Maya out too, after all. Lotta: For real? Phoenix: Yeah, for real. Lotta: Ah, thank goodness... I'm still... Phoenix: \"I'm still...\" what...? Lotta: N-No, no, nothing, nothing at all. Just talkin' to myself, ya know, gibberish... ...Now then! Lotta Hart, at your service! Phoenix: ? Lotta: I'll share with ya all the dirt I've dug up!

Leads back to Talk options Don't forgive her Phoenix: I'm not done... Lotta: Um... Phoenix: And to think we trusted you, Lotta, and what do you do!? You stab us in the back! You stressed us all out and even gave Maya a few strands of white hair! Lotta: Urngh... Phoenix: Now I'm going to have to pray she makes it, or she may come back as a ghost... Lotta: Ack! That's enough! Ya can stop right there! Look, I'll tell ya everything I know! Everything! I'll spill it all! Phoenix: Everything? Lotta: Yeah, ya got it! Everything! But... Well, actually...

Phoenix: You mean Ini Miney? Lotta: Well, there ain't anyone else it could be, right? That granny, you and me, we were all together that whole time... Phoenix: (So, Lotta suspects Ini... Which means she might have already found some info about our mysterious Ini...) Ini Miney (appears after \"Today's trial\" and presenting Ini Miney profile) Phoenix: Speaking of Ini, do you have any other information about her? Lotta: Sure. Phoenix: Well, what is it!? Lotta: Ha ha ha... It'll cost ya... And it'll cost a lot! Phoenix: (Oh, silly me. Here I thought \"free\" meant \"no money necessary\".) Lotta: That girl was hospitalized about half a year ago. Phoenix: Hospitalized...? But why? Lotta: Well, heck, you can go find out on yer own. Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: Here, I'll give ya the clinic's address. Maybe ya can find out something. Phoenix: \"Maybe\"...? What's that supposed to mean!? Lotta: Well... See, actually, it was gonna be annoying, I reckoned, so I didn't actually go there. Phoenix: Aargh... Lotta: Well, that's the way the gumbo spoils, right? Phoenix: Spoiled gumbo sounds... Eww... I mean, look, don't blame this on... Oh, never mind! (Looks like I don't have much of a choice. Better go check out this \"Hotti Clinic\"...) Present Newspaper Clipping 1 or Newspaper Clipping 2 Phoenix: About this clipping... Lotta: Now, you listen here, boy, and listen good. You can't go lookin' at such an old piece of paper, ya hear!? People's got eyes on the front side. You know why? So they can see in front of themselves! Not behind! So how about it? You feelin' my energy? Phoenix: (Nope, not an electron.) Pistol Lotta: Ya think I could have the guts to carry one of these around? A celebrity photographer with a gun? Ya think it'd work? \"Bang, bang!!\" ...Nah... Thanks, but nah. I can't see myself like that. Knife or Maya's Costume Lotta: Aaaaah! Th-There's... There's blood on it!! Get that away from me! Where do you get off showin' somethin' like this to me!? Phoenix: (Oops, guess that was the wrong thing to show her...) Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Lotta: I'm a real natural, aren't I? I caught the murder just right, and even managed to make it mysterious. Phoenix: Mysterious!? All you managed to do was forget to focus your lens! Lotta: Shaddup! That's my technique! My technique, now, ya hear!? Turner Grey profile Lotta: Hey, it's that Dr. Grey guy. It's a pity what happened to him. Pretty scary what ghouls and ghosts can do to a man, huh? Gawd rest his poor soul. Phoenix: (Hmm... Since when was Lotta so religious...?) Maya Fey profile Lotta: Now, this kid -- I think she needs to be taught some manners. This here's her second time in the stew, right? My Pa woulda slapped me straight! Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Lotta: Ya know what they say, if there's a second time, there's bound to be a third, and a fo- OW! Nngh... Ya didn't have to slap me. I get it, I get it. Sorry... Pearl Fey profile Lotta: Hmm... I overlooked this little kid. Phoenix: Wh-What do you mean? Lotta: I mean, I didn't think it, but ya know how it's always 'em silent types? Phoenix: H-Huh!? Wait, wait, wait... Lotta: The little tyke's nothin' but a ball of happy goodness, right? So I reckon, she's the type to have done it! Well, now, that's just how the world turns. Phoenix: I don't think this has anything to do with how the world turns... Morgan Fey profile Lotta: That old lady sure can be forceful. She scared me that day. ...Well, only a little, now, ya hear? Ini Miney profile Lotta: Heh, that's Ini Miney, right? Phoenix: Yeah. I was wondering if you know anything about this girl... Lotta: Ya know! Actually, I did a little checkin' up on her the other day. Her sister, she's the one that Dr. Grey wanted to call back from the spirit world. Phoenix: Yeah, I had heard as much... I had also heard that Ini was the one to introduce Dr. Grey to Kurain Village. Lotta: Ya don't say? That's one sneaky gal, if you ask me... Hey, ya want me to tell ya more about her? Lotta Hart profile Lotta: Ya know, I'm beginnin' to get sick of this hairstyle. Next time I go to the salon, I'm gonna get my hair straightened, I reckon. What do ya think, Phoenix? Phoenix: I think if you got rid of your afro, I wouldn't recognize who you were. Lotta: Yeah, that's kinda the problem, ain't it? Phoenix: (Please, can we get on with the important stuff...? Say, like the murderer...) Franziska von Karma profile Lotta: Hey, this is that prosecutor gal. The one that likes breakin' all the rules. Switches are for horses and lights, not people! How's that? I made a pretty clever pun, didn't I? Phoenix: ...Sorry, didn't hear you. Lotta: Ah, well, I'll forgive the wax in yer ears this once and tell it to ya one more time.

So what can I help you with? Uh, huh... Phoenix: I'd like to ask you a few questions about Ms. Ini Miney. Hotti: Hmm? Ms. Miney? Ms. Ini Miney? ...Hmm... Yes... Hmm... OH! Her! Ah, it's too bad. I'll tell you something. That girl left here a long time ago. Nurse: Here you are! Sir! Phoenix: ? Nurse: You know you shouldn't be up and about! Come on, it's back to your room with you! Hotti: Ah, Sweet'ums! Calm down, calm down. Don't be so harsh to an old man like me. Nurse: Don't you dare start that \"Sweet'ums\" thing with me! If you don't behave, you'll get yourself tossed out of this hospital! Phoenix: (Wow. I didn't think nurses could be this direct or forceful towards their boss.) Nurse: Come now. Be a good boy and give me the Director's white lab coat! Hotti: OK, OK. I got it. I. Got. It. Hmm, yes... Phoenix: ... Hotti: ... Phoenix: Um... Hotti: Hmm, yes? Uh, huh?

Only person I can talk to... ...is this guy... ...Uuuugh...) Examine Waiting room on left Phoenix: This must be the waiting area. It's got the feeling of one and there are sofas lined up... but I don't see all that many patients. Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, it's the quality, not quantity that counts. Uh huh... Phoenix: (What in the world did that have to do with anything...?) Door at end of hallway Phoenix: (I wonder where that door way down there leads to...?) Hotti: Oh, that's the X-ray room. Hmm, yes... Phoenix: H-H-How did you know what I was thinking!? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, it's... Because that's the X-ray room... Uh huh, yes... Phoenix: (There is something very peculiar about this guy...

Reception area Phoenix: This is the clinic's reception desk, but it doesn't look like there's anyone at the counter. On the wall is this month's \"Word to the Wise: Do something in vain, and your only reward is tiredness.\" Hmm, not exactly the best thing to be telling your patients, is it? Talk Hotti Clinic Phoenix: So, what exactly do you treat at this clinic...? Hotti: Hmm, yes... We treat all sorts of... doctory, clinical stuff, uh, huh, yes... Phoenix: D-Doctory, clinical stuff?

There's a really big general hospital around the corner. Hmm, yes... When they can't accommodate everyone, they move some of their patients here. Uh, huh. Phoenix: You do surgeries here, right? Hotti: Hmm, yes... We do some plastic surgery here, it seems... Hmm... Phoenix: It... seems? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Uh, huh... It seems that way. Ini Miney Phoenix: What do you know about Ms. Ini Miney? Hotti: Now you're talking! Hmm, yes. That girl, she was transferred from the general hospital. Phoenix: From the general hospital...? To here? What kind of surgery did she need? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, she needed surgery. It was really bad. Really bad. Phoenix: So what kind was it...? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well... No, no... You see, that is something... No, I can't tell you. Phoenix: (So you say with a happy smile on your face... \"Mr. Director\"...) Hotti: See, there's this thing about how doctors aren't allowed to talk about patient stuff. It's in all those TV shows too, right? You've seen them, right? Hmm, yes? Phoenix: (I'm never going to get him to unzip those broken zipper teeth of his at this rate... There's got to be something I can show to this old coot...) Ini Miney (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about Ini Miney. Hotti: Hmm, yes... I'll get to that, trust me, I will. That girl... That's right. She was transferred here from the general hospital. This was... hmm, yes... a year ago. She was one of those... \"emergency\" cases. Phoenix: What was she ill with? Hotti: Ill? Nah, nah, nah. She was injured, not ill. With my trained eye, I could see. Yep, I could see it was a huge wound at that. Phoenix: A huge injury? Hotti: Her whole body was wrapped around and 'round in bandages and her arm was in a cast. Phoenix: That sounds... pretty severe, alright... Hotti: Hmm, yes... It was an accident; an accident. They're scary, yes? Cars, hmm, yes... Phoenix: Car...? ...You mean it was a traffic accident? Hotti: Yep! That's what gave her the terrible injuries. I swore it was in the papers, hmm... Yes, I looked it all up, I did. It was terrible... Hmm, yes... Phoenix: (...Dare I even ask what is wrong with this old guy...?) The operation (appears after \"Ini Miney\") Phoenix: Just now... You mentioned something about a big operation? Hotti: Hmm? Are you talking about Miss Ini's operation? Phoenix: Y-Yes... Miss Ini's. Hotti: That... Ah, that was one heck of an accident. Hmm, yes... Her whole face was burned like bad toast. It was bad. Very bad. Phoenix: Was it really that bad...? Hotti: Hmm, it was a good thing that Miss Ini had a picture of herself. I heard that picture was how they put her face back together... Hmm... Phoenix: Picture...? Hotti: That girl, see, she had, uh... She had just gotten her license. So she just happened to have a license photo on her, hmm, yes... Phoenix: Oh. Hotti: So, see, I got her picture. As a way to remember her, yes... Well, more like... Swiped...

But I bet I could learn about how to stay on a lead from this guy.) Ah, here we go, here we go... Hmm, yes... Hotti: According to this, Miss Ini was in the passenger's seat. Phoenix: The passenger's seat, huh? Hotti: And dozing... Or so it says. A strong jolt woke her up, and the next minute, a sea of fire was all around her. Miss Ini fought with the door, finally got it to open, and somehow managed to get away. ...Anywhoo, you can read all the details in the article. Hmm, yes...

Is that right...? ...Well, you know, I think I can let you in on a little secret... Phoenix: What's that? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Actually, ... I'm not the real Director. Phoenix: Are you kidding!?

So earlier, that ol' granny called the cops. Phoenix: ...Huh? The cops? Why would Morgan call the police? Lotta: She said she had \"somethin' to tell 'em\". Things are sure gettin' interestin'. Talk Morgan Lotta: Ah, but honestly, I tell ya, that granny sure got her bloomers in a knot. Phoenix: Well, I guess you could put it that way... Lotta: It always starts out small, ya know? Stealin' the Master's seat, and controllin' the village folk... and now ya see what it's turned into? A murder, that's what. Phoenix: Yeah, what a mess. ... H-Hey, hold on! Lotta: What? Phoenix: That stuff you were just talking about... That's the first I've heard of it. Lotta: Heh, really? Well, it's old news to everyone else in the world. Phoenix: (Well, excuse me for not keeping up with gossip while I'm busy saving people!) Phoenix: You said something about \"stealing the Master's seat\"? Lotta: Yup. Right now, the Master is this medium named Misty Fey, but... the one that was really supposed to be the Master was that old granny. Phoenix: (Morgan was supposed to become... the Master...?) Ini Miney Phoenix: Do you know where Ini is, Lotta? Lotta: Yeah, I saw her not too long ago. She's hangin' around that garden in the middle. Phoenix: OK, thanks. Lotta: Ya got somethin' to ask her? Phoenix: (Yeah. I've got a whole list of things only she can clear up for me...) The Master (appears after \"Morgan\") Lotta: So I hear the Master has always been the oldest daughter. Phoenix: The oldest daughter...? Lotta: Turns out, that old bat is Misty Fey's older sister... Phoenix: O-Oh? Lotta: They say the older sister is usually the one with more spiritual power. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Maya said the same thing a long time ago... She warned me not to take Mia's powers lightly...) Lotta: Well, anyway... somehow, granny there lost to her younger sister, Misty. Phoenix: I see... Lotta: This made the townsfolk turn against her, so I hear. Said all sorta things too, like, \"She's the oldest, and yet she doesn't have the power to be the next Master. Disgraceful.\" Phoenix: (Wow. I had no idea...) ...So what would've happened had Morgan been stronger...? Lotta: Maya's family woulda been the branch family, I reckon. June 21Fey ManorWinding Way Ini: Hey!

Anything...! *sigh* I'm terrible at this.] in the original release) Maya Pearl: Mr. Nick, what about... What about Mystic Maya? Phoenix: She'll be alright. I think I've gathered enough evidence... Pearl: Mystic Maya... She must feel all alone. Please, Mr. Nick! Go visit her! Phoenix: Yeah, but... I can't just leave you here all alone, either. Pearl: I-I'll be fine! Please! Mystic Maya needs you by her side! Phoenix: (Her stare is really piercing... *shiver*) Present Anything Phoenix: Hey, Pearls... Could you take a look at... Pearl: ...*sniffle*... Phoenix: (Aww... I can't do this to her now. She looks so pitiful and sad...) June 21, 6:38 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Mia: You kept me waiting, Phoenix. Phoenix: Mia! Mia: So, how are the preparations? Phoenix: I think I have enough evidence and information now... I think... Mia: Everything will be on your shoulders tomorrow. Whether Maya is found guilty or innocent... It's a heavy weight to bear. Phoenix: (Hmm... If memory serves... Mia had a few Psyche-Locks of her own...) Mia. I'm ready to unlock the last piece of information I need now. (Changed from [Mia. I'm going to get the last piece of information I need.] in the original release) Mia: Sure. I welcome you to try. Talk The murderer Phoenix: Mia... Mia: Yes? Phoenix: Mia... You know something, don't you? About the real murderer, I mean. Mia: ...! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Mia: Why... do you think so? Phoenix: (It's really trying at times to be able to see other people's secrets...) Mia: It looks like it's time for you to explain your reasoning. Phoenix: Yeah... (A battle of wits against Mia! ...*gulp*) The murderer (subsequent times) Phoenix: Mia, I want to help Maya any way I can. And to do that, I need to know who the real murderer is... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Mia: I know. Now, show me your ability as a lawyer. Phoenix: (This is it... The real murderer that Mia's been hesitant to name all this time!) The murderer (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"...Something's been bothering me all this time.\" Present Maya's Magatama (after clearing \"The murderer\" Talk option, before Psyche-Locks appear) Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- The Murderer -- Mia: Phoenix... You think I'm hiding information about someone from you... Isn't that right? Phoenix: Yes. Mia: Alright, then. Tell me who you think I'm protecting. Present Morgan Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Morgan Fey, of course.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Um, I think you're trying to protect this person...? Mia: Phoenix. Don't let me down like this. Phoenix: I... I'm sorry. Mia: Maya's life is on the line! Concentrate harder! Phoenix: (Mia's especially strict today...) Mia: So? Have you gathered your thoughts? Leads back to: \"Alright, then. Tell me who you think I'm protecting.\" Phoenix: Morgan Fey, of course. There is no one else you would protect like this, Mia... 1 LOCK BROKEN Mia: Well done, but... While the murder was being committed, my aunt was outside with everyone else. Which means she already has an alibi. Phoenix: That's true... Mia: Show me some evidence that would cast suspicion onto my aunt. Present Black Key Phoenix: Phoenix: My evidence is this black key. Mia: ... Phoenix: At the beginning of the channeling, Maya had possession of this key. And yet, somehow, it magically ended up in the incinerator in the center garden. Mia: ...You're right. Phoenix: There is only one person who could have done that while I was busy calling the police. The person taking care of Maya -- Morgan. Mia: ... Phoenix: What's that look mean? Mia: Your argument is too flimsy. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: When did the key find its way into the incinerator? It could have happened long after the murder happened. Phoenix: Long after...? Mia: Someone could have found the key somewhere and dumped it into the incinerator. Phoenix: But that's... Mia: That prosecutor would use something this small to shred your case. Do you have something other than just the key to cast suspicion on Morgan? Present Cloth Scrap Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is the other piece of evidence that points to Morgan as the culprit.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Mia: Phoenix, we don't have any time left. Phoenix: (I haven't even said anything yet...) Mia: You can't pin my aunt as the murderer with one piece of evidence alone. Leads back to: \"Do you have something other than just the key to cast suspicion on Morgan?\" Phoenix: This is the other piece of evidence that points to Morgan as the culprit. Mia: ... Phoenix: I also found this in the garden incinerator. It's the same material as Maya's costume... Except for the splotch of blood. Mia: But this piece may not even be from Maya's costume. Phoenix: But this is what Maya told me. \"While I was channeling, the key was sitting inside my sleeve.\" And both this key and the piece of cloth were found inside the incinerator. Phoenix: Which means that this piece of cloth was a part of Maya's costume. Mia: But when Maya was arrested, she was wearing her costume. Phoenix: That just means someone changed her clothes. Mia: Changed her clothes? But why...? Phoenix: I don't know why. But... There is only one person who could've done that. Mia: The one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt. 1 LOCK BROKEN Leads to: \"You did very well, Phoenix.\" Present Cloth Scrap Phoenix: Phoenix: The proof is this piece of cloth. Mia: ... Phoenix: I found it in the incinerator near the Winding Way. It's the same material as Maya's costume... Except for the splotch of blood. Mia: You mean, it's from Maya's costume that she was wearing at the time of the murder? Phoenix: Yes. Mia: But when Maya was arrested, she was wearing her costume. Phoenix: That just means someone changed her clothes. Mia: Changed her clothes? But why...? Phoenix: I don't know why. But... There is only one person who could've done that. Mia: The one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt. ... Phoenix: What's that look mean? Mia: Your argument is too flimsy. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: You have no proof that this piece of cloth is actually from Maya's costume. Phoenix: But... this blood... Mia: And do you know whose blood that is at this point in time? You don't, do you? Do you have any proof that piece of cloth is from Maya's costume? Present Black Key Phoenix: Leads to: \"I think this is the proof you're looking for.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Mia: Phoenix, we don't have any time left. Phoenix: (I haven't even said anything yet...) Mia: You can't pin my aunt as the murderer with one piece of evidence alone. Leads back to: \"Do you have any proof that piece of cloth is from Maya's costume?\" Phoenix: I think this is the proof you're looking for. Mia: ...The key to the Channeling Chamber, huh? Phoenix: At the beginning of the channeling, Maya had possession of this key. And yet, somehow, it magically ended up in the incinerator in the center garden. Mia: ...You're right. Phoenix: And this is what Maya told me. \"While I was channeling, the key was sitting inside my sleeve.\" And both this key and the piece of cloth were found inside the incinerator. Phoenix: Which means that this piece of cloth was a part of Maya's costume. Mia: It would certainly seem that way... Phoenix: Someone changed her into a different set of clothes. And then, burned the costume she was wearing in the incinerator. There is only one person who could've done that. Mia: The one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt. Phoenix: Exactly! 1 LOCK BROKEN Leads to: \"You did very well, Phoenix.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Um, I think this...? Mia: No. You're wrong. Try again. Phoenix: You're really unforgiving today, Mia... Mia: And I keep telling you... Don't take this lightly. Maya's life is on the line. Phoenix: (Mia is really serious...) Mia: Now, I'm going to ask you one more time. Leads back to: \"While the murder was being committed, my aunt was outside with everyone else.\" Mia: You did very well, Phoenix. Phoenix: Thank you. Mia: As long as you have those two pieces of evidence, you can cast suspicion on my aunt. However. Phoenix: H-However? Mia: Like I said in the beginning, my aunt has an alibi. Phoenix: Yeah... She was with us the whole time... Mia: Here's my final question. You don't have to present solid proof of this for me. But I want to know. If my aunt is the culprit, then how did she commit the murder? Phoenix: How she did it, huh...? Mia: I want to hear your thoughts. In order for my aunt to murder Dr. Grey, who or what did she need...? Present Ini Miney profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Ini Miney. She's the answer to the final question.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: ... (No idea... Just throwing things out now...) Mia: ...And you were so close too, Phoenix. Phoenix: Yeah... Mia: There is no way my aunt could have done it herself. So, thinking logically, where does that leave you? Should be easy for you to figure out... Phoenix: (So, if Morgan couldn't have done it herself... Then...) Mia: Come on, Phoenix. Think. Leads back to: \"In order for my aunt to murder Dr. Grey, who or what did she need...?\" Phoenix: ...Ini Miney. She's the answer to the final question. Mia: Which means that my aunt and Ini Miney... Phoenix: ...Were in cahoots! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Mia: ...Something's been bothering me all this time. This crime is something no normal person could carry out. The person would have to know a lot about Fey Manor and the village itself to do this. Phoenix: ...But Morgan already has an alibi... Mia: Yes, which is why I can't figure out how it was done. We can assume that Ini Miney is involved somehow... Phoenix: But we have one big problem on our hands. Mia: ...A problem? With what? Phoenix: We don't have a motive. Why would Morgan want to kill Dr. Grey? Why would she have to? Also, we don't really know for sure that she was cooperating with Ini. Mia: ... Phoenix: (Mia doesn't have a clue either, huh?) Mia: Hmm... Then, there is only one possibility... Phoenix: Huh!? Mia: Think about it, Phoenix. Why would my aunt do something like this? And why would she do it in such an underhanded fashion? Phoenix: Um... because...? Mia: Mother... She is the one who holds the key to this. Phoenix: Mother? Whose? Mine? Mia: Don't be silly. Mine, of course! Misty Fey. Phoenix: (Mia and Maya's mother? Why would she bring her up now...?) Mia: Now then... Looks like we've gathered everything we could. All we have to do is win tomorrow! Everything will become apparent then. Phoenix: R-Right, Chief! We won't lose! To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- Maya's Escape --Morgan: After we heard the gunshots, those two broke the door open and entered the Chamber.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Just now, you said, \"those two.\" Who were the two people you were referring to? Morgan: I was referring to that foreign lady and yourself, good sir. Phoenix: Um, Lotta's not a foreigner... despite how she talks... Morgan: Oh, is that so? I'm sorry... I simply could not understand her atrocious English, not to mention she looked awful! Phoenix: (I can already see people in the heartland gearing up for a riot...) Morgan: In any case, I have already sent the repair bill to your office, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Oh, uh, thanks. Judge: Hmm... What did you do after that, Ms. Fey?Morgan: I requested that Mr. Wright and the other lady please contact the police.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was it really necessary to have two people do something so simple as call the police? If there was a possibility of escape, then one of us should have stayed behind! Judge: Hmm, yes. That is a very good point. Morgan: At that time, I, myself, was a little confused. On top of which, there was another... Judge: Another what, madam? Morgan: Oh, it's nothing. No need to concern yourself. Phoenix: (I want to hear the end of that sentence...) Question further Phoenix: There was another reason you wanted both of us out of that room, wasn't there!? Morgan: ... Phoenix: You must testify! Why did you chase us out of the room!? Morgan: ...I simply did not wish for there to be more victims. Phoenix: ...! Morgan: \"The lives of both the good sir and that camera woman may be in danger...\" is what I thought to myself. Judge: Well, that was very noble of you, Ms. Fey. Phoenix: (This is bad... Now people have a good impression of her and a bad one of us...) Mia: Looks like she caught us napping. That's my aunt for you... Judge: Are you satisfied now, Mr. Wright? Ms. Fey, please continue. Leads back to cross-examination Leave her be (before pressing third, fourth, and sixth statements) Phoenix: (The last bit of her sentence sounds like a red herring... If that's the case, I'm not going to fall into her trap today.) Judge: If the defense has no further questions, let us press on. Leads back to cross-examination Leave her be (after pressing third, fourth, and sixth statements) Phoenix: (The last bit of her sentence sounds like a red herring... If that's the case, I'm not going to fall into her trap today.) Leads to: \"That's enough!\"Morgan: A pistol was hanging from Mystic Maya's hand and she was in a daze...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: During our investigation, you stated that you struck the defendant on the head, and this strike caused Maya to lose conciousness. Do you stand by this statement? Morgan: I'm afraid I don't. The statement I gave you was a lie... Phoenix: ...! B-But why would you lie about something like that!? Morgan: It is very painful for me to say this, however... von Karma: von Karma: The witness was lying to cover for the defendant. Phoenix: (She was... covering for Maya...?) Question further Phoenix: So, you were \"covering for the defendant\"!? Morgan: Well, yes... It was only later that I was informed of what had occurred. That the renegade Mystic Maya had done something very unexpected... Judge: S-Something unexpected!? What, pray tell, did sh-- Oogh! von Karma: This witness didn't and couldn't have seen what happened. If you want to know what this unexpected thing was, there is always later. Judge: Y-Yes, very well... Phoenix: (Ugh... Why does it suddenly feel like there's a rock in the pit of my stomach...?) von Karma: Now, witness, continue with what happened. Leads back to cross-examination Leave her be (before pressing second, fourth, and sixth statements) Phoenix: (I'm sure Von Karma's allowing this testimony because it's advantageous to her... ...Which means I shouldn't press Morgan any further...) von Karma: You're finally beginning to understand, aren't you, Mr. Phoenix Wright... Now, witness, continue with what happened. Leads back to cross-examination Leave her be (after pressing second, fourth, and sixth statements) Phoenix: (I'm sure Von Karma's allowing this testimony because it's advantageous to her... ...Which means I shouldn't press Morgan any further...) Leads to: \"That's enough!\"Morgan: Then, quite suddenly, she thrusted me away from herself and escaped from the room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was it really that easy for her to escape from you? Morgan: I'm ashamed to admit to such a thing, however, yes... Phoenix: But you are physically larger and stronger than the defendant. There is no way she could have escaped from you so easily... von Karma: von Karma: Have you forgotten already, Mr. Phoenix Wright? What about this picture!? Remember that at the time, the defendant was not physically \"Maya Fey\". Phoenix: ...Ack! Judge: Hmm... Growing old is such a mysterious thing. Trust me, I know first-hand. Morgan: Basically, Mystic Maya's body was still that of the nurse she had called. Phoenix: But if she had run away, wouldn't you have given chase right away!? Morgan: Well, yes, I would have... however...Morgan: With great strength, she hit the base of my neck and I fainted for a short while...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You fainted...? Morgan: I became dizzy, and then collapsed onto the floor. Judge: How long were you unconscious? Morgan: I... I'm not sure. About ten minutes, perhaps. Judge: Hmm... And the defendant almost certainly went somewhere in that time... von Karma: Happy? Witness, elaborate on that point for us.Morgan: I'm afraid I have no knowledge of where she went after that.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is that because you were unconscious? Morgan: Why, yes... Phoenix: (Great, well, now what...?) Question further Phoenix: So while you were unconscious, you have absolutely no idea where the defendant went? Morgan: I would think that's obvious, good sir. Phoenix: If that's true... then how can you know for sure that the defendant left the Channeling Chamber at all!? Judge: Now that you mention it... I have to wonder myself! von Karma: It's true that this witness is not able to confirm this. But the key word here is \"this\" witness. Phoenix: What do you mean by that!? Mia: It means she has another witness up her sleeve. That's what. It looks like Ms. von Karma is ready to move on to her next witness. Leads back to cross-examination Leave her be (before pressing second, third, and fourth statements) Phoenix: (If she fainted, then there's no way she can testify any more than she has... If I press her, I'm not going to get anything useful anyway...) Judge: Hmm... Well, then... Let's continue on with the testimony, shall we? Leads back to cross-examination Leave her be (after pressing second, third, and fourth statements) Phoenix: (If she fainted, then there's no way she can testify any more than she has... If I press her, I'm not going to get anything useful anyway...) Leads to: \"That's enough!\"Mia: I can't see a crack in her testimony...Phoenix: Wh-What should we do...?Mia: For now, we should try and get more information out of her. After we get more information from her we may be able to use it later to our advantage.After pressing second, third, fourth, and sixth statements:Judge: That's enough! From what I can tell, there is nothing wrong with this witness's testimony. And from what she has said, we can establish that Maya Fey did leave the Chamber.Phoenix: (Hmm... I hope this isn't going to come back and bite us in the butt...)von Karma: Now, let's take the next logical step and ask, \"Where did the defendant go after leaving the Channeling Chamber?\"Judge: Yes, yes... That is exactly what we should b-- Eeek!von Karma: Be quiet, you! Now then, what the escapee had done was she had gone to speak with a certain person!Phoenix: She... She went to speak with someone!?Judge: Wh-Who was it!?von Karma: The prosecution calls Ms. Ini Miney, who was sleeping in the Side Room at the time.Phoenix: I-Ini Miney...?Mia: I think you can see where this is headed...von Karma: Witness. Name and occupation.Ini: Um... OK, so my name is, like, Ini Miney. I'm, like, researching, like, parapsychology stuff at the, um, university.Judge: What is this \"parapsychology\"?Ini: Um... Let's see... It's, like, I guess, most people call it \"occult stuff\".Judge: Even if that's what most people call it, I can't say I understand what that means...von Karma: Then I suggest you go home and research it yourself.Judge: Yes, sir.von Karma: Now then, Ms. Miney, after the murder took place, you spoke with the defendant, Maya Fey. Is this correct?Ini: Um... Well... Hmm... Like, I guess...von Karma: If that's the case, then let's hear your testimony. That IS alright, isn't it, Your Honor?Judge: Yes, sir.Phoenix: (For the love of all things good, Your Honor, have some spine... For my sake...)Witness Testimony-- After the Murder --Ini: Like, when the channeling started, I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room. Like, a little later, someone came into the room, like, really suddenly. It was, like, oh my gawd, totally my sister! I, like, hadn't seen her in like, so long... I was so happy in, like, a sad way... My sister... She, like, told me something, like, totally terrible.Judge: Now hold your horses, young lady! You're saying the person that entered was your sister!? Don't you mean the defendant, Maya Fey...?von Karma: Really, now... Your Honor. Maya Fey was still in the middle of channeling at that time.Judge: A-Are you saying that the spirit was the spirit of this witness's sister!?von Karma: Yes, Mimi Miney. She was a nurse at Dr. Grey's clinic.Judge: Oh... W-Well... This is...von Karma: Witness.Ini: Like, yeah?von Karma: In your testimony, you mentioned a \"terrible\" thing. Why don't you tell the court what this terrible thing was? I'm sure we'd love to hear about it.Ini: ...Um, like... Do I totally, like, really have to?von Karma: Of course.Judge: Ms. Miney... please.Ini: ... My sister... Like, this is what she said to me.That was... no accident... I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini?Judge: She \"took her revenge?\" Are you sure that's what she said?Ini: Y-Yes...von Karma: There, are you satisfied, Your Honor?Judge: ...I still can't believe it. I can't believe that a spirit would go so far as to use a medium to get revenge...von Karma: It is a bit hard to swallow, however, all the evidence and testimonies point to this as the truth! ...The end.Judge: ...What do you think, Mr. Wright? It certainly seems like all the loose ends are accounted for...Phoenix: (This... This testimony just now... Was it all made up? Was it just one huge lie...?)Mia: Of course it was, Phoenix.Phoenix: ...Mia! What do you mean?Mia: It's well constructed... but that's all it is. But even the most well-spun lies can be undone. We can do it, Phoenix. Let's find that one loose thread and unwind this tapestry of lies.Phoenix: Your Honor! There is room for doubt, so the defense will cross-examine this witness. We believe that our cross-examination will reveal the real truth behind this murder!von Karma: Yet again the foolish fool spouts out more foolishly foolish drabble... I wonder if you'll make this one more entertaining than the last...Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- After the Murder --Ini: Like, when the channeling started, I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was that because of your, um... sesame allergy, was it? Ini: Like, that's right. I, like, think there were sesame seeds, like, in the lunch they served that day. I had this, like, premonition that it was going to totally be a \"seedy\" day. von Karma: Yes, indeed. Judge: Hmm... I see... Phoenix: (...Am I the only one who missed the boat here...?) Judge: Anyway, so you were taking a nap. Did something happen while you were sleeping?Ini: Like, a little later, someone came into the room, like, really suddenly.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you know the time? Ini: Um, uh... Like, maybe a little before 11 AM? Something like that, I think... Phoenix: E-Eleven AM...? Ini: Yeah. Like, my stomach is totally ready for, like, food. Phoenix: ... Ah, no... I think you misunderstood me... I'm not asking what time it is now... I meant what time was it when the \"someone\" came into your room! Ini: Oh! So, like, that's what you meant! Like, you shoulda been more, like, clear about it! Phoenix: S-Sorry. My bad. Ini: No, it's OK. Like, it's really... Phoenix: ... Ini: ...? Phoenix: ...That's it? Why'd you stop mid-sentence!? Ini: Did I? ...So, like... what was I talking about again...? Phoenix: ... N-Never mind... von Karma: ...Witness. About this person who entered the Side Room...Ini: It was, like, oh my gawd, totally my sister!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely sure? Ini: ...I guess? Phoenix: You \"guess\"...? Was it or was it not your sister who entered? Ini: Like, I don't know. I mean, like, I totally don't know \"your sister\" at all, Mr. Smith. Phoenix: (First off, my name is not Mr. Smith. Second, I'm an only child. ...Hmm, but more than that, she's managed to mess up the question with her answer...) Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Th-The defense rests... von Karma: Well, that was a colossal waste of our time! Now then, witness. How did you feel when you saw Ms. Mimi Miney?Ini: I, like, hadn't seen her in, like, so long... I was so happy in, like, a sad way...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You were... happy in a sad way...? Ini: Yeah, like, I mean, it was my sister! Phoenix: But wouldn't most people react here with surprise at seeing a dead loved one alive again? Ini: Um, but, like, maybe if I was, like, someone who didn't know about, like, the occult. But I, like, know all about the Kurain Channeling Technique. von Karma: The point here, is the witness immediately recognized that it was her \"sister\". Ini: Yeah, like, what she said. Phoenix: (Hmm... Should I drop this  line of questioning...?) Question further Phoenix: So you really didn't think anything \"strange\" of the whole encounter? Ini: No. Like, there wasn't any reason for me to, like, think anything was \"strange\". Phoenix: But... OWW! von Karma: Don't keep badgering her. Phoenix: ...You know the phrase, \"Objection!\"? Could you try using that once in a while...? Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright. This question of what the witness felt when she saw her sister... is it really that important? Oh, it's nothing. Phoenix: \"Is it really that important?\" Let me ask you: Is it really that important for you to ask? Judge: Of course it's very important. Phoenix: Well, I don't think it's that important at all! Yeow! von Karma: Stop spewing such nonsensical things then. Pay no attention to this twit and continue, witness. Ini: Like, OK. Leads back to cross-examination It is very important. Phoenix: It is very important! (Although I haven't quite figured out what \"it\" is yet. But I've got to bluff for now and make it seem like I know what I'm talking about...) Judge: Alright, Mr. Wright. Ms. Miney, please amend your testimony. Ini: Like, OK. I'm, like, totally cool with that. Changes statement from \"I, like, hadn't seen her in, like, so long... I was so happy in, like, a sad way...\" to \"I wasn't, like, scared at all. And, like, her costume looked totally, like, normal.\" Leave her be Phoenix: (There's no need to press her over something this minor... I should be trying to find a more decisive problem with her testimony...) Ini: So, like, is it OK? I'm going to, like, finish my story, OK? Leads back to cross-examinationIni: I wasn't, like, scared at all. And, like, her costume looked totally, like, normal.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, there was nothing odd at all about your sister's appearance? Ini: Like, yeah. Nothing was, like, weird. Phoenix: (...Hmm...) Mia: ... Phoenix: (Hm? ...Mia's talking to herself like she's found something wrong...) Mia: ...That's impossible... Phoenix: (...?) Ini: Like, is everything OK? Can I, like, go on...?Present Maya's Costume or Lotta's Photo 2 Phoenix: Leads to: \"That was a very well-spun lie, Ms. Ini.\"Ini: My sister... She, like, told me something, like, totally terrible.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Something \"terrible\"? What was this thing she told you? Ini: Huh? Like, didn't I just, like, tell you about it? Did you, like, forget already? von Karma: A foolish fool with a foolish sieve for a brain only speaks foolishly with foolish words. Phoenix: (Well, excuuuse me, Princess. ...Anyway, should I ask to hear the story again...?) Don't bother asking Phoenix: (I did just hear this story. It's not like my memory is that bad...) Actually, the defense is fine and does not need to hear the story again. Judge: Very well. You may continue your testimony, Ms. Miney. Leads back to cross-examination Ask to hear it again Phoenix: I'm sorry, but could I hear the story one more time? Ini: Like, sure, no problem. I'll even, like, tell it all spooky-like for you. That was... no accident... I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini? Ini: ...Like, how was that? Judge: It was a little scary... Ini: Like, I'm sorry. Maybe I, like, put too much spookiness into it...? Leads back to cross-examinationPhoenix: (I know there has to be something here I can use... But where!?)Mia: She really put a lot of thought into this lie, didn't she? We can't rush this. Let's take it slowly, one step at a time. She's bound to slip up somewhere. Don't give up. But don't get careless, OK?

I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini? Maya: I finally get to see you again, and... Phoenix: It's not your fault. You didn't do it. Maya: No, I... I did it... I killed that person. Phoenix: But that wasn't you. Maya: It doesn't matter. It might as well have been me. Phoenix: (I can't believe something like this happened...The events of that gloomy, rainy afternoon that started this whole mess...keep playing through my mind...) Episode 2Reunion, and Turnabout June 16, 3:34 PMWright & Co. Law Offices ???: What depressing rain... Do you understand how depressed that makes me!? Do you!? Phoenix: Uh, I guess... ???: But actually, more than being depressed, I'm angry. Angry at that weather girl on TV. \"I think our little rainy spell will take a break with a day of sun!\"...is what that girl said! I'd stake my life on it! Phoenix: Well, it's the weather... ???: But that's why I didn't bother to bring an umbrella today. What nerve, calling herself a weather girl! She's going to hear about my $1500 suit! Phoenix: Um... About your case... Unless you're planning on suing the weather girl...? ???: ... I'm sorry. I thought that before we got down to business, we could have some friendly chatter. My name is Dr. Turner Grey. I'm a surgeon. Phoenix: (Remind me never to end up under his knife...) Grey: I'm here today because of this incident. Phoenix: \"Malpractice at Grey Surgical Clinic. Fourteen In-Patients Lose Their Lives!\" ...Oh. You're... the doctor at...? Grey: It's really quite upsetting. Did you hear me!? UPSETTING! Phoenix: Yes, yes, I heard you. I agree, it's quite upsetting, Dr. Grey. Grey: The one that screwed up was that nurse! It was her that got the medications mixed up and killed those 14 patients! And yet! Now listen good! And yet! That nurse had the nerve to go and die before admitting to her wrongdoing! She didn't even offer any sort of explanation to me! And this is the kicker! She up and has herself a grand ol' accident and crashed her car! Smash! Crunch! Instantly transforming her car into the accordion model! Phoenix: (That's right... About a year ago, all the tabloid shows were talking about it. Fourteen victims of medical malpractice and the nurse's mysterious fatal accident. There were rumors that Dr. Grey had actually caused that crash. People said it was to forever hide the person responsible for the malpractice incident.) Grey: Why would I...? Now, I'm just going to say this once -- Why on Earth would I want to kill that nurse? She's the one who killed those 14 patients! Not me! Phoenix: I think you need to take a deep breath, doctor, and focus... More to the point, this case is over a year old. Why bring it up now...? Grey: That's simple! Because the situation is slipping out of my grasp. This just won't do. My clinic isn't seeing nearly as many patients nowadays. Do you understand what that means!? It means they're not coming to my clinic! Phoenix: (You don't say...? If it were me, I don't think I'd want to go either.) So... what would you like me to do about it...? Grey: I want you to help me prove I'm innocent. Phoenix: Um, you do realize I'm a lawyer, not a private investigator, right? Grey: No, this is something only you can do. Phoenix: ...? Grey: Maya Fey. You know this girl, correct? Phoenix: ...! (Maya! Why would he know her name...!?) Grey: I heard you were working under her for a little while. Phoenix: Well, yes... I mean... Hey, wait a second here! I worked UNDER her!? Grey: Yes. Am I wrong? She told me, so I'm not quite sure if... Phoenix: Well, we worked a few trials together. But she went back to her hometown to undergo more training. Grey: Ah, yes, I heard. It must be lonely for you. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Wait... I'm not...! Grey: She must be an extraordinary girl to handle such rigid training. Phoenix: Huh? Grey: I have an acquaintance who knows a lot about these mystical sorts of things. She's the one who introduced me to Ms. Fey. Phoenix: (Is Maya... really that famous...?) Grey: And I've already set up an appointment. Phoenix: For what? Grey: What else!? A channeling! I'm going to have her call the spirit of that nurse that went and got herself killed! Phoenix: O-Oh. (Maya... I wonder what she's up to right now...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey clan have always been spirit mediums. (Changed from [We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums.] in the original release) It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (That's what she told me... I guess she's learned to accept her responsibilities and become an adult...) Grey: Not counting training, this will be her first time channeling a spirit, so she gave me one condition before accepting my request. Phoenix: A condition...? Grey: The condition is you, Mr. Wright. She said that she wouldn't do the channeling without first seeing you again. Phoenix: Me...? Grey: And that is why I've searched you out! You want to see her too, don't you!? Phoenix: (And so... that is how I ended up visiting Maya's hometown with the doctor...) June 19, 1:25 PMKurain Village Phoenix: (So this is Kurain Village; Maya's hometown.) ???: ... Phoenix: W-Why, hello there. ???: ... Phoenix: Hmm... What an odd little girl. ???: Hey! Wait up, Pearly!! Phoenix: (Hm? Someone else is coming this way...) ???: Niiiiiiiick! Phoenix: M-Maya. How are you...? It's good to see you again. Maya: Wow, I didn't think you'd really show up! Phoenix: It's not that big a deal. You made it sound like you were soooo far away. Maya: Well, maybe I exaggerated... just a little. Phoenix: It was only 2 hours by train. If I had known you were this close, I'd have visited more. Maya: No! You're not allowed. I already decided, you know. Until I become an adult, I have to work hard and be strong by myself... Phoenix: Oh... well... Anyway, congratulations. I'm glad to hear training is going well for you. Maya: Heh, heh... Examine Phone booth Phoenix: It's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. My cell phone doesn't get reception up here, so who knows. I may need it later. Bus shelter Phoenix: An old bus stop. It says \"Kurain Village\" on the sign post. The buses seem incredibly inconvenient since they only come 3 times a day. Giant rock Phoenix: A giant rock that seems to be reaching for the sky. Its origins are written on a beat-up, old sign. It looks like this giant rock is called the \"Kurain Boulder\". There's a really complex explanation written here, but long story short, it's a big stone for spirits to live in... Or something like that... Road and houses further Phoenix: Rustic, thatch-roofed houses where the other villagers live line the street. They're nowhere near as large or as nice as the manor in front of me. It's kind of odd that I don't see any of the other villagers walking around, though... Fey Manor Phoenix: The biggest, most elegant of the buildings I can see from here. This is Fey Manor; the place Maya calls home. It's easy to be overwhelmed by its presence... Talk Today's channeling Phoenix: Looks like you've finally become a full-fledged medium, taking on your first job. Maya: Yeah. I didn't think it would be this soon. Phoenix: But this case... Do you know the messy story behind it...? Maya: Ha ha ha, behold the power of the Maya Intelligence Network! Let's see. Fourteen people died because of malpractice on Dr. Grey's part, right? And to pin the blame on the nurse, he killed her in what appeared to be a car accident! Phoenix: Huh? Um, so what is this \"Maya Intelligence Network\" anyway...? Maya: The tabloids. Phoenix: That's what I thought. Maya: ... Ha ha ha. I'm just pulling your leg, Nick! What really happened is the exact opposite. I heard all about it from Dr. Grey. Phoenix: ... Maya: Oh, come on, Nick! I wouldn't take a crazed killer as a client! That's too scary, even for me. Phoenix: (Y-Yeah, I guess so.) Kurain Village Phoenix: So this is your hometown, huh, Maya? Maya: Yup! Kurain Village... But I've heard people call this place \"Medium Valley\", too. Phoenix: Interesting... So everyone that lives here is a spirit medium? Maya: Pretty much. Most of my ancestors were too, I think... Phoenix: (That's probably true since the Fey ability to communicate with the dead is so strong...) Maya: Actually, only the women of this village are mediums. Phoenix: So what do the men do? Maya: They usually work someplace outside the village. The girl earlier Phoenix: Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you about that girl I saw earlier. Do you know her? Maya: Oh, you mean Pearly? Phoenix: Pearly? Maya: Pearl Fey. She's my cousin. Isn't she adorable? Just like yours truly! Phoenix: Cousin... Wait, then that means... Is she also a...? Maya: Yup. She's a medium, too. Pearly's a real genius when it comes to channeling! Phoenix: Hmm, I see. I hope I didn't scare her when I tried to talk to her earlier. Maya: Nah, it's not you. My aunt drilled it into her head that \"if a suspicious-looking person tries to talk to you, run away\". Phoenix: S-Suspicious-looking...!? Maya: Well, you're not wearing training clothes, for starters... Phoenix: Of course not. Maya: Pearly is my aunt's most valued treasure, so she's not allowed to go outside of town. She doesn't know much about the world outside of Kurain Village. Phoenix: Aunt? Maya: Pearly's mother is my aunt, duh. Come on, Nick. Present Attorney's Badge Maya: Ah, it's good to see this tarnished badge again. Phoenix: What do you mean by \"tarnished\"...? Maya: Well, look. This badge is like every other. It's bound to lose its color and shine after years and years. But you know, polishing it up once in a while wouldn't be a bad idea. Maya Fey profile Maya: Ha ha ha. I'm warning you! I'm not the same weak Maya you knew a year ago, Nick! Phoenix: You seem to have a lot of faith in yourself. Maya: You'll see soon enough. I think you'll be totally shocked by how good my hamburgers are now! Phoenix: (Were you training to be a medium or a cook?) Turner Grey profile Maya: Hey, it's my client! Phoenix: \"Client,\" huh? You're really serious about your work, aren't you? Maya: I thought I'd say it once, just to try it out, like how you always say, \"My client.\" Any other evidence Maya: Hmm, nothing really comes to mind, Nick. Phoenix: Don't say that with such a big smile on your face. Maya: Ha ha. What can I say? I'm in a good mood today. Any other profile Phoenix: What do you think about this person? Maya: Hey, have I told you this one yet, Nick? We have a legend in this village. It goes like this. \"All the woman of the Fey clan are beauties.\" Well? Phoenix: ...And that's a legend now? After clearing all Talk options: Maya: Well, Nick, I've got to get going. It's about time for the channeling to start. Phoenix: Huh? Oh, yeah... Maya: I'm doing the channeling in my house, so come on in, OK? After I'm done, we can grill up some juicy burgers! Phoenix: Alright. Good luck, Maya. Maya: Thanks! Phoenix: (Well... At least she's still the same perky Maya.) June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Grey: Ah, Mr. Wright. I'm so glad you showed. Phoenix: Some nice weather we're having today. Aren't you happy? Grey: No, not at all. That stupid weather girl made the wrong call again. \"It will rain cats and dogs today!\" she said with a straight face. I can't believe they allow such misguided reports on the public airwaves! Phoenix: (Looks like talking about the weather with this guy is just asking for punishment...) Grey: ...But anyway, this is a splendid manor. Phoenix: (No argument there... It's hard to believe that this is Maya's house, though...) Grey: I was given a guidemap to this building. Here, Mr. Wright. I have a copy for you too. Guidemap added to the Court Record. Examine Door Phoenix: A door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. It looks like there is a strong lock on this door to top it off. Writing on top of the door Phoenix: Someone with a lot of skill wrote these four Chinese characters with a brush. Oh look, here's a translation: \"Once in a Lifetime.\" Its message is people should value their ghostly meetings as once in a lifetime chances. Blue board Phoenix: A piece of cloth with a ton of finely-written characters jammed onto it. Probably esoteric knowledge only mediums should know. ...Hmm, let's see... Here's one in English... It says... \"100 Ways to Save Money\". ... Being a medium sounds like a rough way of life... Door to the Winding Way Phoenix: This door leads out to the Winding Way. The weather outside looks really nice. Talk Today's channeling Phoenix: What are you going to do once the nurse's spirit has been called? Grey: Isn't it obvious? I'm going to have her write a signed confession. Phoenix: A signed confession? Grey: Yes, a confession. Pay attention! I'll have her write this: \"One year ago, on May 2nd, 14 patients died due to my negligence. And then, on May 24th, I fell asleep at the wheel and died in a car accident due to my further negligence. I'm sorry and I apologize for being negligent.\" That's what I'll have her write! With a confession, the rain falling on my soul can finally stop. Phoenix: O-Oh, I see... Maya Phoenix: So, how did you hear about Maya Fey...? Grey: I heard about her from an acquaintance; a girl studying the occult at the college. That girl introduced me to this village. This is the home of the Kurain School of Channeling. Phoenix: The home, huh...? Grey: And Ms. Maya is a daughter of the \"Master\", I hear. Phoenix: Master...? Grey: Anyway, do you see that door? That's the room where people and spirits meet. Ms. Maya's aunt is in there right now. Would you care to meet her...? Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Look, here's my attorney's badge. Grey: Are you trying to compete with me and my profession with that piece of scrap? Phoenix: ...Uh... Grey: I am a surgeon. Compared to you lawyers, I'm practically a saint! Yes, well, I don't exactly have any patients right now, but, and listen good! I'm not the one that made the mistake! Phoenix: (This doctor needs his head examined...) Guidemap (Fey Manor) Phoenix: Wow, this manor is really nice, don't you think? Grey: Do you honestly think this place is all that impressive? Don't make me laugh. Phoenix: Huh? Grey: This is the countryside. Land here is dirt cheap. I will have something much greater one day! I will build my own grand mansion! Did you hear me!? A grand MANSION! This manor will seem like nothing! Phoenix: (Uh, could you keep that shaking fist away from my face? Thanks...) Maya Fey profile Grey: She's still young, but one day, she'll bear a big responsibility. She'll be the Master, you know. The MASTER! Phoenix: (I guess there are \"Master\" mediums, too...) Morgan Fey profile Grey: That's Ms. Maya's aunt. Earlier, she made me eat some sort of traditional dessert the size of a tea saucer! Hmm, I wonder if Ms. Morgan ever performs channelings herself...? Any other profile Phoenix: What do you have to say about this person, Dr. Grey? Grey: ...This person... Hmm... Judging by their face... Phoenix: W-What is it? Grey: They have a weak stomach. Phoenix: R-Really... June 19Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: (Wow... It's such a strange atmosphere in here... These flickering lights... I guess they're candles...) ???: Good sir! Who might you be...? Phoenix: Aaah! I-I'm, uh, my name is Phoenix Wright... ???: Oh... You must be that good sir... Phoenix: (\"Good sir\"...? Is she talking about me?) ???: You are a lawyer, are you not, good sir? I have heard much about you from Mystic Maya. Phoenix: Is that so? (\"Mystic\" Maya...?) ???: I am Mystic Maya's aunt, Morgan Fey. Phoenix: N-Nice to meet you. Morgan: Ah, I had wanted to speak with you about a certain incident, good sir. It would seem that perhaps you ask too much of Mystic Maya in performing your duties. Most unbecoming, I'm afraid. Phoenix: Huh? Morgan: Don't tell me you have already forgotten? That was it not for Mystic Maya and her assistance, you would surely not have won... Phoenix: (First a girl that runs away, and now an old lady who says I stink at doing my job... When did I become the poster boy for \"How Not to Make a First Impression\"...?) Morgan: The past is the past though. Let us speak of the present now. Phoenix: ...Ah, thank you... Examine Door Phoenix: The Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. There is a giant iron lock where the handle is. It feels like a curtain that separates the normal world from the spirit one. Floor panels on left Phoenix: This is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air. Altar Phoenix: I guess this is an altar. Whatever it is, it feels very important. (Changed from [I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important.] in the original release) A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement. Morgan: Good sir! I wonder if you would please not touch the sacred objects. Those objects are being offered to the spirits. If you were to touch them, good sir, they would become cursed. Yes, cursed. Phoenix: (She really didn't have to talk down to me. I'm not that much of an idiot...) Folding screen Phoenix: This folding screen is really showing its age. All of its edges are a bit tattered. The lettering is fading too. I think I recognize a few of the characters on here... ...Ku ...ra ...in... I'm pretty sure that's what it says... Maybe I'll ask Maya about it later... Space behind folding screen Phoenix: There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. Talk Maya Phoenix: So why do you add \"Mystic\" to Maya's name. Isn't that a little... strange? Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Yes! Morgan: How dare you be so rude and disrespectful towards Mystic Maya! Phoenix: I-I'm sorry. Morgan: She must be addressed by her proper title, good sir. You must call her \"Mystic Maya\"! Phoenix: Um, uh... So, about Mystic Maya... Uh... Morgan: It is the blood. Phoenix: Excuse me? \"Blood\"? Morgan: Mystic Maya carries the blood of the Master. In actuality, she is the only one remaining. Phoenix: (Only one remaining...? What's that supposed to mean?) Morgan: Mystic Maya is the last of the rightful heirs of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: OK... Then... where do you stand...? Morgan: That is a little more complicated... Although a woman of the Fey family, I am merely a member of the branch family. Phoenix: ...Branch family? What's that? Morgan: It is as it sounds. For a member of the branch family, no matter her spiritual power, she can never become the Master of the Kurain School. Phoenix: So... how strong are you...? Morgan: ... It is a shame, however I will admit. I can not even begin to compare the lowliness of my power to the Master's. Phoenix: (So that's how it is...) Today's channeling Phoenix: So today's channeling will be her first? Morgan: Yes, good sir. Because the spirit of a person who dies in a traffic accident is usually very strong, it is usually easier to call that person to our world. Phoenix: (\"Traffic accident\" indeed.) Morgan: The channeling will take place here, in this Channeling Chamber, good sir. As you can see, I am in the process of preparing. Channeling Chamber Phoenix: So... this room is the... Channeling Chamber...? Morgan: The place where a spirit medium speaks with those who have departed. Phoenix: I don't suppose you'd mind if we observed the session... Morgan: Do not even think of such nonsense! Only the medium and the client may enter here. Phoenix: O-Oh. Morgan: The secrets of the Kurain Techniques can not be seen by just anybody. Phoenix: (That never stopped Maya from doing it in front of me before...) Morgan: It is also for your safety, good sir, if something were to go wrong. That is why, while channeling is being performed, that heavy door is securely locked... Phoenix: Oh, that's what the lock is for... Present Maya Fey profile Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Y-Yes! Morgan: When did you... take a hidden picture of Mystic Maya!? Phoenix: Wh-Wh-What!? Wait... It's not like that at all! Morgan: It is unforgivable! Phoenix: Ow-ow-ow! (Why did she slap me?) Turner Grey profile Phoenix: About this person... Morgan: Oh! It is that man, is it not? A man who wishes to borrow a departed spirit's power to hide the lack of his own. What an insignificant man. Phoenix: Insignificant...? Morgan: That would mean you are that man's insignificant little friend, dear sir. Phoenix: (Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?) Anything else Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Ack! Morgan: We would like to begin the channeling at 3 o'clock. If you don't mind, good sir, would you mind allowing me to make preparations? Phoenix: Uh, um, sure... go ahead... (She's a Fey alright! Just as odd as the rest.) After clearing all Talk options: Morgan: ... Oh, yes. I wonder if you have yet to meet Pearl, good sir. Phoenix: Pearl? Morgan: She is an adorable, angelic young girl. Phoenix: Oh, that odd... Morgan: She is my daughter. Now then, what was it you were about to say...? Phoenix: Wh-What a cute daughter you have... Ahaha... Morgan: A pure heart that knows not of the evils in this world is a powerful thing, good sir. Please refrain from affiliating with her, I request. Phoenix: (Well, it's not like I had the chance to anyway...) Morgan: I must insist and stress that you not let it occur. Phoenix: Okay, okay, I get it! June 19Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Wow. This garden is really breath-taking. Someone put a lot of love into it. What is that over there...? ...Is that an incinerator? It looks a little out of place in a garden like this...) Examine Garden Phoenix: A splendid garden with a small lamp and traditional decorations. It's a bit small to walk around in... Although, that incinerator piques my curiosity... Incinerator Phoenix: It's a small incinerator. I don't think garbage trucks come all the way out here to a little village like this. So every family has to burn their own trash. Side room Phoenix: It looks like there's a room over there, too. A peaceful feeling is emanating from it. Urn Phoenix: It's a really old urn. The ashes of a person long dead are inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on. June 19Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: (So this is... the Side Room. Looks like it's more of a break room. There is bedding spread out on the floor. It looks like someone's sleeping in one. I shouldn't disturb them...) Examine Wooden bear sculpture Phoenix: It's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. \"Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling\" What the!? It's a souvenir. So does this mean it's easy to spot bears here... And for them to spot you...? *gulp* Alcove Phoenix: It's a small alcove. I have no idea what it's supposed to mean or symbolize. If I had one of these in the office, it would end up as storage space. But here, it's decorated with some pretty flowers and a beautiful hanging scroll. Sliding door Phoenix: This is the first time I've seen a sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard. Bed on right Phoenix: There's bedding spread out on the floor. Is that someone sleeping in one over there? She's probably an exhausted medium taking a break and catching some z's. If I wake her up, she might be grumpy and throw a spell on me. It's probably a good idea to not disturb her sleep... Winding Way (after visiting Side Room and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber) ???: Hey! You! Hold on, now! This gal's got a few questions to ask! Phoenix: (Hmm... I'm sure I've heard that southern accent somewhere before...) ???: Oh, well I'll be! It's Mr. Phoenix Wright! How ya been!? Haven't seen you in, what, a year!? Phoenix: Um... You... are... uh... Lotta Hair Phoenix: Um, Lotta Hair, was it? ???: L-L-Lotta Who!? Wait, you best not be making fun of my hair, now! Phoenix: Ah, no, um, I wasn't \"making fun\"... I was \"complimenting\" you on your fine hair... ???: Hmph, I dare say yer one heartless man, Mr. Wright. It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty. But looks like you already forgot that. Phoenix: Hold up... you were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak... ???: Minor detail. Stop being so uptight; lettin' little things get in the way. The name's Hart. Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it! Phoenix: Oh yeah! That's it! Lotta: Now listen here. I'm here to take some pictures today. Gonna get myself a real scoop. Phoenix: Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean. Lotta: You betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous \"paranormal photographer\"!? Leads to: \"Oh, that's right!\" Lotta Hart Phoenix: You're Lotta Hart, right...? Lotta: Bingo! I'm the one and only \"paranormal photographer\", Lotta Hart! Phoenix: Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean. Lotta: Of course! And today, I'm gonna get myself a real scoop! You wait and see! Leads to: \"Oh, that's right!\" Who are you again? Phoenix: Sorry, but who are you again? ???: Oh Lawdy! I've met some cold men in my days, but you... You're in an icebox of yer own! Phoenix: Come on, am I really that bad...? ???: Put yer noggin to some use! You've gotta remember who I am! It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty. Phoenix: Ah! You're the one from that trial! ???: See, I knew you could remember if you tried! Phoenix: You were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak... ???: Why don't we let bygones be bygones, now. It's yesterday's news, right? Name's Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it, ya hear!? Phoenix: Um... So what brings you here today? Lotta: Hah! You should already know! I'm here for the big scoop! I can feel it! Phoenix: Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean. Lotta: You betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous \"paranormal photographer\"!? Leads to: \"Oh, that's right!\" Lotta: Oh, that's right! This ain't no time to be wastin' time! The channeling's about to get started! Phoenix: Is it that time already!? Lotta: We all should hurry up and get to the Meditation Room. ...What are you waiting around for!? Come on! Phoenix: (Lotta Hart, huh? I've been judging her harshly because of that case, but, I guess looking back, we had some good times, too...) June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Morgan: We will now begin the channeling. Mystic Maya and honored guest, please proceed into the Channeling Chamber. Grey: With this, I can finally swat all those pesky flies, once and for all! You hear me!? They won't be able to say a single bad thing about me after this! You would love to hear them apologize, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Me!? Oh, uh, yeah, I sure would. Morgan: Mystic Maya, do you have the Channeling Chamber key? Maya: Yup, right here. Morgan: That is most satisfactory. That key is one-of-a-kind, so please take care of it well. Maya: It'll be fine, Aunt Morgan. I won't lose it, trust me! OK, Dr. Grey. Let's get started. Grey: Finally! Let's go! *click* Morgan: Now let us wait patiently out here for them. Please have some lovely bitter green tea and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts... Lotta: Hold on, now, granny! Morgan: ...Granny? Lotta: How come we ain't allowed in that room!? Morgan: Dear madam, you have an \"impressive\" grasp of English. From where did you learn it? Lotta: What!? I'm from the heart of the heartland! Morgan: Is that so? Then I humbly request that you return to this \"Heart of the Heartland\". Lotta: Wh-What are ya...? Morgan: This is Kurain Village. If you can not follow our traditions and rules, we request that you leave! Lotta: ...! ... Sorry. Phoenix: (Wow. She shut Lotta up! Now THAT's impressive!) Morgan: Now then, let us wait. *BANG* Lotta: Hey now! Wh-What was that just now!? Phoenix: (It came from inside the Channeling Chamber...) *BANG* Lotta: Hey! Th-That's a gunshot! Morgan: E-Excuse me!? Lotta: I've heard that sound before. It's a gunshot! I'd bet my afro on it! Phoenix: (M-Maya! Maya's in there!) Break into the Chamber Lotta: Well, Mister Lawyer! What's the plan!? Phoenix: What else!? We're going to break in! Lotta: What!? But... But there's only one key and that kid's got it. Phoenix: We're going to have to break the door. Is that alright, Ms. Fey? Morgan: Well, yes... But there is one matter... That is... Phoenix: Don't try to stop me! You can send the repair bill to the Wright & Co. Law Offices later! Leads to: \"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\" Ask Morgan what to do Phoenix: Ms. Fey! What should we do!? Lotta: Yellow-bellied chicken liver! What are ya waiting for!? Kick it down already! Phoenix: But... The key... Morgan: That key is one-of-a-kind. In this world, there is only that one. Even I am powerless to open that door. Phoenix: (Hmm, there is really no other way...) Alright. Stand aside! I'm going to break the door down! Morgan: W-Wait! Please! That sort of recklessness... Leads to: \"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\" Lotta: Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man! *SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!* Phoenix: D-Dr. Grey!! *klik* ???: ...I... ...I was... murdered... Phoenix: M-Maya? ???: That man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him... Phoenix: Wh-What!? *klik* Phoenix: Lotta! At a time like this!? Lotta: Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!? Step away from there! Morgan: Please leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police! Phoenix: But, but... Morgan: Hurry! Before there are more victims here! Lotta: Hey, let's go, City Boy! Leave this to the granny! June 19Kurain Village Phoenix: (My cell phone doesn't get reception way out here... So I ended up using the phone booth to call the police...) Lotta: And...? Phoenix: They're on their way. Lotta: That's good. Lawdy, I saw a genuine \"mysterious phenomenon\"... Phoenix: (She seems really on edge because of all this... Not that I blame her... I'm scared to death by what's going on...) Talk What you witnessed Lotta: Hey, Mister. That gal... Maya. She wasn't the one that pulled the trigger, was she...? Phoenix: (Oh, yeah... Lotta doesn't know that when Maya is channeling, her whole physical appearance changes.) Lotta: Then again... Weren't there only the two of 'em in there? I reckon she musta done it then... Dr. Grey Phoenix: Lotta, what do you know about Dr. Grey? Lotta: Not much, but I did some digging... That's one gent with a bad reputation. Phoenix: Really? Lotta: I hear he's good at surgery and stuff, but his personality stinks like wet sheep. Phoenix: (I sort of got the same impression myself...) Lotta: He's real controllin'. Soon as his nurse or patients don't do what he says, he starts a-hollerin'. Musta been real rough to work for him. Present Anything Lotta: Hey, they'll be here soon, right? The police, I mean. I reckon you should be gettin' back to the crime scene, now. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess so...) June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Morgan: Ah, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Ms. Fey! How's, um... Mystic... Maya? Morgan: She has returned to \"this world\". The Spirit Severing Technique was successful. Phoenix: Let me see her, please! Morgan: She is still unconscious. I humbly request that you wait outside for her recovery. Phoenix: (Guess I just have to wait... *sigh*) Gumshoe: The police are here! Sorry to keep you waiting! Huh? ...You again!? Phoenix: What are you doing all the way out here, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: It's actually kinda funny. I was in the area for a business trip, pal. Well, time to check out the crime scene. I'll have to question everyone here later on, so just sit tight, alright? Phoenix: (Why is he grinning at me...?) Morgan: Shall I show you to the scene of the crime, Detective Gymshoe? Gumshoe: Um... My name isn't Gymshoe... Phoenix: (The two of them went into the Channeling Chamber... I guess all I can do for now is see what everyone else has to say...) June 19Kurain Village Lotta: ... Phoenix: (She's probably scared out of her wits after having a murder take place right near her.) Lotta? Lotta: GAWDDON'TLETITBEMENEXT! Phoenix: Eek! Don't scare me like that! Lotta: What do you mean!? Yer the one scaring me! If I weren't so tough, you'd have another dead body on yer hands -- mine! Talk Any ideas Leads to: \"Did you see or notice anything that stuck out at you?\" Present Maya Fey profile Lotta: Must be an awful thing to see each other again and have this happen. Never woulda guessed that gal would end up being a murderer. Phoenix: That wasn't Maya! She was being controlled by a spirit... Lotta: Come on, now, City Boy. Ya really think the cops'll believe that? Turner Grey profile Lotta: Hey, it's that Dr. Grey guy. Pity what happened to him. Pretty scary what ghouls and ghosts can do to a man, huh? Gawd rest his poor soul. Phoenix: (Hmm... Since when was Lotta so religious...?) Morgan Fey profile Lotta: That old lady sure can be forceful. She scared me back there. ...Well, only a little, now, ya hear? Dick Gumshoe profile Lotta: I swear I've seen his face before. Maybe during that last case... Whenever something happens, this detective guy is always there. I wonder if he's the real baddie behind everything? Phoenix: (Somehow, I highly doubt it...) Anything else Lotta: Nope. Don't know nothin' about that. Things that don't catch my eye, don't catch my interest. Phoenix: (And she calls herself a journalist??) Phoenix: Did you see or notice anything that stuck out at you? Lotta: Nah... Well, maybe one thing... Phoenix: What is it!? Lotta: Turns out my poor stomach's not good at handlin' this kind of thing. Phoenix: Huh-what? Lotta: Curses and ghosts and stuff comin' back to get ya... This is just too much, I say. Phoenix: What is too much? Lotta: Being an occult photographer. That's some scary stuff, so I think I'm gonna try being a celebrity photographer, now. Phoenix: Going after photos more within your reach from now on? More glamour, less gore? Lotta: ... Phoenix: What's up? Lotta: Oh, yeah! Phoenix: Wh-What is it? Lotta: I took some hot pictures earlier! Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: Remember!? I took some pictures at the murder scene inside! Phoenix: (Ack! She did! Two even!) Lotta: \"The Séance Murder\"... I sure like the ring of that. It'll be a sensational story! Phoenix: L-Lotta! Lotta: Sorry, but my journalistic sense is burnin' inside me! Hate to cut and run, but I'm headin' back in! Gotta beat those cops to the scoop of the century! UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhahahahahahahahahahaha... ... Phoenix: (I don't know who's scarier... Lotta or the spirits... And why does it feel like we've been through this before...?) June 19Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: (The police are busily running here and there, and I don't see Maya anywhere...) Gumshoe: H-Hey, you! Don't touch anything! Phoenix: Look, I really need to ask you some questions! Gumshoe: Umm... Don't look at me like I'm some sort of uncaring jerk... Tell you what, pal. I'll let you ask me a few questions, alright? Examine Anywhere Gumshoe: Hey, pal! No touching without my permission! Phoenix: I'm just looking at it. Gumshoe: Hey, I can't be too careful if a kid like her can be a murder suspect, now can I? Phoenix: (I guess if I want to search this room, I'm going to have to come back later...) Talk Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: I hate to break this to you, pal, but... with the way things look now, that girl's the only one who could've done it. Phoenix: (Yeah. Only Maya and the victim were inside this room, after all...) But Maya is... Gumshoe: You can ask more about her later, pal. Right now, I've got a job to do and that's collecting evidence. Phoenix: (Detective Gumshoe looks like a real professional. And yet, something about his expression still looks the same...) Cause of death Phoenix: So... Dr. Grey was shot with a gun, huh? Gumshoe: He was shot in the forehead. But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: But he was also stabbed in the chest with a knife. Phoenix: (...A knife?) Gumshoe: Basically, the vic was first stabbed, then he was shot. (Changed from [After being stabbed, the final blow was a shot from a gun.] in the original release) Present Anything Gumshoe: Ah, I'm really busy right now. I can take a look at it later, alright, pal? Phoenix: (He didn't even take a glance at it...) June 19Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: (Hmm, I'm pretty sure there was someone sleeping here earlier...) ???: Like, how can I help you? Phoenix: Ack! Ah, I'm, uh... That is... I... ???: Um, like, so isn't it about time to start? Phoenix: Huh? Time to start what? ???: You know, like, the channeling! Phoenix: Channeling...? Oh, oh, oh, oh!! No, actually, the situation has kind of changed... ???: Huh? Like, what do you mean? Phoenix: Please stay calm, but... there has been a murder! (Changed from [Please stay calm, but... a murder has taken place!] in the original release) ???: ... Um, so, like... A murder is that thing where, like, one person kills another, right? Phoenix: Yes! A person has killed another person! ???: Oh, that's... Uh... What are the words I'm looking for...? It's like... ...like totally a bummer. Phoenix: ...Yeah... (After all that effort, that's all she had to say?) ???: Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to, like, introduce myself. Ini: My name is Ini Miney. Um... At the college, I'm researching and studying \"parapsychology\". Phoenix: \"Parapsychology\"? Ini: That's right. Um... I think people, like, usually call it, \"occult studies\" or something. Like supernatural phenomenon, ESP and psychic powers. That sort of stuff. Phoenix: (That's pretty out there...) I'm Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. Examine Bed on right Phoenix: You left the blanket a mess. Are you going to fold it? Ini: Like I had a really good nap, and, like... I was thinking of leaving it like this, so, like, it's all set for tonight. Talk Ini Miney Phoenix: So what brings you here today? Ini: Um, like, so... I was the one who told Dr. Grey about this place. He asked me, like, \"Do you know of a good spirit medium?\" Phoenix: (Hmm, Dr. Grey did say something about being introduced to this place.) Ini: Cause, like, talking to dead people and, like, multiple personalities are my thing... Phoenix: I see... Then why were you taking a nap here? Ini: Like... I wasn't feeling good. Phoenix: Huh? Ini: I'm, like, allergic to sesame seeds. They, like, must've put some in the food they served for lunch. Phoenix: Oh, that doesn't sound fun. Ini: So I, like, felt sick, and came in here to, like, sleep. I totally feel, like, I've wasted my time 'cause I, like, slept a long time. What happened Phoenix: So you were sleeping here the entire time? Ini: Yeah. Ever since lunch... Phoenix: So you don't know anything about the murder that took place? Ini: Like, what? Oh, that! I, like, totally know nothing. So who was, like, you know, killed...? Phoenix: The surgeon that requested the channeling, Dr. Grey. Ini: ... The victim (appears after \"Ini Miney\" and \"What happened\") Phoenix: You and Dr. Grey knew each other, right? Ini: ...! I don't know any Dr. Grey! Phoenix: Oh really...? Then what was all that talk about him earlier? (Changed from [That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...] in the original release) Ini: Huh!? ...Well, uh... Like, a long, long time ago... I was, like, a patient, yeah. Phoenix: (She sounds like she's trying to hide something...) Present Maya Fey profile Ini: Oh, hey! That's, like, Maya Fey, right? She's, like, totally waaaay famous! Like, well, for people like us, like, you know? Phoenix: (\"Waaaay famous\"? Maya?) Ini: I mean, like, she's, like, the daughter of the Master, right? Phoenix: (Hmm... Well, at least she remembers some things.) Ini Miney profile Ini: Um... This face... Like, I think I've seen it somewhere before... Phoenix: What!? ...Y-You're joking, right? Ini: Ha ha, like, of course I am, silly! Phoenix: (Oh, thank goodness...) Any other evidence Ini: Like, I'm really sorry, but I'm not all that smart... so I don't, like, get it. Phoenix: (Hmm. Why does it feel like she's just putting on an act?) Any other profile Ini: I'm, like, totally bad at remembering people's names. Phoenix: Oh? Ini: But I, like, remember seeing that face somewhere before, like, I think... Phoenix: Well, thanks for trying. (I didn't think it was possible for someone to be this much of an airhead...) June 19Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (There's no one here... as usual.) Ack! ...H-Hey... How are you? Pearl: ... Phoenix: You're Pearl, right? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Hmm. Silent as ever... ...? What's that she's got in her hand? I've seen it somewhere before...) Talk Any option Phoenix: Um... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: (...What is it!? Is it my hair? Is it too spiky? Not spiky enough!?) Present Anything Phoenix: Um... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: (...What is it!? Is it my hair? Is it too spiky? Not spiky enough!?) After clearing \"Any ideas\" Talk option in Kurain Village and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber and Fey Manor - Side Room: June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Morgan: Oh, dear madam... You have such impeccable timing. Ini: Like, what's all the buzz? Gumshoe: Ahem. Alright everyone, listen up! You too, pal! I'm going to give you all a brief update! Right now, it looks like the investigation's not going to be done until real late... Morgan: That is a terrible shame. I propose that everyone sleep here under the roof of the Fey Manor tonight. Phoenix: (What a mess. I can't believe how crazy this day turned out... Maya was arrested and taken away by the police. And I don't see myself getting any sleep tonight...) June 20, 8:02 AMFey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: (*yawn* Uuugh... Morning... I guess I must have nodded off at some point... I hope Maya's OK. I should hurry and get to the Detention Center, ASAP!) June 20, 10:34 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: N... Nick! Nick! I...! Phoenix: Maya! Maya: What am I going to do!? I never imagined it would turn out like this! Phoenix: Calm down, Maya! Take deep breaths. (Come to think of it, the first time I met her... It all started right here, in this detention center...) Maya: I finally... I finally get to see you again, and... Phoenix: It's not your fault. You didn't do it. Maya: No, I... I did it... I killed that person. Phoenix: But that wasn't you. Maya: It doesn't matter. It might as well have been me. I was too weak... and I... I couldn't control the spirit's power, so... Phoenix: (I don't want to bring up the case quite yet, but...) Maya: ...You don't have to be nice to me. I understand. Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. I wonder if he's bored. Not that I can tell since he never looks over this way. Talk Channeling Phoenix: So you're the Master or something of the Kurain School of Channeling...? Maya: Actually, my mother is for now. But since that title is passed from mother to daughter, I guess I will be someday... Phoenix: But many people think that channeling isn't real, that it's all just an act. Maya: You believe in us, don't you? Phoenix: Yeah... because I've seen it with my own eyes. (When Maya's channeling a spirit... not only her voice, but her whole physical appearance changes. It's a supernatural phenomenon that occurs every time. It happened this time, too... Dr. Grey said that he wanted to call the nurse, so... Maya's body must have taken on that nurse's appearance...) What happened Phoenix: What exactly happened in the Channeling Chamber? Maya: ... I went into that room with Dr. Grey, locked the door... and sat down across from him. Phoenix: OK... Maya: We closed our eyes...and I began the channeling. Phoenix: (This is sounding kind of creepy... like the beginning of a scary story...) Maya: And that's the last thing I remember... Phoenix: What? Maya: After a spirit comes into my body, I lose my self, my consciousness. Phoenix: Then, you don't remember a single thing? Maya: When I came to, I was being held in my aunt's arms. And there was blood... all over my clothes. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Maya: Oh! But... I do remember having a dream. Phoenix: A dream...? \"Dream\" (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: What kind of dream did you have while you were channeling...? Maya: Um... I can't remember it all that well, but... I was dead and buried in the ground. I couldn't move... and it was unbearable... Really suffocating... ...It went something like that. Phoenix: I... I see... (I have no idea what to say to that...) Maya: There was a really familiar smell too... Phoenix: Under the ground? Maya: Yeah, I can't quite place it, but I know I've smelled that same scent before... Present Maya Fey profile Maya: I... I can't face myself... Phoenix: (I should've known better...) Turner Grey profile Maya: !! T-The... That's the guy I k-killed... Phoenix: Ack! I'm sorry! (Why did I pull this picture out!?) Pearl Fey profile Maya: Pearly... She definitely has more than me... Phoenix: Huh? What are you talking about? Maya: Who I think the next Master should be... I mean, she's got more spiritual power than me, and she really works hard at her training... Phoenix: (Talk about bringing the mood down even further... *sigh*) Morgan Fey profile Maya: I... I can't face my aunt right now... Not now... that this has happened... Phoenix: It's alright, Maya. I'm sure she understands. She's on our side, after all. Maya: Yeah, I know... But still... Lotta Hart profile Maya: That's Lotta Hart... right? Phoenix: That girl is still after the next sensational photo. Maya: Ha ha. I guess some things never change. Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: I felt terrible during the questioning session... I mean, Gumshoe kept looking at me... with these really sad eyes... ... Any other evidence Maya: Sorry, Nick, but there's nothing really special about it. Any other profile Phoenix: So... what do you think about this person...? Maya: ...? Phoenix: (I guess I can't expect her to know anything about this person.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... (...I guess this is about all the information I'm going to gather for today...) I'll be back later, Maya. In the meantime, please make sure you prepare it, OK? Maya: Huh? \"It\"? What is \"it\"? Phoenix: The document requesting me to be your attorney, of course. Maya: ...! But... Phoenix: What's wrong? Maya: Are you sure? I mean, I'm guilty! I'm a murderer! Phoenix: No one's decided that yet. Maya: But I did! I killed that person... with these... two hands...! Phoenix: That's enough, Maya. Maya: It's hopeless! If you defend me, you'll lose, I'm sure... Phoenix: Stop it! Maya: ... ...Help me... Nick, help me... I'm scared... Phoenix: Don't worry, I will. When is the trial? Maya: It sounds like tomorrow. Phoenix: (As usual, zero prep time...) Alright. I'm going now. Maya: Wait. Phoenix: ...? Maya: This jewel... This is called a Magatama. It's a magical charm and it's always protected me. Give this to Pearly... And I'm sure she'll lend you her spiritual powers. Magatama received from Maya. Present Maya's Magatama Maya: Make sure you show that to Pearly, OK, Nick? I'm sure she'll be a big help to you. June 20Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Phew. It feels like I've been gone forever. But it's only been one day... (Oh, that's right!) Where's that newspaper Dr. Grey brought the other day...? ...Ah, here it is. Right on top of my desk. (This is the only thing he left behind that's going to be of any help...) Newspaper Clipping 1 added to the Court Record. Examine Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Until recently, it had been a normal, business-class hotel. Houseplant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. It's a memento of my boss, Mia... who passed away. The rest of the room may be in shambles, but I always manage to care for this little fella. Poster Phoenix: A poster of the TV action hero, the Steel Samurai. Maya stuck it up here right before she left. I wouldn't say that the Steel Samurai and an attorney's office are a good match, but Maya threatened to curse me with some magic spell... so I guess it can stay. Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long, a layer of dust has started to form. One of these days, I should try to build up the courage to read one... Maybe. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I keep it neat for those rare occasions when I actually have a client in the office. After visiting Wright & Co. Law Offices or Kurain Village: June 20Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (Maya must still be in questioning... I hope the detectives are taking it easy on her, but... these kinds of cases aren't taken lightly. I guess I'll come back later.) June 20Kurain Village Phoenix: (I have to save Maya, no matter what! It's her life on the line! What in the world happened in that room yesterday?) June 20Fey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: (The Meditation Room nurtures all mediums young and old. Even mediums in training, I'd wager. But it's pretty deserted today... ...probably because of the murder yesterday...) June 20Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today... I should take this chance and thoroughly check this room. If I'm lucky, I might uncover a clue or two... Morgan: Oh, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Good morning. Morgan: I am on my way to go meet Mystic Maya, and I thought to bring her some items to make her feel more at home. Namely, tea so bitter you lose your tongue and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts. Phoenix: I'm sure Maya will be very grateful... Morgan: That's \"Mystic Maya\", good sir! Phoenix: (Urk. She is one scary lady.) Morgan: Oh, dear, sweet Mystic Maya... Pearl wept constantly for you last night, as did I. Phoenix: (I know it's important for me to search the site, but I should ask her some questions too, while I have the chance...) Examine (left side) Door Phoenix: The Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. The lock on it is broken, because, well... I broke it. It doesn't seem possible, but I managed to break it pretty badly. When we want to do something bad enough, people can do the most amazing things. Floor panels on left Phoenix: This is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air. No matter what I do, my eyes keep getting drawn to the pool of blood in the center here. Altar Phoenix: I guess this is an altar. Whatever it is, it feels very important. (Changed from [I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important.] in the original release) A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement. I'd guess they're used during the channeling... Folding screen Phoenix: It's a beautiful and expensive folding screen. It also looks quite old. There seems to be some sort of sacred text written on it, but I can't read it. ... ! Th-This is... It's a hole! Could this have been made by a bullet? Folding Screen added to the Court Record. Space behind folding screen Phoenix: There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. I hope no one is hiding back there. Talk What happened Phoenix: I would like to ask you a few questions about what happened yesterday. Morgan: Do you mean that awful tragedy? ???: That man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him... Phoenix: M-Maya? Step away from there! Morgan: Please leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police! Phoenix: What happened here in this room after I left? Morgan: Well... First, I struck Mystic Maya on the head. Phoenix: To make her go unconscious, correct? Morgan: That is correct. Next, I performed the Spirit Severing Technique. Phoenix: \"Spirit Severing Technique\"? Morgan: The spirit of that nurse was inside of Mystic Maya's body. I used the technique to send the nurse's spirit back to the other world. Phoenix: (I wonder if this kind of testimony is even admissible in a court of law...) Channeling Chamber Phoenix: By the way, what is this room exactly...? Morgan: The Channeling Chamber? This room was created for the sole purpose of preventing such a tragedy as yesterday. Phoenix: What do you mean? Morgan: Sometimes, when an inexperienced medium calls an especially strong spirit, that spirit may become violent and revolt, as you witnessed yesterday. Phoenix: Revolt? But how? Morgan: When a spirit enters a medium's body, she loses her will and her self steps aside. To put it another way, the spirit is borrowing the medium's body, good sir. Phoenix: But isn't that extremely dangerous? Morgan: An experienced medium has little problem controlling a spirit. Phoenix: But Maya... I mean, Mystic Maya... That was her first channeling... Morgan: And that was why I insisted on locking the door. However, I never thought that would be calling danger upon the client himself... I am grateful that one of our heirlooms was not damaged in this horrible incident. Phoenix: And that would be...? (Changed from [And that is...?] in the original release) Morgan: That folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings. (Changed from [It is that folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings.] in the original release) Along with the Kurain Sacred Urn, they are this village's most treasured possessions. If I ever found out that something had happened to either one... Oh, the inhumanity... Phoenix: (Odd for her to be worrying about the folding screen at a time like this... I guess this isn't just some dilapidated old screen after all...) Pearl Phoenix: So... How is Pearl today...? Morgan: Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Morgan: In this world, Pearl is my most treasured possession. When compared to even Mystic Maya, Pearl has the spiritual power to become a Master. Phoenix: Th-That's very impressive. Morgan: Until now, the women of the branch family have thought themselves to be inferior. .. But. Pearl is different! Her spiritual strength is so great; even greater than some of the main family! Yes, Pearl is a channeling prodigy and is the pride of the branch family! Phoenix: (Wow... She's really fired up now...) Morgan: In any case... Our world is so different from yours, perhaps it is best for you to quit, good sir. Phoenix: \"Quit\"? Quit what? Present Maya's Magatama Morgan: ...Oh my! Phoenix: Wh-What is it? Morgan: That... That is Mystic Maya's Magatama. Why would you have this in your possession!? Phoenix: I-I'm sorry! Morgan: Return it to Mystic Maya at once! Phoenix: Y-Yes, madam! (Why did I feel like I was being scolded by my own mother just now...?) Folding Screen Morgan: Ah, so even someone such as yourself can take interest in something like this. This is the Kurain Channeling Technique Sacred Writings. There are 6 panels in all. Phoenix: I see... But that's not what caught my eye. You see this hole here...? Morgan: It is an old screen, you see. It is only logical that perhaps a bug or worm of some sort is the culprit. Phoenix: (Even though this looks nothing like the eating patterns of any bug I know...) Maya Fey profile Morgan: I can hardly believe Mystic Maya has become like this. Directly influenced by the likes of you, and becoming caught up in a situation such as this... Phoenix: I'm sorry... (...Hey, hold on! How is all this MY fault!?) Morgan: I told her so many times, as I have also told Pearl, \"Do not associate with strange old men you don't know\". Phoenix: (Well, that shouldn't apply to me then, especially since I'm hardly an \"old man\" yet!!) Turner Grey profile Morgan: That doctor was one of those people. Those who intend harm upon the spirits receive harm in return; it's karma at work. It seems that he was the one to take the nurse's life, wouldn't you agree? Phoenix: (I guess that's possible...) Pearl Fey profile Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Y...Yes? Morgan: When did you take this picture!? This is one of those... what are they called...? Those... \"hidden camera\" pictures! Phoenix: N-No!! It's not one of those at all!! Morgan: Such an unforgivable offense! You will hand it over to me! Phoenix: N-No! I won't! (If I ever want to talk about Pearl again, I should be much more careful...) Morgan Fey profile Morgan: It shows the same face as the one I see in the mirror every day. Phoenix: And? Anything else? Morgan: No. That is all. Phoenix: (Why in the world did I bother to show this to her!?) Any other evidence Morgan: I will be leaving shortly to meet with Mystic Maya. I simply do not have the time to look at such trivial matters. Any other profile Morgan: We usually do not welcome strangers into our village as they disturb the aura here. Especially people like you, good sir. Phoenix: H-Hey, what do you mean, \"especially people like me?\" Morgan: You selfishly make Mystic Maya help you with your work... You should be thankful I have not taken your life for such a disrespectful act. Phoenix: Y-Yes, madam... Morgan: And even more importantly, remember that if anything were to happen to Pearl... Phoenix: (What is that supposed to mean!?) After clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen: Morgan: Well, then, I do believe it is time for me to take my leave. Phoenix: Alright. Please tell Maya I said hi. Morgan: What was that!? Phoenix: Uh, I mean, Mystic Maya. Morgan: I will tell her. Phoenix: (...*sigh*) June 20Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Little Pearl isn't here today... Maybe she's at school?) June 20Fey ManorSide Room Ini: Oh, hey! Like, you're that guy from yesterday... The, uh, dentist guy... Phoenix: No, no, I'm a lawyer. Ini: That's right! Um... Mr. Smith, Esquire. Phoenix: ...That's \"Wright\". Wait, I mean, you're wrong. My name is \"Wright\". Ini: \"Smith\", \"Wright\"... Well, I got, like, three letters, at least. Phoenix: (I don't think she gets the point...) Anyway, why are you here? Ini: So, like, I study this thing called \"parapsychology\" at this college and... Phoenix: Um, you told me about that yesterday. The sesame allergy, too. What I'd really like to know is why you're still here today? Ini: Oh! So, like, that's what you meant! Like, you shoulda been more, like, clear about it! Phoenix: S-Sorry. My bad. Ini: No, it's OK. Like, it's really... Phoenix: ... Ini: ...? Phoenix: ...That's it? Why'd you stop mid-sentence!? Ini: Did I? ...So, like... what was I talking about again...? Phoenix: ... (If Lotta ever wanted another \"genuine mysterious phenomenon\", it's right here.) Examine Wooden bear sculpture Phoenix: It's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. \"Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling\" What the!? It's a souvenir. Ini: Isn't it cuuuuute? I, like, totally bought that! Phoenix: Ah... so it's yours, huh? Ini: Yeah. So, like, this village is really famous for, like, channeling and bears. Phoenix: Heh. (...Wait. Famous for bears!?) Ini: But it's, like, OK. If you ever, like, see a bear, you just play dead, and they, like, leave you alone. Phoenix: I-Is that right? Ini: Yeah. Cause, like, fighting back is totally of no use. Phoenix: (Has she actually tried to fight one!?) Yellow box Phoenix: Hmm, now where did this box come from? I'm sure this wasn't here last night. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom. Talk Ini Miney Phoenix: So? Why are you still here today? Ini: Like, there's so much for me to, like, study here! Phoenix: Like what? Ini: Like, the medium's training, or like, how they inherit their spiritual power. Phoenix: (I suppose... This village is the real thing, after all.) Ini: So, like, I asked if I could stay here for, like, a little longer. Phoenix: (She sure seems like the care-free type, at least, on the surface...) What happened Phoenix: Have you heard about the murder? Ini: It's, like, totally scary. Phoenix: (...she says, with a silly smile plastered on her face...) ...So do you know anything about it that might help? Ini: ... Phoenix: (Somehow, I don't think she has a grip on reality, let alone what's going on here.) The victim Phoenix: About the victim, Dr. Grey... Ini: I don't know who you're talking about. ...Like... Wait, I think you asked about him, like, yesterday, too... Phoenix: (That's right... Her reaction yesterday when I asked was...) Phoenix: You and Dr. Grey knew each other, right? Ini: ...! I don't know any Dr. Grey! Phoenix: Oh really...? Then what was all that talk about him earlier? (Changed from [That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...] in the original release) Ini: Huh!? ...Well, uh... Like, a long, long time ago... I was, like, a patient, yeah. Phoenix: (OK, she is definitely hiding something from me...) Ini: ...Like, is something wrong? Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Would you take a look at this? Ini: Hey! It's, like, one of those little badges people in Congress all wear... Phoenix: No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. L-A-W-Y-E-R!! Ini: ...? Like, so is that what you are? Maya's Magatama Ini: Wow! It's a Magatama! Aww, you shouldn't have! Phoenix: It's so totally not for you! Ini: Hey! Like, it's not nice to freak me out like that! Phoenix: (That should be my line...) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about this girl... Ini: Oh, that's, like, Maya Fey. She's, like, the Master's daughter. Phoenix: You surprise me. You knew that? Ini: Well, like, I totally know everyone related to the occult. Maya is, like, an idol among spirit mediums. Phoenix: (Maya an idol? I guess stranger things have happened.) Morgan Fey profile Ini: That's Morgan Fey. Like, she's been totally helpful. Phoenix: (Did she just bow to the picture...?) Ini: So what about her? Phoenix: Oh, nothing in particular. I just wanted to know what you knew about her. Ini: Um... Well, she's, like, a really good person. Phoenix: I see. Ini: Like totally. Phoenix: OK. (This is going nowhere...) Ini Miney profile Ini: Um... This face... Like, I think I've seen it somewhere before... Phoenix: What!? ...Y-You're joking, right? Ini: Ha ha, like, of course I am, silly! Phoenix: (Oh, thank goodness...) Any other evidence Ini: Like, I'm really sorry, but... And I know, like, you totally had your heart set on it, but I can't, like, take it. Phoenix: (Who said anything about giving this to you!?) Any other profile Phoenix: What do you know about this person...? Ini: I'm, like, sorry, but it's totally, like, time for my nap... Phoenix: *yawn* (Ack! She's even got ME yawning!) Ini: And I, like, totally don't care about that person anyway... After clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber, and clearing \"The victim\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Side Room: June 20Fey ManorWinding Way Pearl: ... Phoenix: Ack! Y-You surprised me! Pearl: ... Phoenix: And how are you today? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Hmm... I guess she isn't open to friendly chatting... Huh? She's still holding something in her hand... ...It looks like the same thing she had yesterday...) Talk Any option Phoenix: Um... Pearl: Aaaah! Phoenix: H-Huh?? (If only I had something that would catch her interest. Maybe then she'd talk to me.) Present Maya's Magatama Leads to: \"Oh yeah. Maya said to give this to you...\" Anything else Phoenix: Can you take a look at this? Please? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Urk... She's really scrutinizing my face...) Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Th-That's enough already! I'm not that shifty-looking, am I!?) Phoenix: Oh yeah. Maya said to give this to you... Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Ack! I'm in trouble now!! If Morgan sees us like this, I'll be the next one they're channeling...) Pearl: Th-That's... That's Mystic Maya's... Phoenix: ...Huh!? (Sh-She actually spoke!) Pearl: Who are you...? Phoenix: I-I'm Phoenix Wright. I, uh, worked with Maya... Pearl: ...Y-You worked with Mystic Maya...? You... You're Mr. Nick, right? Phoenix: ...Uh, excuse me? (I bet I know who she picked \"Nick\" up from...) Pearl: I know who you are. You're... You're Mystic Maya's... \"special someone\"... Phoenix: WH-WH-WH-WHAT!? Pearl: So then... Of course! You're going to help Mystic Maya, aren't you? That's what you're going to do, right? Phoenix: W-Well, yeah... I will... Pearl: Oh wow... It's like a beautiful fairy tale! That earnest look shining brightly in your eyes... It must be true love... Phoenix: ...Wh-What!? (Why am I being boiled into a bright red lobster by this little kid!?) Pearl: I'm so jealous of Mystic Maya! Ah, what a wonderful relationship... Phoenix: W-Wait... I... uhh... I mean... We aren't... Things aren't like... Pearl: Hee hee, I can tell you're a good person. Alright, Mr. Nick! I may be small, but I'm going to help you in any way I can! Talk Pearl Phoenix: Pearl, are you friends with Maya? Pearl: I feel very grateful to be friends with her... She's so great. I want to be like Mystic Maya when I grow up. I really look up to her. Phoenix: Wow, I had no idea Maya was so... revered. Pearl: Usually when people don't use Mystic Maya's title, I get mad. Phoenix: O-Oh, sorry. Pearl: But if it's you, Mr. Nick, then it's OK. Because... Because... you're \"special\" to her. Phoenix: (Where in the world did she get an idea like that??) Pearl: By the way... this may be rude, but which channeling school are you from? Phoenix: Which channeling school? Pearl: Yes. For example, I study the Kurain technique. Phoenix: ... Ah, I get it! No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. A lawyer. Pearl: ...Law...yer? Phoenix: Yup. Pearl: ...Is that related to spirit mediums in any way...? Phoenix: (Um... None that I know of...) Wait, are you telling me you don't know what a lawyer is? Pearl: I'm sorry, but I have no idea. Phoenix: (Maya did say Pearl doesn't know much about the outside world...) The item in your hand Phoenix: So what's that you've got there, Pearl? Pearl: Oh, this? I found it yesterday. Phoenix: Hmm... Pearl: If you want it, I can give it to you. Accept it Leads to: \"Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me...\" Don't accept it Phoenix: I can't take something this important from you, Pearl. Pearl: Oh... Phoenix: (But I'm sure I've seen that key somewhere before... ...and it might be an important clue later on...) Leads to: \"Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me...\" Phoenix: Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me... Pearl: Hee hee. You look like a child at a toy store, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (...She not only speaks in a refined manner, but laughs in one, too!) Black Key added to the Court Record. Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: So this is... Pearl: That is Mystic Maya's Magatama. It's one of the most important heirlooms of Kurain Village. Please make sure to take good care of it. Phoenix: Y-Yeah, I will. (Is it really OK for me to have such a priceless object?) Folding Screen Pearl: Are you interested in Kurain's traditional things too, Mr. Nick? The Kurain Sacred Writings are on this folding screen. Phoenix: Oh? Is that what's written on it? Actually, what caught my eye was this \"hole\" in it... Pearl: It's a very old screen, so I think that maybe bugs made it by eating through it. Phoenix: (...It sure doesn't look like something bugs can make...) Black Key Phoenix: About this key... Pearl: I found it while I was playing in the garden yesterday. Phoenix: I've seen it before too, you know? Pearl: ...? Really? Maya Fey profile Pearl: I look up to Mystic Maya a lot. She's my role model. She's so smart, and pretty, and kind, and loving. She's always cheerful, never gets sick, isn't picky, and has good sleeping habits. She always wakes up before me, and always eats breakfast before me too. And she has you; such a wonderful person with whom she can share a lo- Phoenix: Ack! OK, OK! I get the idea! (She really thinks the world of Maya, doesn't she?) Pearl Fey profile Pearl: To tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother won't let me. Phoenix: Your hair now suits you quite well, though, I think. Pearl: R-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget* Phoenix: *fidget, fidget* Morgan Fey profile Pearl: Oh, it's my mother! She takes really good care of me and loves me very much. She says I'm the \"pride of the branch family\"... But I don't know what that means. Phoenix: (\"Branch family\"... That concept is probably still too hard for little Pearl...) Any other evidence Pearl: I'm sure it is helpful to you in some way, but I'm still in training, so I don't know anything about it. I'm really, deeply sorry. Phoenix: No, no, no, it's OK. I shouldn't have shown you something so trivial anyway. I'm very sorry. (This feels so weird, talking to a kid like this...) Any other profile Pearl: Hmm, I'm sorry I don't know who this person is. Phoenix: I guess that makes sense... You've never left Kurain village, after all. Pearl: I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick. I just don't really know anyone outside the village. After clearing all Talk options: Pearl: Um, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: Yes, Pearls? I can call you that, right? You're too cute to just call you Pearl. Pearl: Sure, Mr. Nick... Umm... Are you sure it's OK for me to have this Magatama? Phoenix: Yeah, it's OK. I was told to give it to you. Pearl: But, I can't accept something like this! ...All I really should do is charge this Magatama with spiritual energy... Phoenix: Spiritual energy? Pearl: Please take this. I'm sure it will be helpful. Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Pearl: It will let you see people's secrets. Phoenix: See people's... secrets...? Pearl: Yes. ...If it's alright with you, I would like to accompany you for a little while. I can explain the Magatama's power to you when we meet someone hiding a secret. June 20Fey ManorMeditation Room Gumshoe: Hey, it's you, pal! So you're going to be her lawyer, I bet. Phoenix: Yes. Gumshoe: Oh... I really feel bad for you, pal. Just this once, I wish I could be on your side. Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Yeah, but I shouldn't be saying that kind of stuff to you. Hey! You're a cute kid. Pearl: ... Gumshoe: Ha ha ha. I'm not scary. Honest! Phoenix: (Wow, I never knew Gumshoe liked kids...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! I know! I'll show you something cool! How's this? It's a real, genuine pistol... Phoenix: D-Detective Gumshoe!! What are you doing showing her something that dangerous! Gumshoe: Oh, sorry... Talk Maya's guilt Phoenix: What about Maya and the charges against her? Gumshoe: I don't think you can win, pal. If you're talking about proof, we've got a few pieces. Phoenix: You've got proof...? Gumshoe: Yeah, pal. That puffy-haired photographer's going to testify tomorrow. Phoenix: (He must be talking about Lotta. Actually... speaking of Lotta...) Lotta: I took some hot pictures earlier! Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: Remember!? I took some pictures at the murder scene inside! Phoenix: (Lotta's \"hot pictures\"... I wonder what her camera captured...?) Gumshoe: ...Besides, you must've realized by now, pal. There's no way anyone other than Maya Fey could've done it. Phoenix: (...!) Pearl: ... Phoenix: (What am I supposed to say to Pearls now...?) The victim Phoenix: About Dr. Grey... Gumshoe: The victim wasn't super famous, but people still knew who he was. His face was all over those tabloid shows last year. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Gumshoe: I was looking through some newspapers from last year, and... ... Huh? I could've sworn I had... I cut an article out, but I guess I must've lost it... Phoenix: (He's searching through his pockets... And boy, are those big...) Gumshoe: Hmm... It looked really interesting, too. Hey, do you have a copy, pal? Phoenix: (A copy of that article...? I think Dr. Grey might have brought a copy to the office when he came by...) Tomorrow's trial Phoenix: About Maya's trial tomorrow... Gumshoe: I've got two pieces of news for you, pal. Phoenix: Two? Gumshoe: Yeah. \"Bad news\" and \"even worse news.\" So which do you want to hear first? Phoenix: ...I don't really care... It doesn't change the fact that I'm not going to like it. Gumshoe: Alright, pal. Well, the prosecutor for the trial is Prosecutor von Karma. Phoenix: WHAT!? Von Karma!? Phoenix: (Manfred von Karma... He was an awe-inspiring veteran prosecutor. He never lost a case in the 40 years of his career, and he raised a fearsome disciple. The horrible aftertaste of the evil he force-fed me is something I'll never forget.) Phoenix: ... Wait a sec. But didn't Von Karma stand trial and... Gumshoe: That's where the other piece of bad news comes in... The Von Karma you're facing tomorrow is actually his successor... Phoenix: Successor...? Successor (appears after \"Tomorrow's trial\") Phoenix: So, um... Who is this \"successor\" to Von Karma? Gumshoe: Literally, pal, it's Prosecutor von Karma's kid. His kid became a prosecutor real young... like 13, and hasn't lost a trial since. That's what they call a \"prodigy,\" pal. Phoenix: Hmm... Kid, huh... ... W-W-Wait a sec! Th-Th-Thirteen!? The kid became a prosecutor at the age of THIRTEEN!? I mean, a prodigy like that... I would have heard something about... Gumshoe: Oh, no, no. The kid was born and raised in Germany, pal. That country's got a lot of stuff and is a great place to develop a person's talents. Phoenix: (Germany, huh? That's probably why I've never heard of this person. Ugh... Still, all it takes is someone mentioning the name \"Von Karma\", and I get terrible flashbacks to that case. Stop it! Get a grip on yourself, Phoenix! (Changed from [Stop it! Get over it, Phoenix!] in the original release) None of that matters anymore... now that he's gone... (Changed from [That person is already gone...] in the original release)) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Pearl: Uh, um... Mr. Nick? Phoenix: What is it, Pearls? Pearl: I was wondering if I could see it, too? Phoenix: Ah, no, it's OK. It's not that important anyway. Maya's Magatama Phoenix: What do you think about this...? Gumshoe: Hey, that's a pretty nice-looking brooch! You should stop wearing that ugly old attorney's badge, and start wearing that, pal. Pearl: Hee, hee. That detective is so nice! Aren't you happy, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (Happy?... About what?) Newspaper Clipping 1 Phoenix: Um, Dr. Grey brought this over to my office the other day, and... Gumshoe: Hey! It's that news story! The one about the malpractice suit! Phoenix: Fourteen patients died and it caused a huge stink. Gumshoe: Yeah, but that's not all, pal. Things only got worse after that. Phoenix: You mean the car accident the nurse died in? Gumshoe: ...Hmm... Oh, here we go. I brought my own clipping with me today. Here, pal, this is for you. Phoenix: Alright. Thanks. Newspaper Clipping 2 added to the Court Record. Newspaper Clipping 1 (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The nurse that killed the patients ended up getting killed in an accident. Dr. Grey wound up on a lot of tabloid shows because of that. Now, there was a smart man. I'm sure that was a great way to advertise for his clinic. Phoenix: (Uh, huh. Scaring people off is always the best way to get more patients.) Black Key Phoenix: So about this key... Gumshoe: Hey, is that your house key or something, pal? Phoenix: Come on, does this look like a house key to you? Gumshoe: Then what's it for? Phoenix: It's... ... (Hmm, actually, I should probably keep that a secret...) It's my bicycle key. Gumshoe: Oh. Nothing special, huh? Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: I'm sorry things had to turn out this way, pal. Phoenix: It's too early to give up! No one's proven her guilty of anything, yet! Gumshoe: Look, even if there were a zillion of you, pal, this is a case you... *sigh* Phoenix: (Now why is he sighing?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Oh, so that's little Pearl. Phoenix: Do you know her? Gumshoe: Only that Ms. Fey was looking for her earlier. Something about being worried that she'll end up talking to the weird guy. So, you have any idea who this \"weird guy\" is, pal? Phoenix: ...Nope. Not a clue. Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: That's Maya's aunt, right? I got to eat one of her giant strawberry desserts earlier. It was really good! Phoenix: (Aw, I didn't get to eat one yet...) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Boy do I look scary in this picture. I guess if I want people to stop thinking cops are scary, I have to change myself. Gotta smile, gotta smile! Phoenix: (There's that classic Gumshoe goofy smile again...) Any other evidence Gumshoe: Ooh, I'd better shut my mouth. Phoenix: Uh, what? Gumshoe: I'm not gonna give you any information about evidence, pal. Phoenix: Oh. Any other profile Gumshoe: I don't have anything to tell you about this one, pal. Phoenix: You don't have to be so mean about it. Gumshoe: Not. A. Word. Pearl: ... Gumshoe: H-H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Phoenix: (That girl has one intense stare... *gulp*) June 20Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: Hello again. We seem to be seeing a lot of each other today. Ini: Aww, she's, like, tooootally cute! Is she, like, your daughter? Phoenix: W-What!? NO! (How old do you think I am!?) Talk The victim Phoenix: I want to ask you about the victim, Dr. Grey. Ini: I, like, totally don't know him. 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: Aaack! What is that!? Ini: ...? Pearl: You can see it, can't you, Mr. Nick? You can see the \"lock\" on that person's heart. Phoenix: Huh, what...? Pearl: This is the power of the Magatama. Only you can see these \"Psyche-Locks\", Mr. Nick. Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks, huh...) Pearl: The more someone wants to hide their secret, the more locks you will see. If it's only one, I think you can easily unlock it. Phoenix: \"Unlock\"...? But how? Pearl: Please use Mystic Maya's Magatama on this person, and let's remove the lock. Phoenix: (I have no idea what she's talking about, but... Guess I'll give it a try.) Pearl: You must be careful, though, Mr. Nick. If you make a mistake, it will hurt you. If you don't think you have the proof you need, you must have the courage to stop. Phoenix: (Well, I've got to start somewhere. Let's give this Psyche-Lock thing a try.) The victim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Iim going to ask you again. Did you know Dr. Grey? Ini: I totally don't know that guy. Like, you're totally more presistent than a roach! 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (This girl is hiding something! I'm sure of it! I guess I have no choice but to remove this lock. Alright, so first, I have to use Maya's Magatama...) The victim (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Leads to: \"Please, tell me all you know about Dr. Grey.\" Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- The Victim -- Phoenix: Ini Miney. I believe you do know who Dr. Grey is! Ini: I told you! Like, how many times do I, like, have to repeat myself? If you're, like, so totally sure, then where's, like, your proof? Phoenix: While it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person, I do believe you might have at least, indirectly known of him. Ini: Like, what do you mean, like, \"indirectly\"...? Phoenix: (I should try to show that the possibility existed for now...) (Hmm, so, something that shows a possible connection between Ini and Dr. Grey...) Present Newspaper Clipping 2 Phoenix: Leads to: \"Take a look at this newspaper clipping.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here is your proof! Ini: Like, what is that...? Phoenix: Ouch... I guess it doesn't have anything to do with it, huh? (Pearls did warn me... \"If you make a mistake, it will hurt you,\" she said. If I don't have enough evidence, I should probably \"stop\". I should take another look at the Court Record and think it through one more time.) Leads back to: \"While it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person,\" Phoenix: Take a look at this newspaper clipping. Ini: Like, what is it? ... A story about an accident? Phoenix: Please read the victim's name. Ini: Um...\"Mimi Miney\"... Phoenix: \"Miney\" is a pretty rare last name, wouldn't you say? Ms. Mimi Miney wouldn't happen to be a relative of yours, would she? Ini: ...! So you noticed. Sh-She was my older sister. Phoenix: I'm sorry about your loss... Your sister... Was she a nurse... Perhaps at Dr. Grey's surgical clinic? Ini: ...! Phoenix: Grey Surgical Clinic... I don't think I need to tell you that the clinic was run by the victim, Dr. Turner Grey. Which is how you knew of Dr. Grey; you knew him through your sister! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Phoenix: Please, tell me all you know about Dr. Grey. Ini: My... My sister's name was Mimi Miney. She was, like, a nurse at Dr. Grey's clinic. Phoenix: (That's what I thought...) Ini: I heard that, like, Dr. Grey was really tough on people. Like, a total slave driver. My sis was, like, always coming home totally wiped out 'cause she was overworked. Phoenix: Wiped out? So is that why she fell asleep at the wheel? Ini: That guy, like, drove my sis so hard, so, like, that's why the accident happened. Phoenix: The one where 14 patients died from malpractice? Ini: Yeah, like, I think that was the doctor's fault, too. My sis was pushed by, like, everyone's expectations and, like, her duties and stuff. And that pushed her to her death. Phoenix: Oh... I'm sorry... Ini: So, like, are we done? I've, like, already told my story to, like, everyone... Pearl: Do you understand now, Mr. Nick? This is how a Psyche-Lock works. Phoenix: ...Well, I don't plan to pry into people's hearts unless I absolutely need to... Pearl: The lock this time was pretty easy, but... you might meet people who aren't as willing to give in later on. If you don't have enough proof, be careful and know when to stop trying. After clearing \"Successor\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Meditation Room and clearing \"The victim\" Talk option upon breaking Psyche-Lock in Fey Manor - Side Room: June 20Kurain Village Pearl: Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Hmm? What's wrong? Pearl: I have never left Kurain Village. Phoenix: R-Really? Wow, that's, um, pretty amazing... Pearl: You are going to meet with Mystic Maya... aren't you? Please tell her I said hi. Phoenix: Hey, wait! (She ran off... Again. Well, I know Ini's secret now, but... I still don't have any idea how I'm going to save Maya. I don't even know if I should go in there with a smile or a straight face... *sigh*) June 20Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (What am I supposed to do!? I'm almost out of time! Can I really do anything? Can I really save her...?) ???: Sorry to keep you waiting. Phoenix: (Huh? Must be Maya...) ???: It's been a long time, hasn't it, Phoenix? Phoenix: ...! (That voice...) M-Mia! Mia: Even without me being here, it looks like you've learned to stand on your own. Phoenix: (Mia... She's Maya's older sister, and my mentor. She was a top-notch defense lawyer, but a certain case forced her into \"retirement\". But... whenever I'm in trouble, she comes to help, just like this. Her spirit comes back from the other world and borrows Maya's body for a bit...) Mia: Phoenix, you can't make that kind of face in front of your client. Phoenix: ...! Mia: A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets, and especially when it's bad. Phoenix: Mia... Mia: You can't smile at the end if you haven't been smiling the whole way there. In any case, the face you're making now is no face to show a client, Phoenix. Phoenix: B-But! Mia: So, tell me all about it. I'm going to guess that my sister is in a lot of trouble again... Phoenix: (I told her everything about what had happened in the last two days. Mia closed her eyes, deep in thought, while she listened...) Mia: ...I see... Phoenix: Mia... What am I supposed to do? Mia: ... It's pretty clear what a good lawyer does in this situation. Phoenix: A-And that is!? Tell me, please! Mia: Believe in your convictions. And fight for the complete acquittal of your client. Talk Not guilty Phoenix: You think Maya's not guilty!? How can you be so sure!? Mia: I know she is. And I'll give you a hint as to why. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: Mediums can't have dreams. Phoenix: Can't have \"dreams\"...? Mia: From what you told me, it sounds like Maya was having a dream while channeling. Phoenix: Yeah... She said she dream that she had died and had been buried in the ground. Mia: But that is impossible. You've heard it from her, I'm sure. When a medium channels, her own spirit disappears. Which means that it's impossible for her to dream during that time. Phoenix: ...! Then... What does this mean!? Mia: I think it's safe to bet that Maya was set-up. Phoenix: A set-up!? Mia: It's up to you to blow the lid on this case tomorrow and show how she was set-up. Evidence? Phoenix: How am I supposed to prove her innocence when I have nothing to go on!? Mia: If you're looking for a clue, it's already in your hands. Phoenix: I-It is!? Mia: Just as it sounds, Phoenix, you already hold the \"key\". Phoenix: (R-Really...?) Mia: Come on, show me the \"key\" to this case. Phoenix: (The \"key\", huh? Alright, I'll show it to her; the \"key\" I hold.) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Mia... Mia: *chuckle* Wow, this badge brings back a lot of memories, doesn't it...? I would love to stand with you at the defense table one more time. Phoenix: (Mia...) Maya's Magatama Mia: This is... Maya's Magatama, isn't it? Why do you have it...? Phoenix: Maya gave it to me, but... Mia: I see... ... This is something very important to me. Take good care of it, OK? Phoenix: (She looks at it with such a soft look in her eyes...) Black Key Phoenix: Mia, have you seen this key before? Mia: Ahh, the key... It's literally, the key to understanding everything that's happened in this case. Phoenix: This key? Mia: Phoenix, listen. Right now, that key is sitting in your hand. However, it shouldn't be. ... It contradicts the \"facts\". Phoenix: (What does she mean...?) Mia: I'm certain this key will be the piece of evidence that makes your case tomorrow. Maya Fey profile Mia: I can't see Maya... when I'm in her body like this... But I can tell. She's very lonely and sad. Take good care of her, will you, Phoenix? Phoenix: I-I will... Pearl Fey profile Mia: Pearly! She's really grown up... I left Kurain Village a long time ago. She probably doesn't remember a thing about me by now... Morgan Fey profile Mia: I'm afraid I might have caused Aunt Morgan a lot of stress. When I left Kurain, I left Maya in my aunt's care. And now something like this happens... Dick Gumshoe profile Mia: I've seen this man somewhere before... He had a strange name... and I'm almost sure I've questioned him before. I remember him making a show of confidence at first, but after five minutes, he breaks down and... ...you end up feeling bad for the poor guy... Mia Fey profile Mia: That's right. I'm already dead. But I feel very grateful to have been born a Fey... so I can talk with you like this... Any other evidence Phoenix: Could you take a look at this? Mia: ...Do you have anything more useful? There's no time left. Try to show me something that will help you in tomorrow's trial. Any other profile Mia: I'm sorry, but I don't remember who that is... After clearing all Talk options and presenting Black Key: Mia: ... ... You already know everything you need to know. You know what the \"key\" to this case is... That is enough... Phoenix: But... But! How can I win tomorrow without knowing who the real murderer is!? Who... Who could have...? Mia: ... Phoenix: (I didn't know it at the time, (Changed from [At the time, I didn't know,] in the original release) but this day was going to end with a turn for the surprising...) 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: M-Mia!? Wh-What...!? Mia: What's wrong? Phoenix: (That's right. Only I can see the Psyche-Locks... Which means... Mia must know something about the real murderer! But for this to be something that she would hide under lock and key from even me... What in the world is going on!?) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!) Reunion, and Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 June 21, 9:48 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Maya: Whaaaaaaaat!? Prosecutor von Karma!? You mean...? Phoenix: No, I heard it's his successor this time... Maya: Successor...? ... Manfred von Karma... was a really sinister man. (Changed from [Manfred von Karma. He was a really sinister man.] in the original release) He pulled all sorts of nasty tricks; all so he could win. Phoenix: (He was a man obsessed with the word \"perfection\"... He had a perfect record... for forty long years. Who knows what sorts of dirty tricks he used to get each of those guilty verdicts? And now, his successor... I wonder what kind of person they will turn out to be...) Maya: It's no good... Mystic Maya!! Maya: Pearly! You showed up! Thanks for coming all this way! Pearl: I was really worried about you... Maya: Hey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together? Pearl: Mother is watching over the trainees. She said they have training for two days straight with no breaks. Maya: Huh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself? Pearl: Yup! I snuck out of the manor and followed a map. Phoenix: Don't tell me you walked all the way here... Pearl: Of course not! ...I ran! Phoenix: That's... I can't... Oh my... (If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...) Maya: Pearly... What about the train? Pearl: Huh? What's a... \"tray-in\"? Phoenix: (I give up...) Pearl: ...It's time, isn't it? Maya: Um... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma! Pearl: Mr. Eh-ji-werth? Who is that? Maya: Um, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend. I still remember him as though I'd seen him only yesterday. (Changed from [I still remember him as if I had just seen him only yesterday.] in the original release) Every trial was a scorchingly fierce battle until the very end. (Changed from [Every trial was a scorching fierce battle until the very end.] in the original release) It was always back and forth with them. But when you're rivals for life... Phoenix: Maya! Please don't mention that name ever again... Maya: Huh...? But why, Nick? Phoenix: I'm... I'm sorry, Maya. I forgot you don't know... He... He's... He's gone... And he's not coming back... Maya: Whaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!? Bailiff: Court will commence shortly. Please proceed into the courtroom. Phoenix: ... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway. Maya: N...Nick...? June 21, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey. Are the prosecution and the defense prepared? ???: ... Phoenix: ... (What is with this kid...?) (Changed from [... (What is with this girl...?)] in the original release) Judge: ... *Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you prepared!? (Changed from [*Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you finally prepared!?] in the original release) Phoenix: Huh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. (Why does he always seem mad at me!?) ???: Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: ...! ???: You must be a little shocked because I am a woman, correct? Phoenix: (...Hold on. So SHE'S the famed \"successor\" to Prosecutor von Karma...?) (Changed from [...Hold on. So this kid is the 'famed' Prosecutor von Karma...?] in the original release) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: Revenge...? (Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?) Judge: Um... If it's something of a personal nature, I'm sure you can... Oww! von Karma: I'm talking. If you interrupt again, my whip will do the speaking for me. Phoenix: (Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...) Yeow!! von Karma: Make no mistake; I will defeat you! Prepare to go down, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Judge: Prosecutor von Karma, your opening statement, please... von Karma: Those of Von Karma blood have only one fate. And that is \"perfection\". The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch. Judge: V-Very well... What is the defense's position? Phoenix: Your Honor. Judge: Does the defense wish to enter a plea of \"not guilty\"? Phoenix: ...Yes. von Karma: Foolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the \"justified self-defense\" plea in no time. Phoenix: (\"Justified self-defense\"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of themself. (Changed from [A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself.] in the original release) We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of \"not guilty\", Your Honor! (Because to plead \"justified self-defense\" is to say you did kill someone.) von Karma: How foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness. Phoenix: (She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.) von Karma: Witness, your name and occupation? Gumshoe: Yes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!! von Karma: Get to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder. Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room. Judge: What were they doing in there? Gumshoe: Um... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir. Judge: Ch-Channeling a spirit?? Phoenix: (That's quite the look of disbelief there, Your Honor...) (Changed from [The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...] in the original release) Gumshoe: *ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room. Judge: Ah, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over. Floor Plans added to the Court Record. Judge: So, how was the victim killed? Gumshoe: I was about to get to that... von Karma: Stop wasting my time, then. Witness Testimony -- Cause of Death -- Gumshoe: The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir. The shot was fired from point-blank range. But before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest. The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death. The murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing. Judge: Hmm... So the victim was stabbed before being shot... Gumshoe: This is the victim's autopsy report, sir. Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: The court accepts it into evidence. Mr. Wright, you may question the witness. Cross Examination -- Cause of Death -- Gumshoe: The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The murder weapon, Detective Gumshoe. Whose pistol was it? Gumshoe: It was the victim's. Phoenix: The victim? Now, why would he have... von Karma: von Karma: \"Why would he have a pistol?\" Who cares? The point that you are missing is whose fingerprints are on that pistol. If you're not already paying attention to that, then I suggest you start. Judge: Fingerprints? There were fingerprints? Gumshoe: Along with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir. Judge: Hmm. So the defendant's fingerprints were left on the murder weapon... Phoenix: (Argh...! I walked right into her hands there.) (Changed from [Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.] in the original release) Gumshoe: The shot was fired from point-blank range. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Point blank, huh? So about how far away was it? Gumshoe: It was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away. Phoenix: And how do you know he was shot at point blank? von Karma: Tsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I grow tired of the foolish foolery of the foolish fools of this foolish country... Phoenix: E-Excuse me!? von Karma: Gunpowder burn. Phoenix: ...Gunpowder burn? von Karma: When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole. Gumshoe: Gunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead! Phoenix: (Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...) Gumshoe: But before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Stabbed... And what was he stabbed with? Gumshoe: A fruit knife. Judge: I see. And whose knife was it? Gumshoe: It looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it. Judge: Hmm... All over it, huh? Phoenix: (Urk. This does not look good...) von Karma: Ha ha ha. What will you do now, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Gumshoe: The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How severe was the wound? Gumshoe: If it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand. Phoenix: (This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...) Gumshoe: The murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure he was stabbed first, then shot? Gumshoe: Yup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal. von Karma: A fool is a fool who will only listen to the foolish opinions of other foolish fools... A pistol shot to the forehead at point blank is certainly enough to kill instantly. Does it matter, then, which was first? Think a little more before you open that big mouth of yours, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Grr... What a pain...) Phoenix: (Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...) After pressing first, second, third, and fifth statements: Judge: That's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered. Gumshoe: I brought the two murder weapons with me today. Judge: Very well. The court accepts them into evidence. Pistol added to the Court Record. Knife added to the Court Record. von Karma: The date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time. Judge: And two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them, huh... (Changed from [And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...?] in the original release) Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case. von Karma: Naturally! Phoenix: (This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...) von Karma: Your Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there? Judge: That is quite true... Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Judge: Even in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead \"not guilty\"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose. von Karma: See, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes... Judge: What will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to \"justified self-defense\"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance. Phoenix: (This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!) Plead justified self-defense Phoenix: (If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to \"justified self-defense\"... von Karma: Hah. Judge: Understood. Let the record show that the defense has entered a new plea. Phoenix: (...There's nothing else I could do... Mia...?) Mia: ...You already hold the key... ...If you don't believe, you cannot win... Phoenix: (...! If we plead \"justified self-defense\", we would basically be confessing to murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'll be labeled a murderer... Can I really... Can I really let that happen!?) Your Honor! Judge: Y-Yes? Phoenix: The defense... The defense retracts its previous statement. And instead, will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant is not guilty! Leads to: \"...You.\" Plead not guilty Phoenix: (If we plead \"justified self-defense\"... we would basically be confessing to a murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'd be labeled a murderer... I can't let that happen!) Your Honor! Judge: Have you reached a conclusion, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The defense will not change its plea. We will accept nothing short of complete acquittal! Leads to: \"...You.\" von Karma: ...You. You have sealed your fate, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Detective! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! von Karma: Present the final portion of your testimony -- the final strike. Gumshoe: Um... Y-Yes... sir... Judge: N-Now, see here! Proceedings are run by... Eek! von Karma: ... Judge: Oh, yes, of course. Go ahead Detective and give your testimony... von Karma: I think the court would like to hear about the other piece of incriminating evidence! Witness Testimony -- Incriminating Evidence -- Gumshoe: Sorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence. This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime. As you can see, it's covered in blood. The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back. Judge: So this is the costume... There certainly is evidence of a back spray of blood on this. Gumshoe: This piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir. Judge: I see... The court accepts this into evidence. Maya's Costume added to the Court Record. Judge: Alright, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??) von Karma: Hah. What's wrong? You seem to be at a loss. I think this is the last piece of testimony the prosecution should have to offer. Feel free to sulk off with your tail between your legs, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Please stop calling me by my full name. It's disturbing.) Cross Examination -- Incriminating Evidence -- Gumshoe: Sorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why didn't you say so in your testimony earlier!? Gumshoe: Uh... You're kinda scary today, you know, pal? Judge: Come now, Mr. Wright... There is no need for that kind of attitude in my court... Phoenix: ... Judge: A-Alright. Just, please stop glaring at me like that... Gumshoe: This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Maya's... costume? Gumshoe: Yeah. She was wearing this when we arrested her. Phoenix: (Maya... She's wearing her channeling costume today too... Is she not allowed to wear anything else...?) Gumshoe: As you can see, it's covered in blood. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: This blood on the costume... Gumshoe: Lab results show that it is the victim's blood. Judge: Hmm... So there is blood from the victim on the defendant's clothes. Phoenix: (Definitely not good...) (Changed from [Definitely not good... Urk.] in the original release) So, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence? (Changed from [Hmm, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Um, well... von Karma: von Karma: If you must change the topic, then the good detective here must testify again. But too bad. Not enough time. Let's move on. (Changed from [But too bad. Not enough time. Time to move on.] in the original release) Judge: Ah, yes, Ms. von Karma is perfectly correct... Phoenix: (Grr... Now even the Judge is on her side! But if I bite off more than I can chew here... What should I do!?) Press further Phoenix: (Why is Ms. von Karma suddenly putting up resistance? There must be a reason as to why she suddenly threw out an objection like that... There must be something about this costume...! (Changed from [There must be a clue somewhere on this costume!] in the original release) I just have to look harder!) Judge: Mr. Wright. Ms. von Karma's logic is perfect. There is no way for you to poke a hole in it. Phoenix: (Argh! Looks like my time is up. So, about the costume...) There is nothing wrong. Phoenix: (If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this. Judge: Good. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination There is one little thing... Phoenix: Your Honor. Actually, there is something very wrong with this piece of evidence. Judge: Wh-What!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about, pal!? von Karma: ... Judge: Wh-Where is this problem you are talking about!? Phoenix: (I've come this far... There's no turning back now!) The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here! Present bullet hole on left sleeve Phoenix: Leads to: \"I ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume.\" Present blood splatter Phoenix: Phoenix: The problem is obviously the blood splatter here! Judge: B-But... We've determined that the blood splatter is from the victim. Where is the problem in that? Gumshoe: Yeah, where, pal? Phoenix: Yeah... I wonder about that too... Judge: That last antic of yours just pushed me over the top, Mr. Wright. I hereby declare this cross-examination over... (Changed from [I am declaring that this cross-examination period is over...] in the original release) Phoenix: P-Please wait, Your Honor! (Ack! I'd better not mess up again...) Leads back to: \"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: There is a problem... somewhere around... here! Judge: Wh-What does he mean, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: There's nothing wrong with it. The only thing wrong here is the defense's head. Judge: Well said. You certainly do take after your father! Phoenix: (I've just been made to look like a fool again... Alright... Focus, Phoenix!) Leads back to: \"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\" Phoenix: I ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume. Judge: The sleeve? ...! There is a tiny hole here... Gumshoe: ..A... A hole...? But that wasn't in the report. Judge: Hold on! What's this around the hole? I-It smells faintly of gunpowder! Gumshoe: G-Gunpowder!? No one ever told me! Judge: A hole that smells of gunpowder... Phoenix: (It looks like I've found the \"hole\" I was looking for!) Your Honor, the only logical conclusion you can make is that it must be a bullet hole! Judge: Order! Order! Order!! This is a very grave matter. It's best we correct the Court Record first before anything else. Maya's Costume updated in the Court Record. Gumshoe: Sorry about that. I guess we messed up, sir. von Karma: ... Phoenix: ...! (I-Is she actually... smiling!? What else is she hiding!?) von Karma: Pull yourself together, Detective. That tiny \"hole\" doesn't change a thing. The strength of the evidence still holds. Continue with your testimony. That, just now, was a fluke. Nothing more. Phoenix: Phoenix: H-How can you say something like that!? This is a huge oversight! Judge: While I agree it is a mistake on the part of the police, what Prosecutor von Karma has said is true. The evidence still stands. If you do not find a more definitive problem with the evidence, then... Phoenix: No way!! Judge: Detective Gumshoe, please continue with your testimony. Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir. Leads back to cross-examination Let it go Phoenix: (If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this. Judge: Good. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Alright. I'll give you that the blood spatter is from the victim, but... what is this hole in the sleeve? Gumshoe: Um... Sorry, pal. We must've thought it was just a tear in the seam... Phoenix: Missing the hole is not what I'm asking you about. I'm talking about the hole itself! The smell of gunpowder  clearly gives away that... it is a bullet hole! von Karma: von Karma: As if little things like that matter. Phoenix: But they do. von Karma: A \"bullet hole\" in the sleeve, blood splatter all over the costume... Neither of these things can change the fact the defendant killed the victim. Phoenix: (...Grr... I know there's something more to that costume.) von Karma: Come now Detective. You're wasting precious time. Gumshoe: ... Yes, sir. Gumshoe: The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He wasn't \"fighting back\"? How do you know if he was or wasn't!? Gumshoe: We could find no evidence that the victim put up any sort of struggle, pal. Judge: Hmm... So did the murderer have a fight with the victim, or not? Depending on this, the circumstances around this murder change drastically. Phoenix: (Ugh... We're in real trouble now... If only I had something to prove that the victim did fight back...) Present Maya's Costume (after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Dick Gumshoe!\" Phoenix: (That Von Karma! She thinks she can decide the verdict with this testimony alone! I have to somehow find a critical contradiction and then I'll have her!) Phoenix: Detective Dick Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Y-Yes? Heh, having you call me by my full name is kind of a weird feeling... Phoenix: You said that my client killed \"a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.\" Gumshoe: Yeah, I did. Phoenix: Then what, may I ask, is the bullet hole you police overlooked supposed to mean!? Gumshoe: Eh, um... What does it mean? Phoenix: I'll tell you what it means. It means that the victim had fired off a shot. Is this what it means to \"not fight back\"? Gumshoe: A-Ah! You're right! Judge: It seems you are correct! (Changed from [It would seem that way!] in the original release) If the victim had tried to shoot the defendant, then... it would change everything... (Changed from [If the victim tried to shoot the defendant, then... It would change everything...] in the original release) Phoenix: (Alright! The wind seems to be shifting...) von Karma: Hah. Phoenix: (What is with that \"are you finished yet\" laugh?) von Karma: Are you finished yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Judge: Ms. von Karma? von Karma: It seems... that Maya Fey was shot at by the victim. However, that is only grounds enough to support a \"justified self-defense\" plea. Judge: That is correct. von Karma: But I'm sure you remember, Your Honor, what the defense clearly said. They rejected \"justified self-defense\" and pleaded \"not guilty.\" Phoenix: Ack! Gumshoe: Now that you... Judge: Why, that's right! von Karma: Which means! The defense has yet to prove anything at all! Phoenix: Nooooo!! Judge: W-Well... Yes, that's true... von Karma: Furthermore... just the fact that there is a bullet hole in the costume... is not enough to substantiate even a plea of \"justified self-defense\". Judge: Huh? How so? Gumshoe: Aaah! von Karma: Don't just stand there. Hurry up and tell the court what transpired that day. ...With the new information we acquired added in, of course. Gumshoe: Huh? You mean... By myself...? You want me to put together the scenario all by myself? Aah! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Right away, sir! Witness Testimony -- What Transpired -- Gumshoe: During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest. Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir. While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun. The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed. The defendant then picked up on the opening, took the victim's gun, and ended it... Judge: Hmm... This scenario you have put together does make sense... Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (On the surface, it does seem to make sense... (Changed from [Just by listening, it does make sense...] in the original release) However, I won't give up that easily!) Judge: P-Please refrain from glaring at me like that... Now then, your cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- What Transpired -- Gumshoe: During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: There is quite a difference in height between Dr. Grey and the defendant. Add in body strength, and it seems unlikely the defendant could have stabbed the victim! Gumshoe: Now that you mention it... Yeah, I guess... von Karma: von Karma: You think you can get away with such flimsy reasoning? Mr. Phoenix Wright! Maya Fey was in the middle of channeling, was she not? Phoenix: ...? von Karma: When channeling with the Kurain Channeling Technique, the medium physically changes. With the nurse's build, the defendant could have easily been a match for the doctor. Phoenix: (I don't believe it... She even studied up on the Kurain Channeling Technique!) von Karma: Like I said before... I am perfect. Judge: Um... Uh... About what you were talking about... I didn't quite get it... Phoenix: ... von Karma: ... Judge: Um, n-never mind. Let's continue with the testimony... Gumshoe: Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So he was stabbed, but the stab wound didn't kill him. Gumshoe: But if you think about the blood loss, it was pretty bad. Phoenix: How bad would you say it was? Gumshoe: Actually, I went to give blood the other day. And afterward, I felt a little lightheaded and dizzy. ...I guess the damage was maybe... about 10 times the dizziness...? Ack! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: S-Sorry! Gumshoe: While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where in the world did that pistol come from? Gumshoe: It looks like the victim, Dr. Grey had specifically bought it for that day. Phoenix: But a handgun...? Gumshoe: He got it off the black market about 2 days before the murder. Phoenix: (Why did Dr. Grey bring a gun...? Was he taking precautions against something...?) Gumshoe: The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you're saying that the bullet hole in this costume was made then? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal, but that's what I'd think. The two of them were already fighting when a shot was fired. Phoenix: (Maya... I'm really glad you weren't hurt...) von Karma: ... Present Maya's Costume Phoenix: Leads to: \"Missing the tiny hole on this costume...\" Gumshoe: The defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun, and ended it... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Maya has never fired a gun before in her life! Gumshoe: The victim had already taken off the safety. With the safety off, even an amateur like you can fire it by pulling the trigger. Phoenix: (Even me...? I wonder...?) von Karma: Now do you understand? A Von Karma's logic is perfect. Phoenix: (His testimony certainly makes us look very bad, but there's gotta be a contradiction in there somewhere... And uncovering it is going to uncover the truth! I can feel it!) Phoenix: Missing the tiny hole on this costume... will be the prosecution's undoing. Gumshoe: Eh? What do you mean? Phoenix: This little hole has actually created a huge hole in your testimony! Judge: E-Explain yourself, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: You said the two of them were fighting when the victim fired his gun at point blank. If that were true, then where is the gunpowder burn on this costume!? Gumshoe: G-Gunpowder... burn? Phoenix: This is what you testified earlier: \"When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\" Gumshoe: OH! Phoenix: But there is not a single trace of gunpowder burn on this costume!! Judge: That is a very good point. And... what exactly does this mean? Phoenix: It means that when the shot was fired, they were standing apart from each other. Judge: Hmm... von Karma: von Karma: I'm disappointed, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You think you can punch a hole in my logic with that? With wishy-washy thinking like that, anyone can explain anything away! Phoenix: Then I implore you to disprove my line of thinking. von Karma: Let's see... In the middle of their fight, the victim pushed the defendant away. And it was then, when they were separated, that he fired! How was that? Phoenix: Phoenix: As if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that! von Karma: ...! W-Well... Then... That's right! The defendant must have pushed the victim away! After stabbing him, she must have put some space between the doctor and herself. And then while she was preparing to strike again, the doctor took his shot. There. That sound satisfy even you. Judge: Hmm... That does make an awful lot of sense. What do you think, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (I must be careful. I can't afford to make a mistake here! Concentrate and think!) It makes sense. Phoenix: (Ack, it's no good. I can't find a \"hole\" in her logic at all this time...) I admit it. Somehow, your reasoning makes logical sense. von Karma: That's it. That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Drat. It's 11:00 AM. I've already missed my morning tea. ...However. At least we were able to arrive at a conclusion. Judge: Hmm... It does look that way. Phoenix: (...Oh boy... If I don't do something soon, it'll be curtains for Maya...) Judge: Well then, I think we can... Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! Please... Wait! Judge: Who was that? Mr. Wright? Please refrain from making unnecessary outbursts! Phoenix: (I don't care how, but I must find something to go on in Von Karma's explanation!) Leads to: \"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\" Something doesn't make sense. Leads to: \"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\" Phoenix: There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor! Gumshoe: Fatal...? Judge: Flaw...!? Yeow! von Karma: Very interesting. I would love to see where this \"flaw\" is! Show me something that contradicts my explanation! Phoenix: (There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere! \"She put some distance between them before rushing to make the final blow. And when she was about to strike, the doctor took his shot.\" There must be a piece of evidence that contradicts this line of thinking!) Present Folding Screen Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Take a look at this! Gumshoe: Why are you showing this to me, pal? Phoenix: Prosecutor von Karma's explanation and this piece of evidence... Gumshoe: ...Do not contradict! Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: Haha, looks like you need to use your brain a little more, pal. Phoenix: (Ugh... Being lectured by Gumshoe, of all people, is so embarrassing...) Gumshoe: Come on! Hurry up and get that thinking cap on! Leads back to: \"There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere!\" Phoenix: This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic. Judge: What is that? A folding screen? Phoenix: I would like to point the court's attention to the \"hole\" in this folding screen. von Karma: Aaah! Phoenix: It looks like you already know what I'm talking about. Gumshoe: Who? Where? What? Judge: Mr. Wright! Your explanation, please! Phoenix: (Are these two really that clueless...?) The bullet went through the defendant's sleeve first, then the folding screen. It passed through at a height of approximately 8 inches off the ground... Which means! When the shot was fired, Maya... I mean, the defendant, was not getting ready to strike, but was actually squatting low to the ground! Judge: Order! Order! Th-This changes everything! Phoenix: Please look at this diagram of the crime scene. The victim, Dr. Grey was here when he fired the shot. And the bullet hit this folding screen. It hit at this location, about 8 inches off the ground. At this time, the defendant was in this area. Present area directly in front of bullet hole Phoenix: Leads to: \"She was standing here, near the folding screen!\" Present area behind folding screen Phoenix: Phoenix: Here! Judge: Behind the folding screen...? Phoenix: Ack! von Karma: The victim and his attacker were fighting, were they not? Then what would the attacker be doing all the way back there!? Phoenix: Um... von Karma: Besides which, if the attacker was behind the folding screen, then how could the victim even know where to shoot? It's obviously impossible! Phoenix: ... Yeah, I guess so... Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Boy, did I just screw up royally... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.) Leads back to: \"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: Somewhere around here! Judge: ...? Phoenix: (Uh oh. The judge's face is scrunched like he just smelled some serious bad breath...) Uhh... Um... That is, I mean... Judge: Wait! I just realized I forgot to brush this morning... Excuse me while I freshen up. Phoenix: Uh, sure... Judge: In the meantime, I want you to think things through again, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Ah, of course... Whoops... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.) Leads back to: \"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\" Phoenix: She was standing here, near the folding screen! von Karma: W-Wait a second! We know the defendant was close to the ground based on the height of the bullet hole. But... How can you gauge the distance from that!? Isn't it possible that the defendant was standing much closer to the victim? Phoenix: That's impossible. von Karma: B-But why!? Phoenix: You, of all people, should know the answer to that question, Ms. von Karma. If she were shot from somewhere closer, there would be gunpowder burns present. However! There is nothing of the sort around the bullet hole of this costume! von Karma: Aaaaaah! C-Curse you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You...! Judge: Hmm... I believe it has now been proven that the defendant was standing a ways from the victim when she was shot at. But do you think this has changed the defendant's situation...? It doesn't change anything. Phoenix: (Hmm, even with that explanation, it feels like nothing has changed... But I can't give up just yet!) Leads to: \"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\" It changes everything. Leads to: \"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\" Phoenix: Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything! The prosecution has claimed that the defendant was aiming to kill by stabbing. If that were true, delivering the final strike with the knife would be ideal. However! Where and what was the defendant doing at the time...? Gumshoe: ...Squatting all the way by the folding screen...? Phoenix: Exactly. If Maya Fey was the real murderer, why would she be by the folding screen instead of preparing to strike? von Karma: Nnngh... Judge: Upon further consideration, it does make very little sense. Gumshoe: Yeah, I figured there had to be a reason. Phoenix: Figuring things out and proving the logic behind everything is YOUR job! Gumshoe: Oof... Phoenix: (Alright! With this, the rest of the trial should be in the b--) von Karma: ... Phoenix: (...blast radius of disaster.) von Karma: You are such a smart man, Mr. Phoenix Wright. To think that you've been able to take a completely hopeless case to this point... Now I know why Papa had a tough time with you. Mmm, you amuse me... Phoenix: (Uuugh. Of all the things to inherit, why did it have to be that smarmy smile!?) von Karma: Detective. How dare you damage my perfect logic!? Gumshoe: H-Huh!?... How is it all my fault?? von Karma: You can start repairing your standing by first removing that three-strand \"goatee\". Oh, and rest assured your punishment will come later. Gumshoe: ...P-Punishment... von Karma: Well then, Your Honor, I think I've had all I can take of this detective's face. I think it's time to call in the next witness. Phoenix: (Next witness...? That's gotta be Lotta!) Judge: Very well. The court will take a 5 minute recess. After we reconvene, we will hear from the next witness. To be continued. June 21, 11:37 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Phoenix: Phew, that was a close one. Maya: I know you were giving it your all to defend me. But I could feel the death penalty hanging in the air... Phoenix: I felt like I was pretty close to dying myself... Pearl: But you were wonderful out there. You listened carefully, made theories, and tricked everyone into believing you. Phoenix: Th-Thanks. Wait... Tricked?? Pearl: That must be the \"lawyer's\" secret technique, right? Maya: By the way... Is the next witness who I think it is...? Phoenix: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's Lotta Hart. Maya: Oh... Guess there's no escaping her, huh? (Changed from [Oh... Another jam, like always...] in the original release) Remember, Nick! You promised you'd save me! If you lose, me and my sis's ghosts will come after you and haunt you! (Changed from [If you lose, my ghost will come after you with my sis', and we'll haunt you!] in the original release) Pearl: Your sister...? Um, are you talking about Mystic Mia? Maya: Yeah. Do you remember her, Pearly? My sister was a super good lawyer! She was also Nick's teacher. Pearl: ...Oh, I didn't know that... June 21, 11:43 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2 Judge: Court will now reconvene. Now, the first order of... Oww! von Karma: I don't want to hear it, old man. After I call my witness, sit there quietly and watch like a good little boy. Judge: Y-Yes, sir. von Karma: Bring in the photographer who witnessed the channeling! von Karma: Witness. Your name and occupation, if you please. Lotta: Hey, Phoenix! How ya doin'? Phoenix: Just fine... Lotta: Sorry 'bout this. Didn't exactly have a choice, ya know...? Yeowza! von Karma: Name and occupation. Lotta: I-I declare! What in tarnation!? Hey, Judge! This here is violence against my fair self! Judge: That's fine. Lotta: \"That's fine!?\" That ain't fine!! That's a whip! Eaaah! von Karma: There's no need for foolish outcries from foolishly foolish fools. Just hurry up and testify about what happened on the day of the murder. Lotta: I haven't even gotten to say my name and job yet... von Karma: ... Lotta: The name's Lotta Hart, paranormal photographer, and I'm here to testify! Judge: Now, now, let's all be one big happy family... OK...? Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- Lotta: Only the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber. We were waitin' outside the door and then, \"bang!\" we hear this gunshot! Mr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room. Inside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around. I swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room. Judge: And did you take a picture of the scene right after the murder took place? Lotta: Reckon course! Phoenix: Eh? ...Excuse me? Lotta: Reckon course! It's short for \"Ya reckon!? Of course I did!\" Aah! von Karma: Does it look like I care? Just hurry up and show your picture to the court. Phoenix: (The moment of truth. What will be in that picture?) Lotta: Umm, let's see here... This here's the picture! Judge: Hmm... It would certainly seem that only the defendant and the victim were in that room. Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: Are you ready, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (I will clear all doubt about Maya through this cross-examination... Just watch me!) Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- Lotta: Only the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was it really only those two that went in!? von Karma: von Karma: What are you blabbering about!? You were there too, were you not!? Phoenix: Urk. von Karma: Why don't you answer that yourself? Was it really just the two of them? Phoenix: ...Yes. Dr. Grey and Maya were the only two who went into the room... Judge: H-Hold on! We can't have the defense testifying against its own client! Lotta: Anyway, folks, only the two of 'em went into the Channelin' Chamber, ya hear? von Karma: But you knew that from the very beginning, didn't you? ...Witness, continue. Lotta: We were waitin' outside the door and then, \"bang!\" we hear this gunshot! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was it really a gunshot!? von Karma: von Karma: Are you insane!? You must have heard it as well! Phoenix: Urk. von Karma: Why don't you testify for the court, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Was it really a gunshot? Phoenix: ...Yes. I think it was something that sounded like a gunshot... Judge: And why are we here listening to the defense testify!? Phoenix: (...And the world becomes just a little crueler...) Lotta: I heard a gunshot a long time ago, so I know. And I tell ya that was a gunshot I heard. Now, this -- this is where the story heats up! Lotta: Mr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, let me get this straight! This \"Mr. Lawyer there\" broke the door down!? von Karma: Honestly, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Why don't you tell us what happened, then? Phoenix: Um... Yes, Ms. von Karma... I broke the door down. Sorry. (Why does this feel like an inquisition?) Lotta: No need for apologizin'! That was great! You're a real man! Judge: Oh, really? That's something I would've liked to see. Phoenix: (The judge is smiling rather openly. I'll take that as a good sign...) von Karma: And? What did you see once you broke in? Lotta: Inside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure it was the defendant, Maya Fey!? Lotta: Sure, I'm sure! Phoenix: (Lotta seems awful confident in her testimony...) Press harder Phoenix: Lotta! Please, think back to that day one more time. Lotta: Wh-Whatcha getting' at? Phoenix: Remember what you said when we broke into the room...? ???: ...I was... murdered... *klik* Phoenix: Lotta! At a time like this!? Lotta: Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!? Phoenix: When you saw the murderer at that time, you couldn't even tell if it was Maya Fey or not! Am I correct!? Lotta: Ah, um, well, ya see... Judge: Order! Ms. Hart! You are here to present accurate testimony! Lotta: Yeah, ah, s-sorry. Phoenix: (Good. This shifts things back to my side...) von Karma: For a defense lawyer, your defense is terribly lacking, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: ! von Karma: Witness. Think back to when those two entered the Channeling Chamber. Lotta: When they entered...? von Karma: One of those people that entered the chamber was Maya Fey, correct? Lotta: Yeah, that's right! Phoenix: (Yeah... It was Maya that went in.) Judge: Hmm... It looks like we've come to a collective conclusion. The person in this picture is most certainly Maya Fey. von Karma: Exactly. Phoenix: (Rats! And I'm trapped like one... Again!) Leads back to cross-examination Leave her be Phoenix: (Even I can see that any normal person would know who that was. It's no good. I shouldn't push my luck on this...) Leads back to cross-examination Lotta: I swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain of that!? Lotta: Sure am! But that old witch chased us out of the room, so... Phoenix: (\"Old witch\"? Does she mean Morgan Fey?) Lotta: But there was no one else in there, and you know it! Phoenix: (The Channeling Chamber was very dark, almost pitch black... Was there really no one else in there? What about...?) behind the folding screen? Phoenix: What about... behind the folding screen? Did you check back there? Lotta: Reckgiven! Phoenix: Huh? What in the...? Lotta: Reckgiven! Ya know! \"Ya reckon!? That's a given!\" I took me a good look around the room once! There ain't no way anyone was hangin' out behind that foldin' screen! Judge: Hmm... If I may have a word with you, Ms. Hart... Lotta: Wh-What? Ya got a problem!? Judge: Reckgiven!... I mean, I am having a little difficulty in understanding you. If you would stop saying such things as \"Reckongiven\" and so forth... Aah! von Karma: Now then, Mr. Phoenix Wright, do you see a problem with the testimony or don't you? Leads back to cross-examination behind the door? Phoenix: What about... behind the door? Did you check there? Lotta: What do I look like to you? I wasn't born yesterday, ya know! First off, the one that bust that door open was you! With the way ya slammed that door, anyone standin' behind it woulda had more face and less nose, free of charge! von Karma: In any case, there was no one standing behind the door. Phoenix: (She actually had the police investigate that too!?) Leads back to cross-examination under the flooring? Phoenix: What about... under the flooring? Did you check there? Lotta: I ain't no ignoramus to make it out here! Phoenix: Huh?... Wh-What are you talking about? Lotta: Don't \"what are ya talkin' about\" me! Under the floorin'? C'mon!, even a bug wouldn't crawl under that! von Karma: Sorry to disappoint, but there was no secret passageway under the flooring. Phoenix: (Oh... Yeah, that was a bit far-fetched, huh...?) Leads back to cross-examination Phoenix: (Argh! Her story adds up... What's worse, I was there at the scene of the crime with her... (Changed from [What's worse is that I was there at the scene of the crime at that time too,] in the original release) and her story is exactly how I would have told it, too... (Changed from [and her story is exactly how I would have told it...] in the original release)) After pressing all statements: Phoenix: (Argh! Just as I thought, there is nothing wrong with her testimony! I was with her, so I know she's telling the truth...) Judge: Enough. It seems that there are no issues with Ms. Hart's testimony. von Karma: At the time of the crime, only two people were in the Channeling Chamber: the victim, Dr. Turner Grey, and the defendant, Maya Fey. Judge: Hmm... The face of the defendant can not be verified in this picture. However, if we think about the circumstances, it would have to be the defendant. Phoenix: (What am I going to do!? If I just let this go...) Judge: What is it, Mr. Wright? You look as if you have something to say... Phoenix: (If I make one wrong move, I'm going to have the judge against me... Is there anything I can present that would prove it's not Maya in that photo?) Present evidence Phoenix: Your Honor! Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: It is possible that the person in this photo is not the defendant! Judge: Wh-Wh-What!? Do you know what you are proposing!? Lotta: Y-Y-Yeah! That's just plain fool's talk! Phoenix: (Thanks guys. Your show of support was just great...) von Karma: ... Judge: ...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof. Prove to this court that the person in this photo is not Maya Fey! Present anything Phoenix: Phoenix: Here is your proof! von Karma: von Karma: ... Phoenix: Is there a problem? von Karma: Oh, no. I thought I would work on my inflections. Just wondering what an \"Objection!\" with a twist of \"You're wrong!\" sounds like. Judge: Mr. Wright. I'm sorry, but I don't follow your logic. Phoenix: (Shoot. I guess I wasn't showing enough confidence...) Present another piece Leads back to: \"...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof.\" Give up Leads to: \"Well, Mr. Wright?\" Can't present anything yet Leads to: \"Well, Mr. Wright?\" Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Nothing, Your Honor... von Karma: That's very smart of you, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You really should give up trying to prove this is not Maya Fey. Phoenix: (I didn't say anything about giving up! I just don't have the right piece of evidence to prove my argument...) Judge: That's enough! Phoenix: (I-Is this it...? Is this all I could do...?) Judge: I think it is quite obvious to this court that a verdict of not guilty is not possible. von Karma: I told you. Totally, 100% impossible. Judge: Ms. von Karma, do you have any further questions for this witness? von Karma: Having established the defendant's guilt, further questioning won't be needed. Judge: What about the defense? No further questions, I presume? Phoenix: (I... I couldn't protect Maya...) The defense... The defense... ...Phoenix... ...Phoenix, you can't make that kind of face... ...A lawyer is someone who smiles... no matter how bad it gets!... Phoenix: M-Mia! Mia: I guess I made it just in time, wouldn't you say? Phoenix: Y-You... But... P-Pearls! Mia: Her clothes ARE a bit small... Anyway, what are you waiting for, Phoenix!? Let's go! Phoenix: B-But how!? She's already taken away every advantage! Mia: The advantage is still in your hand! Think carefully, one more time, about what you saw in the Channeling Chamber. Do you remember what you told me yesterday? Phoenix: D-Dr. Grey!! *klik* ???: ...I was... murdered... Phoenix: W-What!? *klik* Phoenix: Lotta! At a time like this!? Lotta: Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! Mia: You see... There is one final piece to this puzzle. (Changed from [You see... There is one final piece of the puzzle.] in the original release) Phoenix: Mia...? Mia: Question Lotta one more time, Phoenix. I don't know if she's doing it unconsciously or on purpose, but... (Changed from [I don't know if she's doing it subconsciously or on purpose, but...] in the original release) she's not testifying truthfully. Judge: Now then, this court would like to end the cross-examination period. Phoenix: Phoenix: Please wait, Your Honor! The defense would like to request that the witness testify one more time. Judge: Overruled. I'm afraid you're too late, Mr. Wright. The cross-examination has already ended. Furthermore, any unrelated ques- Aah! von Karma: It's fine. I'll allow another testimony. A Von Karma's case is perfect. Absolutely flawless. And what better time than this for you to see that. Judge: B-But... I mean... I have some place I must go after this... Mmph! A-Al-Alright! I'll allow it! Ms. Hart! Hurry and give us another testimony! Lotta: Well... heck... What am I supposed to talk about? Phoenix: Please tell us once more, what happened when you burst into the Channeling Chamber. Lotta: OK! You got it! Mia: See, you got through to the judge somehow, right? Phoenix: (Well, actually it was Von Karma's whip that got through to him...) Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account, Pt. 2 -- Lotta: When we broke into that room, all I could focus on was Maya. I was... uh, kinda scared of the dead body, so I didn't take a good look at it. I'm really bad when it comes to blood and ghosts and stuff. But I still managed to point my camera at Maya and take a shot! Judge: Nothing sounds different from before... Phoenix: (Some parts of her testimony were very vague. I should press her on those sections!) von Karma: Struggle all you like as you taste the bitterness of your defeat. Well, amuse me with your useless questions, Mr. Phoenix Wright. I'm waiting... Cross Examination -- Witness' Account, Pt.2 -- Lotta: When we broke into that room, all I could focus on was Maya. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, what did she look like? Lotta: Ya know, she looked almost like a different person. Judge: A... A different person? von Karma: She may have seemed like a different person, however, she was still Maya Fey. We have already made that point abundantly clear! Judge: Yes, that is true... Well, then, Ms. Hart. Did you happen to see anything else? Lotta: I was... uh, kinda scared of the dead body, so I didn't take a good look at it. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Then perhaps that body was not Dr. Grey's at all! Lotta: Eh!? W-Well... I reckon that's possible... von Karma: von Karma: If the body inside that room was not that of Dr. Grey, then whose body was it, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: Well, what if it was that of Maya Fey after the channeling? Or maybe -- Oww! von Karma: Foolish fool spouting foolish foolishness, just as I expect of a foolish fool such as you. If that were the case, then that would mean that Maya Fey is, in fact, dead. And that would make the defendant's chair quite a lonely place, wouldn't it!? Phoenix: (Urk... Sorry, Maya...) Lotta: Are y'all done here? Can I continue? Lotta: I'm really bad when it comes to blood and ghosts and stuff. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And even knowing that, you still persist in being a paranormal photographer? Lotta: That's why I'm getting out of this here business. This gal's gonna get the dirt on the stars and be a tabloid photographer from now on! Phoenix: (She goes through jobs faster than a baby through diapers.) Wah! von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright. Would it kill you to stay on topic for a change? Judge: Well? Would it, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (Nice, tag-teamed in stereo. Guess I should be grateful it's not in 5.1...) Lotta: But I still managed to point my camera at Maya and take a shot! Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"Two, right?\" Mia: There must be something we can use in her testimony just now. We must find it! At all costs... Phoenix: Two, right? Lotta: T-Two what? Phoenix: Two shots. You took two shots. Judge: But... Only one has been submitted as evidence! Phoenix: Ms. Hart! Where is the other picture you have been withholding!? Lotta: No, no, no! You've got it all wrong! It's not me! I-I didn't mean anything bad! I know I can be a little mean, but I ain't evil! Phoenix: (Well, at least she knows herself...) Judge: Then why have you not shown this \"other picture\" to this court yet? Lotta: Well, ain't it obvious!? That prosecutor woman told me to shut my trap about it! Phoenix: W-What!? V... Von Karma!! Judge: M-M-Ms. von Karma! Y-Y-You... You're hiding critical evidence...! von Karma: ... Phoenix: (Unforgivable, von Karma. Suppressing evidence like this... You're as bad as your father!) Confront Franziska Phoenix: Your Honor! The defense asks that Prosecutor von Karma be held in contempt of court! Judge: Hmm... Well, yes... Mngh! von Karma: Me? In contempt of court!? You can't be serious. Phoenix: But... But you hid evidence from the court... On purpose! That's... That's... That's not fair! Mia: P-Phoenix!! Are you a lawyer or a school child? Phoenix: (Ack! I was so angry I lost my composure...) Leads to: \"Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?\" Leave it to the Judge Phoenix: (...Argh! I'm so mad that even my throat's clenching up! I'd better let the Judge handle this...) Leads to: \"Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?\" Judge: Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court? von Karma: I thought this picture was not important, and thus, felt no need to submit it. That's all. Phoenix: H-How could you think...!? von Karma: The pictures were more or less the same, so why bother with the second? I mean, it's just so much more trouble than it's worth for me to submit this as evidence. Phoenix: \"M-More trouble that [sic] it's worth!?\" How... How can you say that!? von Karma: If you want to see it that badly, I'll submit it. Lotta's Photo 2 added to the Court Record. Judge: ... Wh-What is...? What is this picture!? von Karma: It's obviously the second picture the witness took that day at the scene of the crime. Well, it's a little off-center, but that's what you get with a nervous amateur. Judge: Um... I think the important point here is the person in this picture! (Changed from [Well, I think the important point here is the person in this picture!] in the original release) This is most definitely NOT Maya Fey! What is the meaning of this!? Phoenix: (This might be the break I was looking for... Now, should I or should I not insist that the person in this picture is not Maya?) Drop the issue Phoenix: ... (It's no good. We've been through this so many times...) Judge: This is not like you, Mr. Wright! Why are you not objecting!? The person in this photo is clearly not the defendant and yet... von Karma: Ha ha ha... There is no way he can raise an objection and hope to live. Judge: Explain yourself! Leads to: \"Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture.\" Insist it's not Maya Phoenix: Your Honor! As you can plainly see, the person in the picture is not Maya Fey! Judge: Y-Yes, I see that... It's not just her face! Her whole body has taken on a different appearance! Phoenix: There is only one conclusion that can be drawn, then. That somehow, this other person snuck in and traded places with the defendant! Judge: Order! Order! Order!! Well, yes, I believe you are correct, Mr. Wright! The person who was inside the Channeling Chamber was not Maya Fey! Phoenix: Mia! We did it! Mia: ...You're too soft. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: You're softer than Aunt Morgan's strawberry desserts, Phoenix. Take a look at Prosecutor von Karma's face. Phoenix: (S-She's... smiling...!?) von Karma: I think you had better continue to worry, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Judge: M-Ms. von Karma! What do you mean by that? Leads to: \"Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture.\" von Karma: Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture. This was taken yesterday at the Detention Center's Visitor's Room. This is Mr. Phoenix Wright and the defendant, Maya Fey during his visit... Judge: Maya Fey? But... Isn't this a totally different person!? von Karma: She looks this way because she is obviously in the middle of channeling a spirit! Judge: It's unbelievable... That she can... von Karma: Yet, it is the truth. (Changed from [However, it is true.] in the original release) When Maya Fey is in that state, she physically changes into the person she's calling! Judge: ... Mia: Ms. von Karma. A word, if I may. (Changed from [I wonder if she knows what she's doing...] in the original release) Phoenix: (M-Mia!?) (Question mark not present in the original release) Mia: Taking pictures of someone during a private visit is illegal. Surely, you must know that that picture can't be submitted as evidence. (Changed from [That picture can't be submitted as evidence.] in the original release) von Karma: ... Obviously, I know this picture is illegal. (Changed from [Obviously, this picture is illegal.] in the original release) But I never intended to submit it as evidence in the first place! Phoenix: (Wh-What is she...?) von Karma: From the moment I showed this picture to the court, this case became all mine. After all, this image has now been forever burned into the judge's mind. Judge: ... Phoenix: (I... I don't have even a single witty line...) Mia: It looks like we've been had. Judge: I don't claim to understand this, and I still cannot believe it... Are you saying that this person... this person is the defendant, Maya Fey!? Phoenix: (If I give up here, the trial will end! But... If I slip up and say something wrong, it will cost me... Is there any way I can prove that the person in this picture is not Maya!?) I can't prove it. Phoenix: (It's no good! My argument doesn't hold any water!) Judge: I see the defense is staying silent on this one. Phoenix: ...Yes... Your Honor... von Karma: And to think. I even gave you this chance to prove your point for free. But you couldn't even point yourself out in a line-up! Judge: Hmm... Yes... Well, then. I believe we have reached a conclusion. Mia: Phoenix! Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: You can't give up! Please, for me? Take a look at the Court Record again and try to find some way out of this jam! Phoenix: Yeah... Some way... Mia: The judge is about to close the trial. You can't let that happen! Phoenix: (Argh... It's come down to this!) Your Honor! Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now. Judge: What is it, now, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Please! Please let me explain! Leads to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" I can prove it. Phoenix: Your Honor! Judge: Oh! The fire has returned to your eyes, I see. Phoenix: This picture... Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now. Judge: A contradiction!? Leads to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" von Karma: So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep. Why don't you point out exactly what is so strange in this picture for the court? Present bottom of cuff on left sleeve Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please direct your attention here!\" Present face Phoenix: Phoenix: Please direct your attention here! Judge: ...T-To her... face? Phoenix: With your own two eyes, you can clearly see that this face does not belong to Maya Fey! von Karma: von Karma: Fool! Do you even know what you're talking about anymore!? Phoenix: AAAH! THAT HURT! von Karma: Didn't we just finish discussing that her appearance changes during channeling!? Lotta: I know you ain't no dummy, so don't think yer foolin' no one here! Judge: There is a limit to everything, Mr. Wright. And that includes patience! Mia: Phoenix! You have to think before you speak! You can't just blurt out any old thing. Maya: ...Nick! You're supposed to be helping me! Phoenix: (*cringe* Even Maya's mad at me now... I have to focus!) Leads back to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: The contradiction lies... Here! Judge: ...You don't sound very sure of yourself, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Excuse me, but can you really tell me how much confidence I have in this!? von Karma: Hmph! What is with that attitude!? Phoenix: AAAH! THAT HURT! von Karma: Didn't we just finish discussing that her appearance changes during channeling!? Lotta: I know you ain't no dummy, so don't think yer foolin' no one here! Judge: There is a limit to everything, Mr. Wright. And that includes patience! Mia: Phoenix! You have to think before you speak! You can't just blurt out any old thing. Maya: ...Nick! You're supposed to be helping me! Phoenix: (*cringe* Even Maya's mad at me now... I have to focus!) Leads back to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" Phoenix: Please direct your attention here! Judge: ...T-To the sleeve? But... But there isn't anything odd about it... Phoenix: And that is exactly what is so odd. Something that should be there is suddenly missing. von Karma: \"Should be there\"...? Aaaaah! Phoenix: There was a bullet hole in the sleeve of the defendant's costume! If that's the case, then it should be in this picture as well! Judge: Ms. von Karma!! Y-You... You intended to hide this valuable piece of evidence!? von Karma: ... Judge: You will most certainly be assigned a penalty for this! Phoenix: (Alright. This should do some major damage to her argument...) Mia: Don't celebrate yet. Phoenix: You like to bring down the mood, don't you? Mia: Take a look at Ms. von Karma's face. Phoenix: (Argh! She's got that condescending grin plastered all over her face again.) von Karma: ...Tsk, tsk, jumping the gun again, I see. Your Honor! I would like to extend an apology on behalf of those incompetent fools. Judge: Wh-What do you mean? And what \"incompetent fools\"...? von Karma: If those fools down at the precinct hadn't missed the bullet hole, I would have gotten a report about it. As I didn't, I could not have known that this picture was of any value to this case. Judge: Hmm, I see... Phoenix: (She's lying through her teeth! I know it! That woman knew about everything! The bullet hole, the picture -- everything!) Mia: But you can't prove that. Franziska von Karma's idea of a \"perfect case\" is quite fascinating, don't you think? von Karma: Your Honor. You need not worry. If you must assign a penalty, I'll personally make sure that detective gets what's coming. I'm sure there will be a great gnashing of teeth at the next salary discussion. Phoenix: (Poor Gumshoe...) Judge: In any case, this is a very big problem! When the defendant was taken into custody, her costume had a bullet hole in its sleeve. However, from this photo, it would appear that right after the shooting, there was none! von Karma: ... Mia: The judge is confused by this strange twist of events. This is your chance, Phoenix! Load all you've got into this one shot, alright!? Phoenix: Got it! (Watch this, Maya!) Your Honor! There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction! This picture is a fake. Phoenix: The fact that the defendant's costume has a bullet hole in its sleeve is a fact! Which can only mean one thing. That this picture is a fake! Judge: Wh-What!? Lotta: Hey! You callin' me a forger now!? Phoenix: Well, no, not you exactly... Well, not per se... Lotta: Oh no ya don't! Don't you be scratchin' yer head with that goofy smile like some monkey! Now, why do ya think I'd do somethin' that nasty!? C'mon now! Mia: Phoenix! Use your brain for a change! Phoenix: S-Sorry, Chief... Leads back to: \"There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!\" The bullet hole was made later. Phoenix: There is only one explanation for why there is no hole in the sleeve in the picture! The hole was created much later, after the murder took place! Judge: A-After the murder!? Lotta: Hey! Those two gunshots we heard were before we broke in, or did ya forget!? Phoenix: Hmm... I-Is that how it went? von Karma: The pistol fired only two shots. No more, no less. Judge: You do know how to count, right? Mia: Phoenix! What are you doing!? Try it one more time! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Chief... Leads back to: \"There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!\" The shooter is someone else. Leads to: \"The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it.\" Phoenix: The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it. However, this person clearly does not. There can be only one explanation. The person who shot Dr. Grey was not the defendant, but a different person altogether! von Karma: Wha-Whaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! If order is not restored, I will suspend this trial! Oww! Phoenix: Aah! Lotta: Why me!? von Karma: The defense's... The defense's argument is a complete mess! Phoenix: A complete mess? I fail to see how! Please, enlighten us. von Karma: Hey, witness! Lotta: Aah! What the heck!? Is that any way to ask a gal a favor!? von Karma: Be quiet you! You were the one who said it was only the two of them when you entered the room! Lotta: Well, ya know... von Karma: If you were lying, I swear that my whip will be the last thing you see! Lotta: L-Look, sis... You're lookin' mighty scary so why don't we say you... Waah! I-I swear! I wasn't lyin' or nothin'! There wasn't anyone else in there! Honest! von Karma: You see! Now riddle me this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Where did the defendant vanish to!? And where did this other woman appear from!? Phoenix: Umm... (Why is it lately, all I want to do is cry...?) Judge: Well, if the person in this picture is not the defendant, then this poses 2 very big questions. First, where did the defendant vanish to, and second, where did this person come from? von Karma: That's right! Now hurry up and answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Mia: Come on! You can't fall apart here, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (I can't believe that even Mia's calling me by my full name... But... I mean... How am I supposed to prove something like this!?) von Karma: Had enough yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Or do you think you have enough in you to turn things around even now!? Phoenix: (To \"turn things around\"... That's right. Mia would always turn things around and change her perspective!) Mia: Phoenix...? Phoenix: (So, where did this intruder appear from, and where did Maya disappear to? I need to look at this situation from a different angle! Let's see... What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room... And what if Maya had left that room somehow... If I could prove that either one of those conditions were true...) Judge: Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you've come up with. Phoenix: I think what happened before we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber is... a 3rd person had entered it. Phoenix: Your Honor! I would like to present some evidence! I have proof that there was someone else in the room before the murder took place! Present anything Phoenix: Phoenix: Please take a good look at this! Judge: ...Okay... von Karma: I've already seen it. Phoenix: Thank you. Judge: And? What is the purpose of this item? Phoenix: Don't you see, Your Honor? von Karma: I don't think you actually see what you are doing. Phoenix: ... *sigh* Judge: I think it is the court that should be sighing at you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ouch, that stung...) Present another piece Leads back to: \"Your Honor! I would like to present some evidence!\" Think it over again Phoenix: (I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...) Leads back to: \"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\" Maya had left the room. Phoenix: Maya had left the Channeling Chamber at some point! And the defense can prove this! von Karma: Oh, how a foolish fool makes a foolish face while dreaming foolishly foolish dreams. Maya Fey was being looked after by her aunt, Morgan Fey. The chances of her leaving the crime scene is lower than that detective's salary! Judge: Anyway, let's see some evidence. Prove that from the murder until the time of arrest, the defendant had left the room. Present Black Key Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key?\" Present anything else Phoenix: The evidence you're looking for is... this? Judge: ... Lotta: Why the heck is there a \"?\" at the end there for!? Phoenix: Well, actually, I'm not really sure about this evidence, you know...? Judge: Next time, only present evidence you actually do have faith in. Phoenix: (Oww... That burned...) Present another piece Leads back to: \"Anyway, let's see some evidence.\" Think it over again Phoenix: (I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...) Leads back to: \"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\" something I can't explain yet. Phoenix: I'm sorry, but I simply can't. von Karma: Y-You see!? And the reason is quite simple. Because there is no explanation. That's why! Judge: Hmm... As I thought. Another big waste of this court's time. Mia: Phoenix! You can't just give up like that! Phoenix: But Mia! Mia: Rethink things one more time! There has to be an explanation! von Karma: I'm already \"perfect\". So of course, my conclusions are also \"perfect\". Phoenix: (Grr... Alright, Wright. Calm down and let's try this one more time!) Leads back to: \"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\" Phoenix: Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key? Lotta: Um... Well, I've seen it... Hey! That's the Channeling Chamber key, right? Before the channeling started, Maya locked the door from the inside with that... von Karma: The defendant herself locked the door...? Lotta: Yeah! That's why we all couldn't get the door open. That key's the only one of its kind, after all. Judge: Oh... One of a kind, you say? von Karma: ...! Wait... Mr. Phoenix Wright... Phoenix: Yes? (It looks like she's catching on...) von Karma: I'm afraid to ask, but... Why is that key currently in your possession? Judge: Huh? What do you mean? Phoenix: If Maya Fey locked herself in, then the key should have been with her. Judge: Yes, agreed. Phoenix: However, she did not have the key at the time of her arrest! Lotta: Aah! Well, ain't that a kick! So how come you're holdin' it!? Phoenix: I got this as a present from a certain little girl. And that little girl was nowhere near the crime scene at the time! von Karma: Th-Th-That's preposterous! Phoenix: This means that Maya Fey must have left the room! If she had not, then I would not be holding this key you see before you! von Karma: N-Nooooooo! Judge: It seems we have come to an impasse. This picture has clearly captured the face of the murderer. However, is this person the defendant or not? The defense is arguing that this person is not the defendant. Furthermore, as proof, this key has been submitted as evidence. Ms. von Karma. von Karma: How. Can. This. Be!? Judge: At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant's guilt is not possible. (Changed from [At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant is not possible.] in the original release) von Karma: My perfect case! How is there a flaw in my perfect case! Don't think you've won yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright! I am a prodigy! I have never lost a case! And I don't intend to lose here in this courtroom to a fool like you! I don't care what I have to do... I will get my guilty verdict! Judge: That's enough! If you would like to continue, do so in the lobby. Court will reconvene tomorrow at 10 AM. That is all. Court is adjourned. June 21, 1:32 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Maya: Woooow! That was you Pearly!? You summoned my sis!? Pearl: Yes. I felt I had no choice... Maya: Great going, Pearly! I knew you were special! Hey, Nick, did you know? Phoenix: (...Umm, yeah. It's not like anyone else in there could have done that.) Maya: Hmm, Nick... I know you're trying really hard and all, but... I really don't remember ever leaving that room. Pearl: And I don't think that a third person... could have gone into that room. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Well, at least we have until tomorrow to figure things out. Like, what happened in that room, for instance. Maya: Yeah. I'm counting on you! Pearl: Ah... I envy the two of you... Maya: Oh, by the way, Nick. Do you think you could take Pearly back home for me? Phoenix: Sure. Alright, Pearls. You ready to go buy some tickets? Pearl: Huh? A tik-ket? Phoenix: (Poor thing... So sheltered.) To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maya Fey... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned! Reunion, and Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 June 21, 3:24 PMKurain Village Pearl: Thank you very much for bringing me home, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: You're welcome. I had to come and look into a few things here today anyway. Pearl: Um... I thought about this a little. Phoenix: ? Pearl: If Mystic Maya didn't kill that nice man... Phoenix: She definitely didn't! Pearl: Yes, of course. But if she didn't... Then someone else did, right? Um, that \"murderer\" person! Phoenix: Yes, Pearls. Pearl: Oh... I see... Phoenix: (I wonder what's wrong... She seems sad...) Examine Phone booth Phoenix: It's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. I called the police from this phone. Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So, what did you think of seeing your first trial? Pearl: I was really surprised! I had never seen so many people before! Phoenix: O-Oh... Pearl: And Mystic Maya looked so small... and helpless. Phoenix: (Well, Maya's already naturally short, so...) Pearl: And then, that snobby woman with the ruffly clothes... Phoenix: (Ruffly... Oh, she means Franziska...) Pearl: She had such a bad attitude! She acted like she had already decided that Mystic Maya did it... I am going to tell her what I think of her tomorrow! Phoenix: (I wouldn't miss tomorrow's trial for the world...) Prosecutors (appears after \"Today's trial\") Pearl: Why was that woman bullying Mystic Maya? Phoenix: Well, she's the opposite of a lawyer -- a prosecutor, so her job is to prove people guilty. They don't care if someone's innocent. All they care about is if they win. Pearl: Th-That's terrible! B-But... She's really a good prosecutor with a heart on the inside, right? Phoenix: ... There's no one like that. All prosecutors are the same. ... Well, \"he\" might have become a good guy... Eventually... Pearl: \"He\"? Who are you talking about, Mr. Nick? Is it that person Mystic Maya was talking about? Mr. Eh-ji-werth...? Phoenix: ...That was a long time ago. He's not around anymore... Pearl: Huh? Phoenix: He clutched onto his foolish pride too fiercely... and died for it. Pearl: O-Oh... That's too bad... The murderer Phoenix: By the way... Pearl: Yes? What is it? Phoenix: Um, you wouldn't happen to know anything about who the murderer is... would you? Pearl: Wh-Why are you asking me!? Phoenix: No, I was just thinking earlier... Pearl: I didn't see anything! Phoenix: (She \"didn't see anything\", huh...? Speaking of that... During the murder... where was Pearls, and what was she doing...? And on top of that... This key... Just when did she pick this up...?) Pearl's alibi (appears after \"The murderer\") Phoenix: I just realized that I never asked you what you were doing at the time of the crime. Pearl: ...? Phoenix: Pearls, where were you and what were you doing when the murder happened? Pearl: Ah...! Phoenix: ...? Pearl: Wh-What I-I w-was doing? Ah, I-I w-wasn't d-doing a-anything! Phoenix: (She's really bad at lying...) You can whisper it to me. I won't tell anyone else. I promise. 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: Aah! Pearl: ... Um... I guess you can see through my lie, huh? Phoenix: Yeah... Clearly. Pearl: I can't lie to you, can I, Mr. Nick? Pearl's alibi (subsequent times) Phoenix: You really won't tell me what you were doing at the time of the murder...? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I'm sorry... Phoenix: But with the Magatama, I can unlock your Psyche-Locks, right? Pearl: Yes... Ah, what should I do...? Should I tell you what my secret is...? Phoenix: (If you would just tell me, it would be easier for the both of us...) Pearl: I'm so nervous... Phoenix: (Pearls is holding the key to this whole case! I can feel it! ...Speaking of keys, this one turned out to be quite important too... I didn't think it would literally be the \"key\" to today's trial.) Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: So... that's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure? Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: I feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama... Phoenix: (Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...) Folding Screen Pearl: So you like things about spirit channeling too? The Kurain Sacred Writings are on this folding screen. Phoenix: Oh? Is that what's written on it? Pearl: There are six lines to the Sacred Writings. Cleanse thy soul... Open the door to the spiritual realm beyond... Converse with the departed... ... Cast on thyself Protection... Maintain the spell... Release the spell... Phoenix: (So basically, this has nothing to do with the murder... Well, that's super.) Black Key Phoenix: About this key, Pearls... You found it on the day of the murder, right? Pearl: Yes. Phoenix: Now, where you found this key is very important. So, please tell me, Pearls. Where did you find this? Pearl: Um... I found it in the incinerator... Phoenix: The incinerator? (Hmm, is she talking about the one in the garden?) Pearl: The door on it was a little open, so I took a peek... Phoenix: When was that? Pearl: It was after the channeling, when everyone was in a panic. Phoenix: Hmm... Pearl: Um... Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ...? Yes? Pearl: Are you going to tell my mother? Phoenix: Huh? You mean, tell Morgan what you did? Pearl: Yes. If she finds out that I was playing in the left-over trash, I'll get a spanking. Phoenix: ...Ah, gotcha. Well, let's keep it a secret from her then, alright? (Hmm, the incinerator, huh? Sounds like a good place to search next...) Knife Pearl: I've seen this knife before. Phoenix: Really!? Where!? Pearl: M-My kitchen... Phoenix: (Oh... That's right... This knife belongs to the Feys...) Pearl: I'll skin and cut up some apples for you later, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: O-OK... Thanks. Maya's Costume Pearl: Th-That's Mystic Maya's! Phoenix: (Ack!! I shouldn't have shown her something this violent...) Pearl: I-I-Is that... Blood!? Phoenix: Umm... It's nothing. Really. Just forget your ever saw this, okay? (What was I thinking? I can't show stuff like this to a child.) Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Phoenix: (On second thought, showing her this picture might cause severe trauma...) Pearl: ...? Mia Fey profile Pearl: I knew her for a little while. Mystic Mia was your teacher, right? I'm sure she was a great Master of Lawyers. Phoenix: (\"Master of Lawyers\"... I guess...? I mean, it's not exactly a martial art...) Pearl: You should keep training, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're probably right. Pearl Fey profile Pearl: To tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me. Phoenix: I think your hair now suits you perfectly. Pearl: R-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget* Phoenix: *fidget, fidget* Franziska von Karma profile Pearl: Ah! This person! I can't let her get away with bullying Mystic Maya like that! I'm going to cast a curse on her! Phoenix: C-Can spirit mediums really do that...? Pearl: ... Actually, no, I guess not... Grr... I have to find something I can do, then! Phoenix: (When they're mad, the women of the Fey family could give Medusa a run for her money...) June 21Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: This case has had me out of the office most of the time... I can come back tomorrow. Helping Maya should be my top priority now. Examine Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's a handful but I've grown quite attached to the little fella. He also helps me to remember all the good times with Mia. June 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (Maya must still be in questioning... She'll probably be done in a little bit, so I'll come back later...) June 21Fey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: (It's really empty... There's supposed to be training held today, but I guess it's already over...) Examine Door Phoenix: A door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. But I guess it wasn't strong enough to withstand The Phoenix! June 21Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: (...Hmm, looks like Morgan's here too, but she hasn't noticed me yet... What is she doing...? She looks like she's talking to a picture...) Morgan: ...Don't you see? Take a look around... Finally, my chance has come... I've waited for this day for so long! That's right... Prepare yourself, dear Misty... Phoenix: (What in the...!?) Morgan: Who's there!? ...Oh, if it isn't Mr. Wright... Phoenix: Um... Just curious, but that picture you were just looking at... Morgan: Oh, today was that event, was it not, good sir? I heard you did well. Phoenix: Huh, oh, yes... Thank you. Morgan: I am terribly sorry I could not attend the trial today. Please accept my apology. I had a previous engagement, as I had to watch over the trainees' training today. Phoenix: (I get the sense she really doesn't want to talk about the picture...) Morgan: All because the Master can't be here with us, you understand. And that is why a lowly branch family member such as myself must do this. Examine Space behind folding screen Phoenix: There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. There wasn't anyone back here at the time of the murder... Or that's what Lotta testified in court... (I knew I should've taken a look... I can always count on Lotta to make things hard...) Talk What happened Phoenix: Have you remembered anything about the murder? (Changed from [Have you remembered something about the murder?] in the original release) Morgan: No, I told you everything I know already. Phoenix: Were you in this room the whole time when Lotta and I went to call the police? (Changed from [Where [sic] you in this room the whole time when Lotta and I went to call the police?] in the original release) Morgan: Yes, of course. I was by Mystic Maya's side the entire time. I performed the Spirit Severing Technique and held her in my arms afterward. Phoenix: Hmm, you said that yesterday as well. Did anything else happen? Morgan: I would like to say more did, however that is all that occurred. Phoenix: (Ah, I was really hoping for some new info...) Morgan: I suppose nothing happened in the end, good sir. Sorry to have played on your hopes. Phoenix: (Could you possibly be more patronizing...?) (Chnaged from [Why do I feel like I was just made fun of in the worse way possible...?] in the original release) Training Phoenix: So do the students train every day? Morgan: Yes, absolutely. They were given a day off the day after the murder, of course, however... Phoenix: And I assume both Maya and Pearls went through this training...? Morgan: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ack! Yes, yes! (Wow, she got real scary, real fast...) Morgan: How many times must I tell you before you understand, good sir? They are to be addressed as Mystic Maya and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: S-Sorry... I meant Mystic Maya and Mystic Pearl... Wait... I'm sorry, but \"Mystic\" Pearl? Isn't that going a bit too far...? Morgan: Next question, please. Phoenix: (Oh man... She's really being a pain in the butt about this...) Morgan: Please remember to watch not only what you say, but how you say it, good sir. The Master Phoenix: So the Master is... um, Maya's mother, right? Morgan: ...Mystic Misty... She is a brilliant medium. Phoenix: And where is she now...? Morgan: We are not sure. Phoenix: Not sure? Morgan: About 16 or 17 years ago, Mystic Misty failed at channeling a certain spirit. And after that... she simply disappeared. Phoenix: ... Morgan: I don't believe she will return to this village, in any case. And in four years' time, her name will be forever erased from this village. Phoenix: ...Erased? Morgan: A person who has been away from the village for over 20 years is considered dead... Phoenix: Oh, I see. Morgan: And that is four years from now for her. When that happens, a new Master will be appointed to Kurain Village. Phoenix: And...? Morgan: Mystic Maya was supposed to become the next Master... However with this... murder, I'm afraid... Phoenix: (I must be imagining things... I thought she was laughing to herself for a second there...) Present Folding Screen Morgan: There are six parts to the Kurain Sacred Writings. To think that this valued treasure of our village... and Mystic Maya were both shot by a gun... Phoenix: Well, that's... Morgan: Even if it was something that occured during a channeling, it is an unforgivable act. Black Key Morgan: This... This is the key to this room! Phoenix: That's right. Morgan: B-But why do you have it, good sir!? Phoenix: That, I'm not telling. Morgan: R-Return it at once! Phoenix: I... I can't. It's evidence, after all. (I think she knows exactly how important this key is to this murder... But what is this feeling I'm getting from her? It feels... Hmm... I can't describe it.) Maya's Costume Morgan: That is Mystic Maya's costume, isn't it...? It's a shame. I never thought anything like that would happen to her... Phoenix: But we don't know that it was Maya that did it... Morgan: Oh, poor Mystic Maya. Phoenix: (Do you ever listen to anyone other than yourself?) Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Morgan: That is Mystic Maya before I applied the Spirit Severing Technique... This picture... It was taken without my express permission. I knew allowing a person like her from the \"Heartland\" into our country was a bad idea. Phoenix: (You do realize that the \"Heartland\" is a part of this country, right...?) Turner Grey profile Phoenix: About this person... Morgan: Oh! It is that man, is it not? A man who wishes to borrow a departed spirit's power to hide the lack of his own. What an insignificant man. And see how pitifully he died. Phoenix: Insignificant...? Morgan: That would mean you are that man's insignificant little friend, dear sir. Phoenix: (Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?) Mia Fey profile Morgan: ...Oh, my... I think I may know of this person from somewhere... Phoenix: It's Mia. You know, Maya's older sister? Morgan: ...! Aah! Yes, that is who she is... Phoenix: (...How could you forget a daughter of the Master...!?) Morgan: If memory serves, she became a lawyer. Oh, how splendid for her, don't you think? Phoenix: (That soft, kind smile... It's the kind that tells you a pair of devil horns are not too far away...) Pearl Fey profile Morgan: Come to think of it, I don't believe I have seen my child today. Would you happen to know where she is, good sir? Phoenix: N-No, I wouldn't. Morgan: Honestly! Take one day off from training, and it is neigh impossible to make it up. Good sir! I pray you are not teaching her strange, fiendish things in her time off! Phoenix: (Oh boy. Here comes her anger. ...And we were having such a civil conversation too...) Morgan Fey profile Morgan: Being born as one of the Fey family, but of weak spiritual power... It makes the people of this village look down upon you, you know? Phoenix: I-I didn't know that... Morgan: But I will be alright. ...As long as I have Pearl. I am satisfied because I have my Pearl. Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this? Morgan: I am terribly sorry, but I am afraid my spiritual powers are not as strong as you might think... I really am terribly sorry. Phoenix: (Um, but this has nothing to do with your spiritual power...) June 21Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Looks like there's no one here... And even though the weather is gorgeous today, it's raining inside my heart...) Examine Side Room entrance Phoenix: That's the \"Side Room\". Looks like guests can use it as a place to take a break when they feel tired. Urn Phoenix: It's a really old urn. There are the ashes of a person long dead inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on. June 21Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: (The bedding is all laid out today too. Guess I'll leave them alone for now...) Examine Sliding door Phoenix: It's still charming to see a real sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard. Bed on right Phoenix: ...Excuse me... ... (Who am I talking to? There's no one here.) Yellow box Phoenix: Hmm, I keep wondering about this box. I'm sure this wasn't here before the murder took place. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom. After presenting Black Key in Kurain Village: June 21Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Hey, there's someone by the incinerator... Ooh, looks like they've noticed me. And are now running at top speed towards me...) Ini: Oh, hey! *huff, huff* Like, *huff, huff* You're that dentist guy. Phoenix: Actually, it's Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. Nice to see you again. Ini: Ooh, like, real suave. So, it's, like, my turn. It's nice to see you, too. Phoenix: So, what's up? You're all out of breath... Ini: L-Like, huh? Oh! Like you mean... Like, I'm just totally happy and like, totally excited to be here. Phoenix: Excited? Ini: Like, I mean, there are so many things to, like, see! It's, like, the real deal here! Phoenix: Oh, really? For example...? Ini: For example... Like, that urn over there. Do you, like, know about it? Phoenix: (All I see is an old, cracked piece of pottery...) Examine Incinerator Phoenix: That's right... Pearls said she found this key inside the incinerator. I guess I should take a look inside for myself... ... Th-This... This is from Maya's costume...! There's blood on it... A tiny bit, but still... Cloth Scrap added to the Court Record. Incinerator (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, this piece of cloth was burned in this incinerator. And this key was also found in there. Hmm, I get the feeling this incinerator plays a crucial part in this murder... Urn (after clearing \"Sacred Urn\" Talk option) Phoenix: So there's a spirit in this urn, huh? Hmm, all I see are a bunch of cracks. But I guess maybe the spirit could live in the space between the cracks... Hmm, looks like something's written on it... \"I AM\"? Huh? Weird... Sacred Urn added to the Court Record. Urn (subsequent times) Phoenix: So there's a spirit in this urn, huh? Hmm, all I see are a bunch of cracks. But I guess maybe the spirit could live in the space between the cracks... Hmm, looks like something's written on it... \"I AM\"? Huh? Weird... Talk Sacred urn Phoenix: Is there some sort of legend connected with that urn? Ini: Like, yeah! It's, like, this village's treasure! Phoenix: Huh. Didn't know that. Ini: And, like, it's sealed inside that urn. Phoenix: ...Um... \"It's\"...? What are you talking about? Ini: Like, you know! Ami Fey's spirit! Phoenix: Ami... Fey...? Who's that? Ini: Like, jeez, Mr. Smith. Get with the program! Everyone knows the lady that founded the Kurain Channeling Technique was Mystic Ami. Phoenix: Um, you don't have to get upset with me... Ini: So, like, as long as her spirit, like, lives in that urn, the spiritual power of the Fey family'll stick around. Like, isn't that totally romantic? Phoenix: Umm... Romantic, huh...? (If that urn is really as important as she says, it could be a vital clue...) What happened Phoenix: Ini, I want to ask you about the murder... Ini: Murder...? Phoenix: Dr. Grey's... Remember...? (As if there's another one?) Ini: Oh, that one! Like, you shoulda said so in the first place! So, like, I totally don't know anything 'cause I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room. Phoenix: Well, that's not much help... Did you notice anything at all? Ini: Like, come on. What a total bore. I, like, totally have nothing to do with this, like, murder thing... Phoenix: (Oh, yeah. You only introduced Dr. Grey to Kurain Village. No relation, sure. Even if you were only \"acquaintances\", that still means you knew him. Furthermore, your sister, who died in that accident, was a nurse at his clinic...) Ini: ... Traffic accident (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Alright then. Why don't you tell me about your sister's fatal accident. Ini: ... Like, why? You think, like, it's got something to, like, do with the murder? Phoenix: I don't know yet, but I'm trying to chase down every lead I can... (Changed from [I don't know yet, but I'm trying to chase down every lead I have...] in the original release) 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Psy... Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [...A... A Psyche-Lock!] in the original release) Ini: Like, what is it? Phoenix: (Looks like I'm going to need something to pry her mouth open on this one...) Traffic accident (subsequent times) Phoenix: Um, about the accident, Ini... 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Ini: Like, you're totally not gonna give up, are you? Phoenix: No, I'm not. Ini: I totally want to forget about my sister, you know? Time to move on and all that. Phoenix: (Guess I have no choice but to remove those locks...) Present Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Ini: Wow, so, like, the Kurain technique is the real deal. I'm gonna, like, have to write about it in, like, my report for school. Hey, so, like, you'll give me this picture for, like, the report, right? Phoenix: No way! Maya Fey profile Ini: She's, like, in a lot of trouble, huh? Phoenix: (She's stealing quick glances at the picture while smiling like a cheshire cat...) Ini: But, like, this will totally prove the power of channeling. Phoenix: (...\"This\"? What \"this\" is she talking about...?) Pearl Fey profile Ini: Like, that's totally Mystic Maya's cousin, right? Phoenix: Yes. Her name is Pearl. Ini: Hmm? So, like, this little kid is, like, the next Master...? Phoenix: Oh, no, no, no. Maya is the next in line to be Master. Ini: Ah, oh yeah. Like, that's right. After clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber, and presenting Black Key in Kurain Village, then examining incinerator in Fey Manor - Winding Way: June 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: Hey, Nick... I've been waiting... Phoenix: (...She looks so helpless...) Maya: So? So? How was it!? What did you find out!? Phoenix: Um... Well... I found a few things... Maya: Is it so bad that you can't even look me in the eye? (Changed from [My eyes are tearing up, Nick. Don't make me cry...] in the original release) Phoenix: I... I just need a little more time. It'll all come together by tomorrow, I promise. Maya: I'm sorry, Nick. Every time I see you, all I do is cause trouble... Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So how was it? Today's trial, I mean... Maya: You were fantastic, Nick! Every time I thought our goose was cooked, you managed to turn it all around. I bet it would make a great Hollywood movie! Phoenix: Don't be silly. We have to concentrate on the trial. We're going to win this, Maya! Maya: ...Thanks a lot. Really. Hey, Nick? The person who shot Dr. Grey wasn't me, was it? Phoenix: Of course not. You're completely innocent. Maya: If that were true, then I'd be really happy, but... there wasn't anyone else in that room with the two of us, right? Phoenix: Well, did you check behind the folding screen? Maya: Um... I took a quick glance, but there wasn't anyone there. Phoenix: Hmm... (That's exactly what Lotta said too...) Not guilty Maya: Um, Nick... Phoenix: Yeah? Maya: Why do you believe in me? Why do you think I didn't kill Dr. Grey? Phoenix: ...Because of something Mia told me. Maya: My sis? What did she tell you? Phoenix: She said that spirit mediums can't have dreams. When you're channeling, it's impossible for you to dream because your soul leaves you. Maya: Now that you mention it... Wait, then... then... I really am...? Phoenix: You are not the real murderer. I think that... maybe before you even called the spirit, you were drugged. Maya: Drugged...? Phoenix: I think this was planned from the very beginning. And you were set up to take the blame for killing Dr. Grey. Maya: That's... That's... Pearl's alibi (appears after clearing \"Pearl's alibi\" Talk option in Kurain Village) Phoenix: I want to ask you something about Pearls. Maya: Pearly? What about her? Phoenix: No matter what I try, she won't answer me. I want to know what she was doing at the time of the murder. Maya: Huh!? (Changed from [Hmm...] in the original release) W-Wait! Nick! Y-You don't think she did it, do you!? Phoenix: No, no, nothing like that... Maya: She'd never do anything like that! You hear me!? Never! She's a great kid, and really cute... And really great... And cute. Phoenix: I didn't really think she was the murderer. But... she's definitely hiding something. Maya: Hmm... Phoenix: You were with her on that day, right? Maya: Yeah. The two of us. We were playing with her ball. Phoenix: A ball, huh? (Sounds like a dead-end to me...) Ball (appears after \"Pearl's alibi\") Phoenix: So, about this ball... Maya: It's nothing really special... Just a plain old ball. I think she was still playing with it when I started the channeling job that day. Pearly really loves to play with that ball. Phoenix: She \"loves to play with that ball\", huh...? Maya: When she wants to get it, she always climbs right into the clothing box. Phoenix: The clothing box? Maya: Yeah. Pearly's always hiding in there. You know the Side Room? There's a clothing box in there. It's really big, so once you see it, I'm sure you'll know what I'm talking about. Phoenix: (The clothing box in the Side Room, huh?) Present Attorney's Badge Maya: It's the same as the last time I saw it. You just like to show it off, don't you, Nick? Are you that thrilled to be a lawyer? Phoenix: Th-That's not what I meant by it, but... I mean, I don't really think about it. I just sort of shove it in people's faces... Force of habit, I guess. Folding screen Maya: That hole... It looks an awful lot like a bullet hole... Phoenix: That's probably what it is. Maya: That's TERRIBLE! How could this happen to such an important screen!? Phoenix: ... Um, instead of dwelling on the hole, let's focus on the fact that you weren't shot... Maya: ... Hey, you're right! So I was the one who was about to get shot, huh? Th-That's TERRIBLE! Who'd want to shoot little ol' me!? Phoenix: (I guess she didn't realize she was the one being shot at until now...) Black Key Maya: Ah! That's... The Channeling Chamber's... Phoenix: This is the only one in the world, right? Maya: Yeah. During the trial, I was kinda wondering why you had it... Phoenix: I got it from Pearls. Maya: That's weird... I swear I locked the door... and then put the key into one of my pouchy sleeves... Phoenix: Your sleeve? But how and when would your sleeve leave the room? It didn't grow a pair of legs... Maya: I wonder where Pearly found that key... Knife Maya: That's a knife from my family's kitchen. I'll never be able to use it again... Phoenix: It's alright. I'll buy you a new one, OK? Maya: Argh! That's not the point! ...I don't ever want to see another knife... ever again... Maya's Costume Maya: That... That's... That's mine, isn't it? Phoenix: (Dammit! I upset her again...) Maya: It really was me, wasn't it? Wasn't it, Nick? Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Maya: This... This is me, right? I guess I really did shoot Dr. Grey... Phoenix: But that's not you! Maya: Is too! Phoenix: Is not! Maya: Is too, is too! Phoenix: (I should've kept this picture to myself...) Sacred Urn Maya: That's Kurain's Sacred Urn. Mystic Ami's soul is sealed inside of it. Phoenix: Yeah, I know all about it. About how she's the founder of the Kurain Technique. Maya: Ooh, look at Mr. Smarty here! Thinks he knows all! You sound like an occult fanatic. Phoenix: (...Trust me, this isn't going on my resume any time soon...) Maya: You know, I haven't looked at this in a long time. I wonder when it became so cracked? Cloth Scrap Maya: ...What is it? Phoenix: I'm not too sure myself, but I found it just now inside the furnace. Maya: Huh? Is it trash burning day already? Phoenix: That's not something I would know about... (I guess she didn't notice the bloodstain. Probably better that way...) Mia Fey profile Maya: What am I supposed to do, sis!? ... Pearl Fey profile Maya: Pearly... She definitely has more than me... Phoenix: Huh? What are you talking about? Maya: Who I think the next Master should be... I mean, she's got more spiritual power than me, and she really works hard at her training... Phoenix: (Way to go Phoenix... Way to bring the mood down even further... *sigh*) Franziska von Karma profile Maya: So she's Prosecutor von Karma's daughter, huh? Phoenix: Looks like it. Maya: Well, then... she'd know about that person, right? Phoenix: (\"That person\"...? Is she talking about \"him\"?) It's alright. We don't need to talk about that right now... Maya: ... Ami Fey profile Maya: ...Mystic Ami. She's a Legendary Spirit Medium. I like the way that word sounds... \"Legendary\"... Ever since I was young, I've dreamed of being a \"Legend\". Phoenix: (Well, this murder will make you into a \"legend\", alright... Hmm... I probably shouldn't say that last thought out loud...) Any other evidence Maya: Um, I can't think of anything special about it... After clearing \"Ball\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: June 21Kurain Village Phoenix: Ah! Lotta: AAAAAAAAH! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait! Please! Lotta! ... (She ran off into the manor...) June 21Fey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: Lotta... Lotta: Aaack! Phoenix: H-Hey! I'm tellin' ya, quit followin' me, ya hear!? I'm a worthless piece of trash! Ya lay eyes on me, and they'll turn ta dust! Phoenix: (...*sigh*...) Channeling Chamber Phoenix: Hey! Morgan! Morgan: Yes, what is it? ...And must you be so noisy!? We have a rule here: \"The hallway is not for running\" Now then, in a calm manner ask your question. Phoenix: Okay... Anyway, did you see Lotta come by here? Morgan: Ah, that girl from the \"Heartland\"... I'm sorry, but she did not pass by here at any time. Phoenix: (Grr... Lotta! You sure know how to waste a man's time...) June 21Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: I'm pretty sure I saw Lotta run in this direction... but it doesn't look like she's here... Examine Ball Phoenix: It's Pearl's ball. Maya said that it's always kept in the clothing box... So then, what is it doing on the floor...? Pearl's Ball taken. Clothing box Phoenix: It's the clothing box where Pearl's ball is usually kept. I wonder what's inside... Aaaaah! Phoenix: Whaaaa!? Wh-Wh-What were you doing in there!? What were you thinking!? Lotta: I'm a bad person! Just another piece of human trash. I needed a hole to crawl into... Phoenix: ... (So you crawled into this clothing box because there wasn't a hole to crawl into? Oh man... ...Huh?) There's a small hole in this clothing box... And it's about... 8 inches off the ground! That's the same height as the hole in the folding screen! Then, could this...? Clothing Box added to the Court Record. Clothing box (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's the clothing box where Pearls keeps her ball. I thought I felt my soul shake when Lotta jumped out at me. So it's big enough to fit a grown adult... Well, if she can be called an adult... June 21Fey ManorMeditation Room Pearl: Oh, Mr. Nick! That person ran by here just now. Phoenix: What person? Pearl: Um, you know... The person with the fluffy cotton candy hair... Phoenix: (Ah, she means Lotta.) Pearl: She said, \"Don't look at me with 'em eyes!\" but... I'm not that scary, am I...? Phoenix: ...I don't think that's quite what she meant. Pearl: Oh, that's right. She also wanted me to tell you, \"Goin' on a trip to find myself, so don't ya bother findin' me!\" Phoenix: O-Oh... Well, thanks. Pearl: You're welcome. Talk Pearl's alibi (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: Around when Mystic Maya started the channeling on that day, I was playing in the Winding Way... with my ball. Phoenix: And that's when you... broke the urn? Pearl: Y-Yes... I broke it... I... I accidentally let Mystic Ami's spirit fly away! Phoenix: Don't worry. Morgan will never know, OK? Pearl: I'm a bad child... Breaking a village treasure is unforgivable. I thought... that maybe they would make me leave the village. But the broken pieces were pretty big, so... Phoenix: You thought you could put them back together, and no one would notice? Pearl: ...Yes. Sacred Urn (appears after \"Pearl's alibi\") Pearl: I found some glue and brought it to the hallway... and fixed the urn there. Phoenix: The hallway? You mean \"Winding Way\"? Pearl: Yes. The channeling had already started, so I didn't think anyone would walk by. Phoenix: Hmm, I see... So, about how long did it take you? It must have been a nasty repair job. Pearl: Yes. I might be strong at spiritual things, but when it comes to arts and crafts, I am not nearly as skilled. When I had finished fixing the urn and looked up, I saw you coming into the manor... Phoenix: (So that's around when Lotta and I were coming back inside after reporting the murder.) Pearl: When I saw that, I packed everything up in a hurry. Um... Mr. Nick? Phoenix: What is it, Pearls? Pearl: I'm... I'm going to get banished, aren't I? Phoenix: I really don't think that's going to happen. I mean, I bet Mystic Ami's happy to be free from that cramped urn. Pearl: Y-Yeah, I hope so... Phoenix: (No harm done, and a happy resolution... Phew!) Sacred Urn updated in the Court Record. Sacred Urn (appears after \"Pearl's alibi\") Pearl: I found some glue and brought it to the hallway... and fixed the urn there. Phoenix: The hallway? You mean \"Winding Way\"? Pearl: Yes.

I mean, I bet Mystic Ami's happy to be free from that cramped urn. Pearl: Y-Yeah, I hope so... Phoenix: (No harm done, and a happy resolution... Phew!) Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Pearl's Alibi -- Phoenix: Pearl. You have to tell me what you were doing when the murder happened, OK? Pearl: Um... But what if I can't just tell you what happened...? Phoenix: Then I'll guess what happened. How does that sound? Pearl: What!? Y-You can do that? (Changed from [Eh!? Y-You can do that?] in the original release) Phoenix: You'll tell me if I guess something right, won't you? Pearl: ...Y-Yes... Phoenix: Now, when the murder was taking place, you were here, right? Present Winding Way Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were here, weren't you Pearls -- in the Winding Way?\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: I'm pretty smart, Pearls. I know you were right here. Pearl: No, I wasn't... Phoenix: Huh? I'm wrong? Pearl: Ooh, I feel a little better. Phoenix: (Ooh, I feel a little warmer... from embarrassment. ...I'd better try again...) Leads back to: \"Now, when the murder was taking place, you were here, right?\" Phoenix: You were here, weren't you Pearls -- in the Winding Way? Pearl: W-Wow! ...Y-You got it. Phoenix: So? Do you think you can tell me now? Pearl: ...I'm sorry... Not yet... Phoenix: Man, oh man... Alright, what next...? OK, I think I know what you were doing there. Pearl: D-Do you really know that much? Phoenix: Well, I am a lawyer, you know. Now, what was it Pearls was doing in the Winding Way? Present Pearl's Ball Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were... playing with this ball, right?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... Phoenix: So? Pearl: I feel just a little better. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: You are a lawyer, but you're also still a person, after all... Phoenix: Sorry, I'll get it right this time... Leads back to: \"OK, I think I know what you were doing there.\" Phoenix: You were... playing with this ball, right? Pearl: Ah! That's right! How... How did you know...? 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Maya told me that you love to play with your ball. Pearl: Um... Yeah. I was playing with my ball. Phoenix: Un, huh. And then? Pearl: ... Phoenix: Something happened, huh? ...Something really bad... Pearl: *gulp!* Wh-What do you mean, \"something\"!? N-N-Nothing happened...! Phoenix: This is it. While you were playing with your ball, this happened! Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Leads to: \"This urn... It's a village treasure, right?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... Phoenix: Were you so surprised that you were shocked into silence? Pearl: ...Yes, at how wrong you are, even though you were so sure of yourself... Phoenix: ...Huh? (Way to embarrass yourself in front of an 8 year old, Wright...) Ah, sorry, sorry. Just see if you were paying attention... Ah heh heh. Pearl: It's okay Mr. Nick. You can always try again. Leads back to: \"This is it.\" Phoenix: This urn... It's a village treasure, right? Pearl: Ah... Um... Phoenix: And the spirit of the founder of the Kurain technique is sealed in here, isn't it? Pearl: ...Y-Yes... Phoenix: What's this? It's cracked all over, isn't it? There's even a few gaps here and there... Pearl: Um... Please don't tease me... Phoenix: Pearl, you broke the Sacred Urn, didn't you? Pearl: ...! Phoenix: The ball smacked into it and knocked it over, right? And if Morgan found out, she'd get really mad, huh? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (She doesn't seem to be fighting back... I think I hit the bull's-eye this time. But it's strange that the lock hasn't broken yet...) Pearl: I-It's... It's a really old urn, isn't it? Phoenix: I-I guess? (Changed from [Eh?] in the original release) Pearl: I-I-It's so old... So it's not that weird... to have a few cracks... Phoenix: (Her voice is shaking...) Pearl: H-How can you tell that urn has been broken!? Present Ami Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Who started the Kurain Channeling Technique?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ...I'm sorry. I don't want to be mean, but... Phoenix: (*sigh* I figured...) Pearl: Um, do you want to try again? Phoenix: Yeah. (I'm sure I can get it if I think about it some more! The thing I'm missing... must have something to do with what's written on the urn...) Leads back to: \"H-How can you tell that urn has been broken!?\" Phoenix: Who started the Kurain Channeling Technique? Pearl: Huh? (Changed from [Eh?] in the original release) Oh, um, it was Mystic Ami... (Changed from [Um, it was Mystic Ami...] in the original release) Phoenix: That's right. And how do you spell her name? Do you know? Pearl: How do I spell her name? Um... I don't know... Phoenix: It's spelled \"A-M-I\". Pearl: *gasp!* Phoenix: I thought it was a little odd when I saw \"I AM\" written on this urn. Pearl: ... Phoenix: And that's how I knew that someone must have broken this urn. And made a mistake in spelling when they put it back together again... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful After examining the \"Clothing box\"  in Fey Manor - Side Room and adding it to the Court Record: June 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: M-Mia! Mia: Phoenix, it's good to see you. I was really worried so I thought I'd see how you were doing. Phoenix: ...You might get caught on film again... Mia: There are certain risks you have to take in life, or in my case, death. Anyway, how are you doing? Have you found anything useful? Phoenix: Um, only a little. I think I'm slowly beginning to understand everything, piece by piece. Mia: Everything will resolve itself by tomorrow, somehow. Talk Tomorrow's trial Mia: There's still a whole slew of questions for you to answer before the trial tomorrow. Phoenix: You mean like how did the real murderer get into the room and kill Dr. Grey...? Mia: Yes. Also, when did the murderer enter the Channeling Chamber...? You guys were all standing around in front of the room after the channeling started. Phoenix: Which means that the murderer must have gone into that room before the channeling... Mia: That's what I think, in any case. Phoenix: But Maya's already said there wasn't anyone else in there. Mia: ...That's true... But if we can't figure out the murderer's movements, we're stuck like a beached whale. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Kurain Channeling Technique Mia: I thought I'd never see this day. Are you actually asking me about spirit channeling? Phoenix: This case is all about spirit channeling. And I feel like I don't understand a thing about it... Mia: Well, that's only natural... After all, spirit channeling isn't exactly an everyday thing, is it? Phoenix: Yeah, I guess you're right. Mia: The power to change your physical appearance into the person you're calling was something our ancestor, Mystic Ami Fey acquired. Phoenix: I've heard that name before... Mia: The Fey family was originally a family known for its service to the gods. When Mystic Ami was born, she was given a certain fate through her name. Because, you see, she was named after one of the Buddhas of Buddhism, \"Amitábha\". To this day, her soul is still sealed in the Kurain Sacred Urn. It usually sits in the Winding Way, and has her name written on it. Phoenix: Um, yeah... Mia: Aww, come on, Phoenix. It's just a fairy-tale. Phoenix: (Are you saying that me being able to see you is just a fairy-tale too...?) Present Anything Mia: Come on, Phoenix. We don't have time to be looking at things like this. We need to find out everything we can for the trial tomorrow. After clearing all Talk options: Mia: Well, it's about time I left. Phoenix: M-Mia! Mia: We'll be in big trouble if the guard sees me here... Phoenix... Phoenix: Yes, Chief! Mia: There is still a lot of dirt left in this case. Once you think you've gathered all the evidence, then come back. Phoenix: ...Yes, Chief. After clearing \"Sacred Urn\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Meditation Room: June 21Kurain Village Phoenix: (Phew. I think I've found everything I can. But I can't see how it all adds up... Hmm... (Changed from [But I can't see how they all add up... Hmm...] in the original release)) ...H... He... Phoenix: (And is Ini Miney being here just a coincidence...?) ...Hey, Mister... Phoenix: (How is it that the spirit Dr. Grey wanted to call just happened to be that nurse, and that nurse turns out to be Ini's sister... It's too... convenient...) ...Hey! Phoenix! I'm talkin' to you! Phoenix: (I wish I knew a little more about Ini, but where am I going to find info like that?) Oh, I get it. Ya can't be bothered to look over at trash like me. Is that it, Mr. High-and-Mighty!? Phoenix: Aah! L-Lotta! Lotta: Oh, so ya finally noticed! Phoenix: (I thought I heard a mosquito buzzing in my ear, although I couldn't understand a word...) Lotta: Well, I gotta hand it to ya. Ya sure know how to chase down garbage! I mean, I'm grateful to ya for chasin' this large lump of one around like this. Phoenix: Um... Thanks...? Lotta: But ya know, you're just wastin' yer time. I'll be fine on my own. Phoenix: Wh-What are you going on about? And as for \"following\" or \"chasing\" or whatever it is, isn't that what YOU'RE doing!? Lotta: Um, well, ya see... Well, yer not exactly a real gentleman with a lady's heart, are ya? Phoenix: (You're not exactly the world's number one charmer either, sister.) Talk Today's trial Lotta: Look, I'm really dang sorry about today! When I get all fired up about somethin', it's impossible to stop me. Phoenix: You hurt Maya really badly, Lotta. Lotta: Um... I don't suppose you could forgive a gal like me...? Forgive her Phoenix: Well, I guess. You did help Maya out too, after all. Lotta: For real? Phoenix: Yeah, for real. Lotta: Ah, thank goodness... I'm still... Phoenix: \"I'm still...\" what...? Lotta: N-No, no, nothing, nothing at all. Just talkin' to myself, ya know, gibberish... ...Now then! Lotta Hart, at your service! Phoenix: ? Lotta: I'll share with ya all the dirt I've dug up! Phoenix: Th-Thanks. Lotta: Hey, don't be all surprised! Tell ya what, I'll even give ya all this info for free! Phoenix: (Lotta not taking money? Now I KNOW this one's an alien clone...) Leads back to Talk options Don't forgive her Phoenix: I'm not done... Lotta: Um... Phoenix: And to think we trusted you, Lotta, and what do you do!? You stab us in the back! You stressed us all out and even gave Maya a few strands of white hair! Lotta: Urngh... Phoenix: Now I'm going to have to pray she makes it, or she may come back as a ghost... Lotta: Ack! That's enough! Ya can stop right there! Look, I'll tell ya everything I know! Everything! I'll spill it all! Phoenix: Everything? Lotta: Yeah, ya got it! Everything! But... Well, actually... Tell ya what, I'll even do it for free! Phoenix: (You were expecting me to pay you after what you did to us!?) Leads back to Talk options The murderer Phoenix: If Maya is not the real murderer, then... who do you think is, Lotta? Lotta: Well heck, ain't it obvious? It's that occult freak! Phoenix: You mean Ini Miney? Lotta: Well, there ain't anyone else it could be, right? That granny, you and me, we were all together that whole time... Phoenix: (So, Lotta suspects Ini... Which means she might have already found some info about our mysterious Ini...) Ini Miney (appears after \"Today's trial\" and presenting Ini Miney profile) Phoenix: Speaking of Ini, do you have any other information about her? Lotta: Sure. Phoenix: Well, what is it!? Lotta: Ha ha ha... It'll cost ya... And it'll cost a lot! Phoenix: (Oh, silly me. Here I thought \"free\" meant \"no money necessary\".) Lotta: That girl was hospitalized about half a year ago. Phoenix: Hospitalized...? But why? Lotta: Well, heck, you can go find out on yer own. Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: Here, I'll give ya the clinic's address. Maybe ya can find out something. Phoenix: \"Maybe\"...? What's that supposed to mean!? Lotta: Well... See, actually, it was gonna be annoying, I reckoned, so I didn't actually go there. Phoenix: Aargh... Lotta: Well, that's the way the gumbo spoils, right? Phoenix: Spoiled gumbo sounds... Eww... I mean, look, don't blame this on... Oh, never mind! (Looks like I don't have much of a choice. Better go check out this \"Hotti Clinic\"...) Present Newspaper Clipping 1 or Newspaper Clipping 2 Phoenix: About this clipping... Lotta: Now, you listen here, boy, and listen good. You can't go lookin' at such an old piece of paper, ya hear!? People's got eyes on the front side. You know why? So they can see in front of themselves! Not behind! So how about it? You feelin' my energy? Phoenix: (Nope, not an electron.) Pistol Lotta: Ya think I could have the guts to carry one of these around? A celebrity photographer with a gun? Ya think it'd work? \"Bang, bang!!\" ...Nah... Thanks, but nah. I can't see myself like that. Knife or Maya's Costume Lotta: Aaaaah! Th-There's... There's blood on it!! Get that away from me! Where do you get off showin' somethin' like this to me!? Phoenix: (Oops, guess that was the wrong thing to show her...) Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Lotta: I'm a real natural, aren't I? I caught the murder just right, and even managed to make it mysterious. Phoenix: Mysterious!? All you managed to do was forget to focus your lens! Lotta: Shaddup! That's my technique! My technique, now, ya hear!? Turner Grey profile Lotta: Hey, it's that Dr. Grey guy. It's a pity what happened to him. Pretty scary what ghouls and ghosts can do to a man, huh? Gawd rest his poor soul. Phoenix: (Hmm... Since when was Lotta so religious...?) Maya Fey profile Lotta: Now, this kid -- I think she needs to be taught some manners. This here's her second time in the stew, right? My Pa woulda slapped me straight! Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Lotta: Ya know what they say, if there's a second time, there's bound to be a third, and a fo- OW! Nngh... Ya didn't have to slap me. I get it, I get it. Sorry... Pearl Fey profile Lotta: Hmm... I overlooked this little kid. Phoenix: Wh-What do you mean? Lotta: I mean, I didn't think it, but ya know how it's always 'em silent types? Phoenix: H-Huh!? Wait, wait, wait... Lotta: The little tyke's nothin' but a ball of happy goodness, right? So I reckon, she's the type to have done it! Well, now, that's just how the world turns. Phoenix: I don't think this has anything to do with how the world turns... Morgan Fey profile Lotta: That old lady sure can be forceful. She scared me that day. ...Well, only a little, now, ya hear? Ini Miney profile Lotta: Heh, that's Ini Miney, right? Phoenix: Yeah. I was wondering if you know anything about this girl... Lotta: Ya know! Actually, I did a little checkin' up on her the other day. Her sister, she's the one that Dr. Grey wanted to call back from the spirit world. Phoenix: Yeah, I had heard as much... I had also heard that Ini was the one to introduce Dr. Grey to Kurain Village. Lotta: Ya don't say? That's one sneaky gal, if you ask me... Hey, ya want me to tell ya more about her? Lotta Hart profile Lotta: Ya know, I'm beginnin' to get sick of this hairstyle. Next time I go to the salon, I'm gonna get my hair straightened, I reckon. What do ya think, Phoenix? Phoenix: I think if you got rid of your afro, I wouldn't recognize who you were. Lotta: Yeah, that's kinda the problem, ain't it? Phoenix: (Please, can we get on with the important stuff...? Say, like the murderer...) Franziska von Karma profile Lotta: Hey, this is that prosecutor gal. The one that likes breakin' all the rules. Switches are for horses and lights, not people! How's that? I made a pretty clever pun, didn't I? Phoenix: ...Sorry, didn't hear you. Lotta: Ah, well, I'll forgive the wax in yer ears this once and tell it to ya one more time. After clearing \"Ini Miney\" Talk option in Kurain Village: June 21Hotti ClinicReception Phoenix: (...So, this is where Ini was hospitalized...) ???: Hmm, yes... Are you here to visit a patient? Hmm... Phoenix: Ah, yes... Are you a doctor here...? ???: Hmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. Phoenix: (Ack! I didn't think I'd be speaking with the Director himself...) Hotti: Hmm, yes...? So what can I help you with? Uh, huh... Phoenix: I'd like to ask you a few questions about Ms. Ini Miney. Hotti: Hmm? Ms. Miney? Ms. Ini Miney? ...Hmm... Yes... Hmm... OH! Her! Ah, it's too bad. I'll tell you something. That girl left here a long time ago. Nurse: Here you are! Sir! Phoenix: ? Nurse: You know you shouldn't be up and about! Come on, it's back to your room with you! Hotti: Ah, Sweet'ums! Calm down, calm down. Don't be so harsh to an old man like me. Nurse: Don't you dare start that \"Sweet'ums\" thing with me! If you don't behave, you'll get yourself tossed out of this hospital! Phoenix: (Wow. I didn't think nurses could be this direct or forceful towards their boss.) Nurse: Come now. Be a good boy and give me the Director's white lab coat! Hotti: OK, OK. I got it. I. Got. It. Hmm, yes... Phoenix: ... Hotti: ... Phoenix: Um... Hotti: Hmm, yes? Uh, huh? Phoenix: Don't \"Hmm, yes\" me. Who in the world are you? Hotti: I'm Director Hotti. Hoh, hoh. Phoenix: ... Phoenix: (The nurse went off somewhere... Oh the inhumanity. Only person I can talk to... ...is this guy... ...Uuuugh...) Examine Waiting room on left Phoenix: This must be the waiting area. It's got the feeling of one and there are sofas lined up... but I don't see all that many patients. Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, it's the quality, not quantity that counts. Uh huh... Phoenix: (What in the world did that have to do with anything...?) Door at end of hallway Phoenix: (I wonder where that door way down there leads to...?) Hotti: Oh, that's the X-ray room. Hmm, yes... Phoenix: H-H-How did you know what I was thinking!? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, it's... Because that's the X-ray room... Uh huh, yes... Phoenix: (There is something very peculiar about this guy... Because I know it's not me...) Patient with crutches Phoenix: This patient is undergoing rehabilitation. Hotti: And look at that strained face twisting in all those ways... and that oily sweat... hmm... His whole body is swaying back and forth, wobble-wobble, like he's about to fall. Hmm, yes. Phoenix: Hey! Don't just cut into my monologue like that! I'm explaining things here! Hotti: Ah, sorry. Hmm, yes... Most sorry... Yes... Uh, huh... Reception area Phoenix: This is the clinic's reception desk, but it doesn't look like there's anyone at the counter. On the wall is this month's \"Word to the Wise: Do something in vain, and your only reward is tiredness.\" Hmm, not exactly the best thing to be telling your patients, is it? Talk Hotti Clinic Phoenix: So, what exactly do you treat at this clinic...? Hotti: Hmm, yes... We treat all sorts of... doctory, clinical stuff, uh, huh, yes... Phoenix: D-Doctory, clinical stuff? Hotti: Well, I don't actually know or particularly care about the details. Hoh, hoh. Phoenix: ... Hotti: Hmm, hmm... Yes... What is that look for? A-Ah, yes. There's a really big general hospital around the corner. Hmm, yes... When they can't accommodate everyone, they move some of their patients here. Uh, huh. Phoenix: You do surgeries here, right? Hotti: Hmm, yes... We do some plastic surgery here, it seems... Hmm... Phoenix: It... seems? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Uh, huh... It seems that way. Ini Miney Phoenix: What do you know about Ms. Ini Miney? Hotti: Now you're talking! Hmm, yes. That girl, she was transferred from the general hospital. Phoenix: From the general hospital...? To here? What kind of surgery did she need? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, she needed surgery. It was really bad. Really bad. Phoenix: So what kind was it...? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well... No, no... You see, that is something... No, I can't tell you. Phoenix: (So you say with a happy smile on your face... \"Mr. Director\"...) Hotti: See, there's this thing about how doctors aren't allowed to talk about patient stuff. It's in all those TV shows too, right? You've seen them, right? Hmm, yes? Phoenix: (I'm never going to get him to unzip those broken zipper teeth of his at this rate... There's got to be something I can show to this old coot...) Ini Miney (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about Ini Miney. Hotti: Hmm, yes... I'll get to that, trust me, I will. That girl... That's right. She was transferred here from the general hospital. This was... hmm, yes... a year ago. She was one of those... \"emergency\" cases. Phoenix: What was she ill with? Hotti: Ill? Nah, nah, nah. She was injured, not ill. With my trained eye, I could see. Yep, I could see it was a huge wound at that. Phoenix: A huge injury? Hotti: Her whole body was wrapped around and 'round in bandages and her arm was in a cast. Phoenix: That sounds... pretty severe, alright... Hotti: Hmm, yes... It was an accident; an accident. They're scary, yes? Cars, hmm, yes... Phoenix: Car...? ...You mean it was a traffic accident? Hotti: Yep! That's what gave her the terrible injuries. I swore it was in the papers, hmm... Yes, I looked it all up, I did. It was terrible... Hmm, yes... Phoenix: (...Dare I even ask what is wrong with this old guy...?) The operation (appears after \"Ini Miney\") Phoenix: Just now... You mentioned something about a big operation? Hotti: Hmm? Are you talking about Miss Ini's operation? Phoenix: Y-Yes... Miss Ini's. Hotti: That... Ah, that was one heck of an accident. Hmm, yes... Her whole face was burned like bad toast. It was bad. Very bad. Phoenix: Was it really that bad...? Hotti: Hmm, it was a good thing that Miss Ini had a picture of herself. I heard that picture was how they put her face back together... Hmm... Phoenix: Picture...? Hotti: That girl, see, she had, uh... She had just gotten her license. So she just happened to have a license photo on her, hmm, yes... Phoenix: Oh. Hotti: So, see, I got her picture. As a way to remember her, yes... Well, more like... Swiped... Phoenix: (Um, breech [sic] of ethics...? ...Oh, wait...) Hotti: What? What? A pretty girl like her -- I bet she has lots of pictures of herself... Phoenix: Um... Sure... Hotti: It's a treasure. My treasure... Preciiiious... Phoenix: What happened to the actual license itself? Hotti: Who knows. I didn't bother to ask. It probably got burned up along with the car. Hmm, yes. License Photo added to the Court Record. The operation (subsequent times) Phoenix: Just now... You mentioned something about a big operation? Hotti: Hmm? Are you talking about Miss Ini's operation? Phoenix: Y-Yes... Miss Ini's. Hotti: That... Ah, that was one heck of an accident. Hmm, yes... Her whole face was burned like bad toast. It was bad. Very bad. Phoenix: Was it really that bad...?

Phoenix: What happened to the actual license itself? Hotti: Who knows. I didn't bother to ask. It probably got burned up along with the car. Hmm, yes. The accident (appears after \"Ini Miney\") Phoenix: Um... So you \"looked up\" information on Ini's accident, correct? Hotti: Yep, yep. Sure did... Hmm, yes... I read every paper that covered it at the time. Phoenix: What kind of accident was it, do you remember? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Hold on. I'll go get it for you. The article, I mean. Phoenix: H-Huh? Y-You have it? Hotti: Well, well, well, don't get me wrong. I thought something like this might come up, so. Phoenix: (Obsessive to the max... But I bet I could learn about how to stay on a lead from this guy.) Ah, here we go, here we go... Hmm, yes... Hotti: According to this, Miss Ini was in the passenger's seat. Phoenix: The passenger's seat, huh? Hotti: And dozing... Or so it says. A strong jolt woke her up, and the next minute, a sea of fire was all around her. Miss Ini fought with the door, finally got it to open, and somehow managed to get away. ...Anywhoo, you can read all the details in the article. Hmm, yes... Newspaper Clipping 2 updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: (A new clue! I should probably look this over.) The accident (subsequent times) Phoenix: Um... So you \"looked up\" information on Ini's accident, correct? Hotti: Yep, yep. Sure did... Hmm, yes... I read every paper that covered it at the time. Phoenix: What kind of accident was it, do you remember? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Hold on. I'll go get it for you. The article, I mean. Phoenix: H-Huh? Y-You have it?

I should probably look this over.) Present Attorney's Badge Hotti: Hmm? What's this? Phoenix: I'm a lawyer. Right now, I'm investigating a murder. Hotti: Hmm, hmm, yes... What is with your angry face? Violence isn't the answer, hmm, yes... Phoenix: The trial is tomorrow. And I would really like some information from you. Hotti: Hmm... Is that right...? ...Well, you know, I think I can let you in on a little secret... Phoenix: What's that? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Actually, ... I'm not the real Director. Phoenix: Are you kidding!? Anyone with half a fly's brain knew that! Hotti: Eh!? Wh-What do you mean!? Phoenix: (Do I have to explain this to him...?) Hotti: Well, hmm... Hold on. I'll give you something. Real information, OK? Phoenix: ? Hotti: I'm actually, this clinic's... See, I'm like this place's... \"walking dictionpedia\"...? Phoenix: You mean \"walking encyclopedia\"? Hotti: Y-Yeah, that. And my specialty is in young, silky-smooth hottie patients... There's nothing I don't know about them... But I get \"embarrassed\" talking about it. Phoenix: ...Yeah... How about you keep that kind of information to yourself...? Hotti: Hoh, hoh, hoh. Anyway, you wanted to know about Little Miss Ini Miney, right? (Changed from [Hoh, hoh, hoh. Anyway, you wanted to know about Miss Ini Miney, right?] in the original release) Phoenix: (\"Little Miss\" Ini Miney?) (Changed from [\"Miss\" Ini Miney?] in the original release) Hotti: That girl... Ah, I remember her especially well... Really, especially, very well... Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Hotti: Now this is what I'm talking about! Hmm, yes... nice. This is nice and exciting. Phoenix: What do you think? Does anything grab your attention? Hotti: There's no mistaking this is nice... Hmm, yes... I like... Yes... I like this picture... Hmm, yes... Mind if I borrow this for a while...? For... \"private research\" purposes... Phoenix: Umm, that's okay... (I don't think I should support his \"research\"...) License Photo or Ini Miney profile Hotti: Mmm... Miss Ini is really cute in this picture. You'd agree, right? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, sure. Hotti: I wish I could see her again. Maybe the next time she has a big accident. Hmm, yes... Phoenix: ...I'll tell her for you... Hotti: Hmm, yes... Please... Hmm... I'll be waiting for her... Hmm... Yes... Waiting... Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So about this girl... Hotti: Hmm... She is... Um... Not the best... Hmm, yes... But she'd be a great candidate for surgery... Hmm, yes, yes... Hmm... That's really the only thing I can prescribe for her... Phoenix: (...What is he talking about? What surgery...?) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Would you please take a look at this person...? Hotti: Oooh... This is, this is... ...A superb example of a woman... I'd like to... hmm, meet her... just one time... Bring her to me tomorrow. Hmm... She'll get special attention from me, I promise. Phoenix: (Wh-Where does he think he is!? This is a medical facility!!) Pearl Fey profile Phoenix: So, about this girl... Hotti: Isn't she the patient down in room 206...? Hmm, yes... I'm sure that cute nurse is taking very good care of her. That nurse said the girl has chicken pox... or was it measles... Maybe the flu...? Phoenix: (Um, Pearls is fine and well, although I feel sorry for the nurse now.) Mimi Miney profile Phoenix: About this person... Hotti: Hmm... Hmm... I feel like... I feel like... Somewhere... I've seen her somewhere before, I think... Hmm... Hmm... Well, when she comes tomorrow for her consultation, I'm sure we can get re-acquainted... Phoenix: (...I don't believe this...) Franziska von Karma profile Phoenix: This person... Hotti: Ooh, she's nice. That look in her eye... She looks like a queen. She's glaring at me. Hmm... Ah, her stare is making me choke up in tears. Phoenix: ...I... I was whipped by her... And it hurt... a lot... Hotti: Oh, wow! I am so JEALOUS! So? Did you cry? How did it feel? Phoenix: (...I cried a little... I think...? I can't actually remember...) Director Hotti (purported) profile Hotti: Oh, it's me. Hmm, yes... My tuft of hair... It's so nice. Shows off my smartness... You should try it too. My new hairstyle that I invented... Phoenix: ...Ah, that's OK. I'll pass on this one... Any other evidence Phoenix: Um, so what do you know about this...? Hotti: I see this and, um, my mind's blank. Hmm, yes. It's boring, that's why. Boring. Hmm, yes... How do I put it? If you had more... Hmm... More attractive items... Yes... Phoenix: (...Attractive...? Huh?) Any other profile Phoenix: So, I'd like to ask you about this person... Hotti: Hmm... Something tells me... Hmm, yes... Umm... No, nothing. There is no need to bring this person in for an exam. Wouldn't do it anyway. Hmm... Phoenix: (Even as a pretend doctor, he gets an F from me...) After clearing \"The operation\" and \"The accident\" Talk options: Hotti: It's been half a year since Miss Ini had her surgery and got better. She was discharged sometime in December last year. Phoenix: (It's already been half a year, huh...?) Hotti: Hmm, yes... So, how was I? I was a real help, wasn't I? Hmm, yes... Phoenix: Y-Yes... Thank you very much. Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, then, I'll be getting back to my room then. Tell Miss Ini I said hi, OK? Hmm, yes... Phoenix: (It's time for me to leave too, hmm, yes... Ack! OK, it's definitely time to leave!) June 21Kurain Village Lotta: Hey! So how was it!? Didja go to the clinic? Phoenix: Yeah... I found out a few things... I guess... Lotta: ...What's the matter? Ya ain't lookin' so well. Ah, yeah. So earlier, that ol' granny called the cops. Phoenix: ...Huh? The cops? Why would Morgan call the police? Lotta: She said she had \"somethin' to tell 'em\". Things are sure gettin' interestin'. Talk Morgan Lotta: Ah, but honestly, I tell ya, that granny sure got her bloomers in a knot. Phoenix: Well, I guess you could put it that way... Lotta: It always starts out small, ya know? Stealin' the Master's seat, and controllin' the village folk... and now ya see what it's turned into? A murder, that's what. Phoenix: Yeah, what a mess. ... H-Hey, hold on! Lotta: What? Phoenix: That stuff you were just talking about... That's the first I've heard of it. Lotta: Heh, really? Well, it's old news to everyone else in the world. Phoenix: (Well, excuse me for not keeping up with gossip while I'm busy saving people!) Phoenix: You said something about \"stealing the Master's seat\"? Lotta: Yup. Right now, the Master is this medium named Misty Fey, but... the one that was really supposed to be the Master was that old granny. Phoenix: (Morgan was supposed to become... the Master...?) Ini Miney Phoenix: Do you know where Ini is, Lotta? Lotta: Yeah, I saw her not too long ago. She's hangin' around that garden in the middle. Phoenix: OK, thanks. Lotta: Ya got somethin' to ask her? Phoenix: (Yeah. I've got a whole list of things only she can clear up for me...) The Master (appears after \"Morgan\") Lotta: So I hear the Master has always been the oldest daughter. Phoenix: The oldest daughter...? Lotta: Turns out, that old bat is Misty Fey's older sister... Phoenix: O-Oh? Lotta: They say the older sister is usually the one with more spiritual power. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Maya said the same thing a long time ago... She warned me not to take Mia's powers lightly...) Lotta: Well, anyway... somehow, granny there lost to her younger sister, Misty. Phoenix: I see... Lotta: This made the townsfolk turn against her, so I hear. Said all sorta things too, like, \"She's the oldest, and yet she doesn't have the power to be the next Master. Disgraceful.\" Phoenix: (Wow. I had no idea...) ...So what would've happened had Morgan been stronger...? Lotta: Maya's family woulda been the branch family, I reckon. June 21Fey ManorWinding Way Ini: Hey! Like, I haven't seen you in a while... Phoenix: Yeah. (I think I have enough to finally unlock her secret...) Ini: ...Like, what's with that scary look on your face...? Talk Traffic accident (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Ini: Yeah... I was... riding... Riding in that car... with my sister. We were... like, on our way home... I was riding in the passenger seat when I fell asleep... ...And then, it happened. At the time, I grabbed for my purse, and escaped from the passenger-side door. Phoenix: ...And your sister...? Ini: I, like, couldn't do anything... The car was full of smoke... I couldn't see anything... Phoenix: Oh, I'm sorry... Dr. Grey (appears after \"Traffic accident\") Phoenix: Did Dr. Grey really cause that accident by drugging your sister with sleeping pills? Ini: Like, he was totally out to get my sister... He totally did that to, like, pay my sister back... Phoenix: (Hmm, I wonder... This does give Ini a good reason to want to murder Dr. Grey!) Ini: Ha ha ha. It seems simple, doesn't it? Phoenix: What do you mean!? Ini: But, it would be very hard to catch me. Actually, I'd say impossible. Phoenix: What!? Ini: I think you get the picture. I'm going to serve you a slice of humble pie! I hope you enjoy it. Ha ha ha... Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Traffic Accident -- Phoenix: Please tell me about the traffic accident. Ini: Huh? Like, whose accident? Phoenix: Your sister's accident, naturally! Ini: Oh... Um, oh, yeah... So, like, that Dr. Grey guy made my sister fall asleep... And, like, that's all I have to say about that. Phoenix: Hmm... (Interesting... Ini just asked, \"Whose accident?\"... Which means... She must know something about another person's accident...) Alright, let's change the topic, then. How about you tell me about a certain other person's accident? Ini: Huh? Another person's accident...? Like, you got someone in mind?

It doesn't matter what you say, I know you were in a car accident! Leads back to: \"So, wow, like, how strange.

I have to say, this photo looks like you. Ini: ...That creepy fake Director! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Now are you ready to tell me about the accident...? Ini: Like, wait a sec. OK, so, like, I was in an accident. Sure. But that's, like, totally not related to this murder! Phoenix: Actually, it is. Look at this article. It says that \"one of the women died\", correct?

Phoenix: (Hmm... If memory serves... Mia had a few Psyche-Locks of her own...) Mia. I'm ready to unlock the last piece of information I need now. (Changed from [Mia.

While the murder was being committed, my aunt was outside with everyone else. Which means she already has an alibi. Phoenix: That's true... Mia: Show me some evidence that would cast suspicion onto my aunt. Present Black Key Phoenix: Phoenix: My evidence is this black key. Mia: ... Phoenix: At the beginning of the channeling, Maya had possession of this key. And yet, somehow, it magically ended up in the incinerator in the center garden. Mia: ...You're right. Phoenix: There is only one person who could have done that while I was busy calling the police. The person taking care of Maya -- Morgan. Mia: ... Phoenix: What's that look mean? Mia: Your argument is too flimsy. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: When did the key find its way into the incinerator? It could have happened long after the murder happened. Phoenix: Long after...? Mia: Someone could have found the key somewhere and dumped it into the incinerator. Phoenix: But that's... Mia: That prosecutor would use something this small to shred your case. Do you have something other than just the key to cast suspicion on Morgan? Present Cloth Scrap Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is the other piece of evidence that points to Morgan as the culprit.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Mia: Phoenix, we don't have any time left. Phoenix: (I haven't even said anything yet...) Mia: You can't pin my aunt as the murderer with one piece of evidence alone. Leads back to: \"Do you have something other than just the key to cast suspicion on Morgan?\" Phoenix: This is the other piece of evidence that points to Morgan as the culprit. Mia: ... Phoenix: I also found this in the garden incinerator. It's the same material as Maya's costume... Except for the splotch of blood. Mia: But this piece may not even be from Maya's costume. Phoenix: But this is what Maya told me. \"While I was channeling, the key was sitting inside my sleeve.\" And both this key and the piece of cloth were found inside the incinerator. Phoenix: Which means that this piece of cloth was a part of Maya's costume. Mia: But when Maya was arrested, she was wearing her costume. Phoenix: That just means someone changed her clothes. Mia: Changed her clothes? But why...? Phoenix: I don't know why. But... There is only one person who could've done that. Mia: The one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt. 1 LOCK BROKEN Leads to: \"You did very well, Phoenix.\" Present Cloth Scrap Phoenix: Phoenix: The proof is this piece of cloth. Mia: ... Phoenix: I found it in the incinerator near the Winding Way. It's the same material as Maya's costume... Except for the splotch of blood. Mia: You mean, it's from Maya's costume that she was wearing at the time of the murder? Phoenix: Yes. Mia: But when Maya was arrested, she was wearing her costume. Phoenix: That just means someone changed her clothes. Mia: Changed her clothes? But why...? Phoenix: I don't know why. But... There is only one person who could've done that. Mia: The one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt. ... Phoenix: What's that look mean? Mia: Your argument is too flimsy. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: You have no proof that this piece of cloth is actually from Maya's costume. Phoenix: But... this blood... Mia: And do you know whose blood that is at this point in time? You don't, do you? Do you have any proof that piece of cloth is from Maya's costume? Present Black Key Phoenix: Leads to: \"I think this is the proof you're looking for.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Mia: Phoenix, we don't have any time left. Phoenix: (I haven't even said anything yet...) Mia: You can't pin my aunt as the murderer with one piece of evidence alone. Leads back to: \"Do you have any proof that piece of cloth is from Maya's costume?\" Phoenix: I think this is the proof you're looking for. Mia: ...The key to the Channeling Chamber, huh? Phoenix: At the beginning of the channeling, Maya had possession of this key. And yet, somehow, it magically ended up in the incinerator in the center garden. Mia: ...You're right. Phoenix: And this is what Maya told me. \"While I was channeling, the key was sitting inside my sleeve.\" And both this key and the piece of cloth were found inside the incinerator. Phoenix: Which means that this piece of cloth was a part of Maya's costume. Mia: It would certainly seem that way... Phoenix: Someone changed her into a different set of clothes. And then, burned the costume she was wearing in the incinerator. There is only one person who could've done that. Mia: The one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt. Phoenix: Exactly! 1 LOCK BROKEN Leads to: \"You did very well, Phoenix.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Um, I think this...? Mia: No. You're wrong. Try again. Phoenix: You're really unforgiving today, Mia... Mia: And I keep telling you... Don't take this lightly. Maya's life is on the line. Phoenix: (Mia is really serious...) Mia: Now, I'm going to ask you one more time. Leads back to: \"While the murder was being committed, my aunt was outside with everyone else.\" Mia: You did very well, Phoenix. Phoenix: Thank you. Mia: As long as you have those two pieces of evidence, you can cast suspicion on my aunt. However. Phoenix: H-However? Mia: Like I said in the beginning, my aunt has an alibi. Phoenix: Yeah... She was with us the whole time... Mia: Here's my final question. You don't have to present solid proof of this for me. But I want to know. If my aunt is the culprit, then how did she commit the murder? Phoenix: How she did it, huh...? Mia: I want to hear your thoughts. In order for my aunt to murder Dr. Grey, who or what did she need...? Present Ini Miney profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Ini Miney. She's the answer to the final question.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: ... (No idea... Just throwing things out now...) Mia: ...And you were so close too, Phoenix. Phoenix: Yeah... Mia: There is no way my aunt could have done it herself. So, thinking logically, where does that leave you? Should be easy for you to figure out... Phoenix: (So, if Morgan couldn't have done it herself... Then...) Mia: Come on, Phoenix. Think. Leads back to: \"In order for my aunt to murder Dr. Grey, who or what did she need...?\" Phoenix: ...Ini Miney. She's the answer to the final question. Mia: Which means that my aunt and Ini Miney... Phoenix: ...Were in cahoots! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Mia: ...Something's been bothering me all this time. This crime is something no normal person could carry out. The person would have to know a lot about Fey Manor and the village itself to do this. Phoenix: ...But Morgan already has an alibi... Mia: Yes, which is why I can't figure out how it was done. We can assume that Ini Miney is involved somehow... Phoenix: But we have one big problem on our hands. Mia: ...A problem? With what? Phoenix: We don't have a motive. Why would Morgan want to kill Dr. Grey? Why would she have to? Also, we don't really know for sure that she was cooperating with Ini. Mia: ... Phoenix: (Mia doesn't have a clue either, huh?) Mia: Hmm... Then, there is only one possibility... Phoenix: Huh!? Mia: Think about it, Phoenix. Why would my aunt do something like this? And why would she do it in such an underhanded fashion? Phoenix: Um... because...? Mia: Mother... She is the one who holds the key to this. Phoenix: Mother? Whose? Mine? Mia: Don't be silly. Mine, of course! Misty Fey. Phoenix: (Mia and Maya's mother? Why would she bring her up now...?) Mia: Now then... Looks like we've gathered everything we could. All we have to do is win tomorrow! Everything will become apparent then. Phoenix: R-Right, Chief! We won't lose! To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- After the Murder --Ini: Like, when the channeling started, I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was that because of your, um... sesame allergy, was it? Ini: Like, that's right. I, like, think there were sesame seeds, like, in the lunch they served that day. I had this, like, premonition that it was going to totally be a \"seedy\" day. von Karma: Yes, indeed. Judge: Hmm... I see... Phoenix: (...Am I the only one who missed the boat here...?) Judge: Anyway, so you were taking a nap. Did something happen while you were sleeping?Ini: Like, a little later, someone came into the room, like, really suddenly.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you know the time? Ini: Um, uh... Like, maybe a little before 11 AM? Something like that, I think... Phoenix: E-Eleven AM...? Ini: Yeah. Like, my stomach is totally ready for, like, food. Phoenix: ... Ah, no... I think you misunderstood me... I'm not asking what time it is now... I meant what time was it when the \"someone\" came into your room! Ini: Oh! So, like, that's what you meant! Like, you shoulda been more, like, clear about it! Phoenix: S-Sorry. My bad. Ini: No, it's OK. Like, it's really... Phoenix: ... Ini: ...? Phoenix: ...That's it? Why'd you stop mid-sentence!? Ini: Did I? ...So, like... what was I talking about again...? Phoenix: ... N-Never mind... von Karma: ...Witness. About this person who entered the Side Room...Ini: It was, like, oh my gawd, totally my sister!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely sure? Ini: ...I guess? Phoenix: You \"guess\"...? Was it or was it not your sister who entered? Ini: Like, I don't know. I mean, like, I totally don't know \"your sister\" at all, Mr. Smith. Phoenix: (First off, my name is not Mr. Smith. Second, I'm an only child. ...Hmm, but more than that, she's managed to mess up the question with her answer...) Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Th-The defense rests... von Karma: Well, that was a colossal waste of our time! Now then, witness. How did you feel when you saw Ms. Mimi Miney?Ini: I, like, hadn't seen her in, like, so long... I was so happy in, like, a sad way...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You were... happy in a sad way...? Ini: Yeah, like, I mean, it was my sister! Phoenix: But wouldn't most people react here with surprise at seeing a dead loved one alive again? Ini: Um, but, like, maybe if I was, like, someone who didn't know about, like, the occult. But I, like, know all about the Kurain Channeling Technique. von Karma: The point here, is the witness immediately recognized that it was her \"sister\". Ini: Yeah, like, what she said. Phoenix: (Hmm... Should I drop this  line of questioning...?) Question further Phoenix: So you really didn't think anything \"strange\" of the whole encounter? Ini: No. Like, there wasn't any reason for me to, like, think anything was \"strange\". Phoenix: But... OWW! von Karma: Don't keep badgering her. Phoenix: ...You know the phrase, \"Objection!\"? Could you try using that once in a while...? Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright. This question of what the witness felt when she saw her sister... is it really that important? Oh, it's nothing. Phoenix: \"Is it really that important?\" Let me ask you: Is it really that important for you to ask? Judge: Of course it's very important. Phoenix: Well, I don't think it's that important at all! Yeow! von Karma: Stop spewing such nonsensical things then. Pay no attention to this twit and continue, witness. Ini: Like, OK. Leads back to cross-examination It is very important. Phoenix: It is very important! (Although I haven't quite figured out what \"it\" is yet. But I've got to bluff for now and make it seem like I know what I'm talking about...) Judge: Alright, Mr. Wright. Ms. Miney, please amend your testimony. Ini: Like, OK. I'm, like, totally cool with that. Changes statement from \"I, like, hadn't seen her in, like, so long... I was so happy in, like, a sad way...\" to \"I wasn't, like, scared at all. And, like, her costume looked totally, like, normal.\" Leave her be Phoenix: (There's no need to press her over something this minor... I should be trying to find a more decisive problem with her testimony...) Ini: So, like, is it OK? I'm going to, like, finish my story, OK? Leads back to cross-examinationIni: I wasn't, like, scared at all. And, like, her costume looked totally, like, normal.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, there was nothing odd at all about your sister's appearance? Ini: Like, yeah. Nothing was, like, weird. Phoenix: (...Hmm...) Mia: ... Phoenix: (Hm? ...Mia's talking to herself like she's found something wrong...) Mia: ...That's impossible... Phoenix: (...?) Ini: Like, is everything OK? Can I, like, go on...?Present Maya's Costume or Lotta's Photo 2 Phoenix: Leads to: \"That was a very well-spun lie, Ms. Ini.\"Ini: My sister... She, like, told me something, like, totally terrible.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Something \"terrible\"? What was this thing she told you? Ini: Huh? Like, didn't I just, like, tell you about it? Did you, like, forget already? von Karma: A foolish fool with a foolish sieve for a brain only speaks foolishly with foolish words. Phoenix: (Well, excuuuse me, Princess. ...Anyway, should I ask to hear the story again...?) Don't bother asking Phoenix: (I did just hear this story. It's not like my memory is that bad...) Actually, the defense is fine and does not need to hear the story again. Judge: Very well. You may continue your testimony, Ms. Miney. Leads back to cross-examination Ask to hear it again Phoenix: I'm sorry, but could I hear the story one more time? Ini: Like, sure, no problem. I'll even, like, tell it all spooky-like for you. That was... no accident... I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini? Ini: ...Like, how was that? Judge: It was a little scary... Ini: Like, I'm sorry. Maybe I, like, put too much spookiness into it...? Leads back to cross-examinationPhoenix: (I know there has to be something here I can use... But where!?)Mia: She really put a lot of thought into this lie, didn't she? We can't rush this. Let's take it slowly, one step at a time. She's bound to slip up somewhere. Don't give up. But don't get careless, OK? Remember, calm and collected.Phoenix: That was a very well-spun lie, Ms. Ini.Ini: ...!von Karma: Wh-What are you babbling about this time, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?Phoenix: It's well constructed... but that's all it is.Mia: Stealing MY lines now, are we, Phoenix?Phoenix: Ms. Miney, may I remind you of what you said? You said that there was nothing strange about your sister's appearance.Ini: L-Like, yeah... And...?Phoenix: But I don't think that's what you were thinking at all. Take a look at this picture. (Changed from [But I don't really think you thought that at all. Take a look at this picture.] in the original release) This is a picture of the \"sister\" you met. I would think that even you would be surprised if someone like this appeared before you.von Karma: ... The blood spray...Phoenix: Ms. Miney!

Ini: Like, I guess so... I guess maybe, like, taking her revenge on Dr. Grey, like, made her feel a lot better... von Karma: I'd like to feel a lot better too... Mr. Phoenix Wright. The sooner the better... Phoenix: (She says with her whip at the ready...) Ini: And, like, Ms. Morgan was the only one in the Channeling Chamber, you know? Phoenix: May I ask you one more thing, Ms. Miney? Ini: Like, sure. Phoenix: Was there anything you found strange, unusual, or just out of place? Ini: Something out of place? Huh? Like, when do you mean? Phoenix: Uh, when...? Um... When you... were in the Side Room. Phoenix: I'm talking about when you were in the Side Room, of course! Ini: Um... Like, no, nothing strange. Phoenix: (Hmm... What should I do...?) Press harder Phoenix: Think harder! I know you can remember something! Ini: I, like, totally can't! von Karma: Just give up already, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (I wonder if I put too much faith in Ini's ability to do anything with that brain...) Leads back to cross-examination Leave her be Phoenix: (Even if I push her, this is probably a dead end... I should search for something stronger to hook her with.) Judge: ...Hmm... Well, if the defense is finished, please continue with your testimony. Ini: Like, OK. Leads back to cross-examination were going to the crime scene. Phoenix: I'm talking about when you were going to the Channeling Chamber, of course! Ini: Um... Like, no, nothing strange. Phoenix: (She answered rather quickly... Now what...?) Press harder Phoenix: Think harder! I know you can remember something! Ini: I, like, totally can't! Phoenix: That's not good enough! You have to explain yourself clearly to this court! Judge: Hmm... Do you think, Mr. Wright, that whether or not there was something odd on the way to the Channeling Chamber is all that important? It's very important. Phoenix: I ask because it is VERY important! (...Not that I know where I'm going with this...) Judge: Very well. Ms. Miney, if you will, please include a statement about this in your testimony. Ini: Like, I don't get why, but, OK. Adds statement \"I, like, didn't see anyone on the way to, like, the Channeling Chamber.\" It's not that important. Phoenix: ...Actually, I really have no idea! Judge: Then don't say it like you know what you're talking about! von Karma: This has been the most extravagant waste of time that I've ever seen. Judge: Let's continue on with the testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Leave her be Phoenix: (Even if I push her, this is probably a dead end... I should search for something stronger to hook her with.) Judge: ...Hmm... Well, if the defense is finished, please continue with your testimony. Ini: Like, OK. Leads back to cross-examination arrived at the crime scene.

I remember, like, I totally didn't see anyone on the way. Phoenix: (Hmm... I guess this really is a dead end...) Mia: Something you finally pull out of a witness is never a dead end, Phoenix.Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Phoenix: I've finally found the fault, or I guess in your case, the \"crack\" in your perfect lie. Ini: ... Phoenix: Take a look at this urn. Ini: Like, urn...? Phoenix: There are cracks. Do you see them? Ini: S-So? Like, what does that prove? von Karma: von Karma: Who cares about some worn-out old urn!? Ini: Like, yeah. I already, like, said I didn't see, like, anyone on the way to the Channeling Chamber. I didn't, like, totally say anything about, like, an urn, did I? Phoenix: It looks like you still don't understand. I propose that if you had really been walking along the Winding Way at that time, there was no way you could not have seen this person! Present Pearl Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'd like to introduce someone to you.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Oops, silly me. Slip of the finger. Judge: M-Mr. Wright. You need to keep control of that finger of yours. Phoenix: ...As I thought, this is the wrong piece of evidence. Oww! von Karma: An irresponsible lawyer has no place in this court! I suggest you go home! Phoenix: (Oww... So it's come down to a blunt \"go home\"...) Mia: Don't over-think this. All you need to do is remember what happened yesterday. Leads back to: \"I propose that if you had really been walking along the Winding Way at that time,\" Phoenix: I'd like to introduce someone to you. This is Ms. Morgan Fey's daughter, Pearl Fey. Judge: Y-Yes...? And how is this child relevant...? Phoenix: It just so happens that at the time of the murder, Pearl was playing in the center garden. Judge: Oh... Phoenix: And she just happened to break this urn. Judge: Oh... OHHH! von Karma: W-Wait! She... broke the urn...? Phoenix: Yup. She accidentally knocked it over with her ball! Ini: Nnaaawrr! Leads to: \"And Pearl was the one who put it back together...\"Present Pearl Fey profile Phoenix: Phoenix: You say that you didn't see anyone on the way to the Channeling Chamber... However, that is impossible! Ini: ...Like, what you do mean?... Phoenix: I'd like to introduce someone to you. This is Ms. Morgan Fey's daughter, Pearl Fey. von Karma: Interesting, you have a semi-intelligent look on your face. So? What about this child? Phoenix: It just so happens that at the time of the murder, Pearl was playing in the center garden. von Karma: The garden...? Phoenix: Yup! Which means anyone walking through the area would have to have seen her! So, Ms. Miney, what do you have to say to that!? Ini: Nnaaawrr! von Karma: von Karma: As the court can see... she's a bit of an airhead. Also, she was leading her \"sister\" at that time. Do you honestly think she would have noticed a simple child playing!? Preposteous! Phoenix: Phoenix: It's not preposterous, and I can prove it! von Karma: Wh-What sort of foolish... Phoenix: There is no way someone walking along the Winding Way could not have noticed Pearl! Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Leads to: \"This urn is my proof.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Oops, silly me. Slip of the finger. Judge: M-Mr. Wright. You need to keep control of that finger of yours. Phoenix: ...As I thought, this is the wrong piece of evidence. Oww! von Karma: An irresponsible lawyer has no place in this court!

Leads back to: \"There is no way someone walking along the Winding Way could not have noticed Pearl!\" Phoenix: This urn is my proof. von Karma: An old, cracked clay pot? What is that going to prove? Phoenix: Do you know why it's cracked? It's because Pearl broke it! That's why! Judge: She broke the urn...? Yeow! von Karma: Why... Why do I feel like you're about to ruin my beautiful day...? Phoenix: This urn was broken around the time the channeling started! Ini: Ah! Leads to: \"And Pearl was the one who put it back together...\"Phoenix: (No good. I can't find anything wrong...)Mia: Phoenix, the Judge believes this testimony. If you don't find some sort of hitch in her statement...Phoenix: He'll end the trial...

    "cot": "Evidence 4 (Folding Screen) shows a bullet hole about 8 inches off the ground. Testimony 4 by Ini states, \"I, like, didn't see anyone on the way to, like, the Channeling Chamber.\" However, given that Pearl was playing in the garden and broke the Sacred Urn at the time, anyone walking along the Winding Way to the Channeling Chamber (as Ini claims to have been) would have seen Pearl. Thus, Ini's testimony that she did not see anyone going to the Channeling Chamber contradicts the implication of evidence 4 and other testimonies about Pearl's presence. This contradiction is used in the investigation to show that Ini’s testimony is suspicious or false given the established timeline and positioning of Pearl.\n",

I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini? Maya: I finally get to see you again, and... Phoenix: It's not your fault. You didn't do it. Maya: No, I... I did it... I killed that person. Phoenix: But that wasn't you. Maya: It doesn't matter. It might as well have been me. Phoenix: (I can't believe something like this happened...The events of that gloomy, rainy afternoon that started this whole mess...keep playing through my mind...) Episode 2Reunion, and Turnabout June 16, 3:34 PMWright & Co. Law Offices ???: What depressing rain... Do you understand how depressed that makes me!? Do you!? Phoenix: Uh, I guess... ???: But actually, more than being depressed, I'm angry. Angry at that weather girl on TV. \"I think our little rainy spell will take a break with a day of sun!\"...is what that girl said! I'd stake my life on it! Phoenix: Well, it's the weather... ???: But that's why I didn't bother to bring an umbrella today. What nerve, calling herself a weather girl! She's going to hear about my $1500 suit! Phoenix: Um... About your case... Unless you're planning on suing the weather girl...? ???: ... I'm sorry. I thought that before we got down to business, we could have some friendly chatter. My name is Dr. Turner Grey. I'm a surgeon. Phoenix: (Remind me never to end up under his knife...) Grey: I'm here today because of this incident. Phoenix: \"Malpractice at Grey Surgical Clinic. Fourteen In-Patients Lose Their Lives!\" ...Oh. You're... the doctor at...? Grey: It's really quite upsetting. Did you hear me!? UPSETTING! Phoenix: Yes, yes, I heard you. I agree, it's quite upsetting, Dr. Grey. Grey: The one that screwed up was that nurse! It was her that got the medications mixed up and killed those 14 patients! And yet! Now listen good! And yet! That nurse had the nerve to go and die before admitting to her wrongdoing! She didn't even offer any sort of explanation to me! And this is the kicker! She up and has herself a grand ol' accident and crashed her car! Smash! Crunch! Instantly transforming her car into the accordion model! Phoenix: (That's right... About a year ago, all the tabloid shows were talking about it. Fourteen victims of medical malpractice and the nurse's mysterious fatal accident. There were rumors that Dr. Grey had actually caused that crash. People said it was to forever hide the person responsible for the malpractice incident.) Grey: Why would I...? Now, I'm just going to say this once -- Why on Earth would I want to kill that nurse? She's the one who killed those 14 patients! Not me! Phoenix: I think you need to take a deep breath, doctor, and focus... More to the point, this case is over a year old. Why bring it up now...? Grey: That's simple! Because the situation is slipping out of my grasp. This just won't do. My clinic isn't seeing nearly as many patients nowadays. Do you understand what that means!? It means they're not coming to my clinic! Phoenix: (You don't say...? If it were me, I don't think I'd want to go either.) So... what would you like me to do about it...? Grey: I want you to help me prove I'm innocent. Phoenix: Um, you do realize I'm a lawyer, not a private investigator, right? Grey: No, this is something only you can do. Phoenix: ...? Grey: Maya Fey. You know this girl, correct? Phoenix: ...! (Maya! Why would he know her name...!?) Grey: I heard you were working under her for a little while. Phoenix: Well, yes... I mean... Hey, wait a second here! I worked UNDER her!? Grey: Yes. Am I wrong? She told me, so I'm not quite sure if... Phoenix: Well, we worked a few trials together. But she went back to her hometown to undergo more training. Grey: Ah, yes, I heard. It must be lonely for you. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Wait... I'm not...! Grey: She must be an extraordinary girl to handle such rigid training. Phoenix: Huh? Grey: I have an acquaintance who knows a lot about these mystical sorts of things. She's the one who introduced me to Ms. Fey. Phoenix: (Is Maya... really that famous...?) Grey: And I've already set up an appointment. Phoenix: For what? Grey: What else!? A channeling! I'm going to have her call the spirit of that nurse that went and got herself killed! Phoenix: O-Oh. (Maya... I wonder what she's up to right now...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey clan have always been spirit mediums. (Changed from [We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums.] in the original release) It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (That's what she told me... I guess she's learned to accept her responsibilities and become an adult...) Grey: Not counting training, this will be her first time channeling a spirit, so she gave me one condition before accepting my request. Phoenix: A condition...? Grey: The condition is you, Mr. Wright. She said that she wouldn't do the channeling without first seeing you again. Phoenix: Me...? Grey: And that is why I've searched you out! You want to see her too, don't you!? Phoenix: (And so... that is how I ended up visiting Maya's hometown with the doctor...) June 19, 1:25 PMKurain Village Phoenix: (So this is Kurain Village; Maya's hometown.) ???: ... Phoenix: W-Why, hello there. ???: ... Phoenix: Hmm... What an odd little girl. ???: Hey! Wait up, Pearly!! Phoenix: (Hm? Someone else is coming this way...) ???: Niiiiiiiick! Phoenix: M-Maya. How are you...? It's good to see you again. Maya: Wow, I didn't think you'd really show up! Phoenix: It's not that big a deal. You made it sound like you were soooo far away. Maya: Well, maybe I exaggerated... just a little. Phoenix: It was only 2 hours by train. If I had known you were this close, I'd have visited more. Maya: No! You're not allowed. I already decided, you know. Until I become an adult, I have to work hard and be strong by myself... Phoenix: Oh... well... Anyway, congratulations. I'm glad to hear training is going well for you. Maya: Heh, heh... Examine Phone booth Phoenix: It's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. My cell phone doesn't get reception up here, so who knows. I may need it later. Bus shelter Phoenix: An old bus stop. It says \"Kurain Village\" on the sign post. The buses seem incredibly inconvenient since they only come 3 times a day. Giant rock Phoenix: A giant rock that seems to be reaching for the sky. Its origins are written on a beat-up, old sign. It looks like this giant rock is called the \"Kurain Boulder\". There's a really complex explanation written here, but long story short, it's a big stone for spirits to live in... Or something like that... Road and houses further Phoenix: Rustic, thatch-roofed houses where the other villagers live line the street. They're nowhere near as large or as nice as the manor in front of me. It's kind of odd that I don't see any of the other villagers walking around, though... Fey Manor Phoenix: The biggest, most elegant of the buildings I can see from here. This is Fey Manor; the place Maya calls home. It's easy to be overwhelmed by its presence... Talk Today's channeling Phoenix: Looks like you've finally become a full-fledged medium, taking on your first job. Maya: Yeah. I didn't think it would be this soon. Phoenix: But this case... Do you know the messy story behind it...? Maya: Ha ha ha, behold the power of the Maya Intelligence Network! Let's see. Fourteen people died because of malpractice on Dr. Grey's part, right? And to pin the blame on the nurse, he killed her in what appeared to be a car accident! Phoenix: Huh? Um, so what is this \"Maya Intelligence Network\" anyway...? Maya: The tabloids. Phoenix: That's what I thought. Maya: ... Ha ha ha. I'm just pulling your leg, Nick! What really happened is the exact opposite. I heard all about it from Dr. Grey. Phoenix: ... Maya: Oh, come on, Nick! I wouldn't take a crazed killer as a client! That's too scary, even for me. Phoenix: (Y-Yeah, I guess so.) Kurain Village Phoenix: So this is your hometown, huh, Maya? Maya: Yup! Kurain Village... But I've heard people call this place \"Medium Valley\", too. Phoenix: Interesting... So everyone that lives here is a spirit medium? Maya: Pretty much. Most of my ancestors were too, I think... Phoenix: (That's probably true since the Fey ability to communicate with the dead is so strong...) Maya: Actually, only the women of this village are mediums. Phoenix: So what do the men do? Maya: They usually work someplace outside the village. The girl earlier Phoenix: Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you about that girl I saw earlier. Do you know her? Maya: Oh, you mean Pearly? Phoenix: Pearly? Maya: Pearl Fey. She's my cousin. Isn't she adorable? Just like yours truly! Phoenix: Cousin... Wait, then that means... Is she also a...? Maya: Yup. She's a medium, too. Pearly's a real genius when it comes to channeling! Phoenix: Hmm, I see. I hope I didn't scare her when I tried to talk to her earlier. Maya: Nah, it's not you. My aunt drilled it into her head that \"if a suspicious-looking person tries to talk to you, run away\". Phoenix: S-Suspicious-looking...!? Maya: Well, you're not wearing training clothes, for starters... Phoenix: Of course not. Maya: Pearly is my aunt's most valued treasure, so she's not allowed to go outside of town. She doesn't know much about the world outside of Kurain Village. Phoenix: Aunt? Maya: Pearly's mother is my aunt, duh. Come on, Nick. Present Attorney's Badge Maya: Ah, it's good to see this tarnished badge again. Phoenix: What do you mean by \"tarnished\"...? Maya: Well, look. This badge is like every other. It's bound to lose its color and shine after years and years. But you know, polishing it up once in a while wouldn't be a bad idea. Maya Fey profile Maya: Ha ha ha. I'm warning you! I'm not the same weak Maya you knew a year ago, Nick! Phoenix: You seem to have a lot of faith in yourself. Maya: You'll see soon enough. I think you'll be totally shocked by how good my hamburgers are now! Phoenix: (Were you training to be a medium or a cook?) Turner Grey profile Maya: Hey, it's my client! Phoenix: \"Client,\" huh? You're really serious about your work, aren't you? Maya: I thought I'd say it once, just to try it out, like how you always say, \"My client.\" Any other evidence Maya: Hmm, nothing really comes to mind, Nick. Phoenix: Don't say that with such a big smile on your face. Maya: Ha ha. What can I say? I'm in a good mood today. Any other profile Phoenix: What do you think about this person? Maya: Hey, have I told you this one yet, Nick? We have a legend in this village. It goes like this. \"All the woman of the Fey clan are beauties.\" Well? Phoenix: ...And that's a legend now? After clearing all Talk options: Maya: Well, Nick, I've got to get going. It's about time for the channeling to start. Phoenix: Huh? Oh, yeah... Maya: I'm doing the channeling in my house, so come on in, OK? After I'm done, we can grill up some juicy burgers! Phoenix: Alright. Good luck, Maya. Maya: Thanks! Phoenix: (Well... At least she's still the same perky Maya.) June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Grey: Ah, Mr. Wright. I'm so glad you showed. Phoenix: Some nice weather we're having today. Aren't you happy? Grey: No, not at all. That stupid weather girl made the wrong call again. \"It will rain cats and dogs today!\" she said with a straight face. I can't believe they allow such misguided reports on the public airwaves! Phoenix: (Looks like talking about the weather with this guy is just asking for punishment...) Grey: ...But anyway, this is a splendid manor. Phoenix: (No argument there... It's hard to believe that this is Maya's house, though...) Grey: I was given a guidemap to this building. Here, Mr. Wright. I have a copy for you too. Guidemap added to the Court Record. Examine Door Phoenix: A door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. It looks like there is a strong lock on this door to top it off. Writing on top of the door Phoenix: Someone with a lot of skill wrote these four Chinese characters with a brush. Oh look, here's a translation: \"Once in a Lifetime.\" Its message is people should value their ghostly meetings as once in a lifetime chances. Blue board Phoenix: A piece of cloth with a ton of finely-written characters jammed onto it. Probably esoteric knowledge only mediums should know. ...Hmm, let's see... Here's one in English... It says... \"100 Ways to Save Money\". ... Being a medium sounds like a rough way of life... Door to the Winding Way Phoenix: This door leads out to the Winding Way. The weather outside looks really nice. Talk Today's channeling Phoenix: What are you going to do once the nurse's spirit has been called? Grey: Isn't it obvious? I'm going to have her write a signed confession. Phoenix: A signed confession? Grey: Yes, a confession. Pay attention! I'll have her write this: \"One year ago, on May 2nd, 14 patients died due to my negligence. And then, on May 24th, I fell asleep at the wheel and died in a car accident due to my further negligence. I'm sorry and I apologize for being negligent.\" That's what I'll have her write! With a confession, the rain falling on my soul can finally stop. Phoenix: O-Oh, I see... Maya Phoenix: So, how did you hear about Maya Fey...? Grey: I heard about her from an acquaintance; a girl studying the occult at the college. That girl introduced me to this village. This is the home of the Kurain School of Channeling. Phoenix: The home, huh...? Grey: And Ms. Maya is a daughter of the \"Master\", I hear. Phoenix: Master...? Grey: Anyway, do you see that door? That's the room where people and spirits meet. Ms. Maya's aunt is in there right now. Would you care to meet her...? Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Look, here's my attorney's badge. Grey: Are you trying to compete with me and my profession with that piece of scrap? Phoenix: ...Uh... Grey: I am a surgeon. Compared to you lawyers, I'm practically a saint! Yes, well, I don't exactly have any patients right now, but, and listen good! I'm not the one that made the mistake! Phoenix: (This doctor needs his head examined...) Guidemap (Fey Manor) Phoenix: Wow, this manor is really nice, don't you think? Grey: Do you honestly think this place is all that impressive? Don't make me laugh. Phoenix: Huh? Grey: This is the countryside. Land here is dirt cheap. I will have something much greater one day! I will build my own grand mansion! Did you hear me!? A grand MANSION! This manor will seem like nothing! Phoenix: (Uh, could you keep that shaking fist away from my face? Thanks...) Maya Fey profile Grey: She's still young, but one day, she'll bear a big responsibility. She'll be the Master, you know. The MASTER! Phoenix: (I guess there are \"Master\" mediums, too...) Morgan Fey profile Grey: That's Ms. Maya's aunt. Earlier, she made me eat some sort of traditional dessert the size of a tea saucer! Hmm, I wonder if Ms. Morgan ever performs channelings herself...? Any other profile Phoenix: What do you have to say about this person, Dr. Grey? Grey: ...This person... Hmm... Judging by their face... Phoenix: W-What is it? Grey: They have a weak stomach. Phoenix: R-Really... June 19Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: (Wow... It's such a strange atmosphere in here... These flickering lights... I guess they're candles...) ???: Good sir! Who might you be...? Phoenix: Aaah! I-I'm, uh, my name is Phoenix Wright... ???: Oh... You must be that good sir... Phoenix: (\"Good sir\"...? Is she talking about me?) ???: You are a lawyer, are you not, good sir? I have heard much about you from Mystic Maya. Phoenix: Is that so? (\"Mystic\" Maya...?) ???: I am Mystic Maya's aunt, Morgan Fey. Phoenix: N-Nice to meet you. Morgan: Ah, I had wanted to speak with you about a certain incident, good sir. It would seem that perhaps you ask too much of Mystic Maya in performing your duties. Most unbecoming, I'm afraid. Phoenix: Huh? Morgan: Don't tell me you have already forgotten? That was it not for Mystic Maya and her assistance, you would surely not have won... Phoenix: (First a girl that runs away, and now an old lady who says I stink at doing my job... When did I become the poster boy for \"How Not to Make a First Impression\"...?) Morgan: The past is the past though. Let us speak of the present now. Phoenix: ...Ah, thank you... Examine Door Phoenix: The Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. There is a giant iron lock where the handle is. It feels like a curtain that separates the normal world from the spirit one. Floor panels on left Phoenix: This is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air. Altar Phoenix: I guess this is an altar. Whatever it is, it feels very important. (Changed from [I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important.] in the original release) A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement. Morgan: Good sir! I wonder if you would please not touch the sacred objects. Those objects are being offered to the spirits. If you were to touch them, good sir, they would become cursed. Yes, cursed. Phoenix: (She really didn't have to talk down to me. I'm not that much of an idiot...) Folding screen Phoenix: This folding screen is really showing its age. All of its edges are a bit tattered. The lettering is fading too. I think I recognize a few of the characters on here... ...Ku ...ra ...in... I'm pretty sure that's what it says... Maybe I'll ask Maya about it later... Space behind folding screen Phoenix: There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. Talk Maya Phoenix: So why do you add \"Mystic\" to Maya's name. Isn't that a little... strange? Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Yes! Morgan: How dare you be so rude and disrespectful towards Mystic Maya! Phoenix: I-I'm sorry. Morgan: She must be addressed by her proper title, good sir. You must call her \"Mystic Maya\"! Phoenix: Um, uh... So, about Mystic Maya... Uh... Morgan: It is the blood. Phoenix: Excuse me? \"Blood\"? Morgan: Mystic Maya carries the blood of the Master. In actuality, she is the only one remaining. Phoenix: (Only one remaining...? What's that supposed to mean?) Morgan: Mystic Maya is the last of the rightful heirs of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: OK... Then... where do you stand...? Morgan: That is a little more complicated... Although a woman of the Fey family, I am merely a member of the branch family. Phoenix: ...Branch family? What's that? Morgan: It is as it sounds. For a member of the branch family, no matter her spiritual power, she can never become the Master of the Kurain School. Phoenix: So... how strong are you...? Morgan: ... It is a shame, however I will admit. I can not even begin to compare the lowliness of my power to the Master's. Phoenix: (So that's how it is...) Today's channeling Phoenix: So today's channeling will be her first? Morgan: Yes, good sir. Because the spirit of a person who dies in a traffic accident is usually very strong, it is usually easier to call that person to our world. Phoenix: (\"Traffic accident\" indeed.) Morgan: The channeling will take place here, in this Channeling Chamber, good sir. As you can see, I am in the process of preparing. Channeling Chamber Phoenix: So... this room is the... Channeling Chamber...? Morgan: The place where a spirit medium speaks with those who have departed. Phoenix: I don't suppose you'd mind if we observed the session... Morgan: Do not even think of such nonsense! Only the medium and the client may enter here. Phoenix: O-Oh. Morgan: The secrets of the Kurain Techniques can not be seen by just anybody. Phoenix: (That never stopped Maya from doing it in front of me before...) Morgan: It is also for your safety, good sir, if something were to go wrong. That is why, while channeling is being performed, that heavy door is securely locked... Phoenix: Oh, that's what the lock is for... Present Maya Fey profile Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Y-Yes! Morgan: When did you... take a hidden picture of Mystic Maya!? Phoenix: Wh-Wh-What!? Wait... It's not like that at all! Morgan: It is unforgivable! Phoenix: Ow-ow-ow! (Why did she slap me?) Turner Grey profile Phoenix: About this person... Morgan: Oh! It is that man, is it not? A man who wishes to borrow a departed spirit's power to hide the lack of his own. What an insignificant man. Phoenix: Insignificant...? Morgan: That would mean you are that man's insignificant little friend, dear sir. Phoenix: (Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?) Anything else Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Ack! Morgan: We would like to begin the channeling at 3 o'clock. If you don't mind, good sir, would you mind allowing me to make preparations? Phoenix: Uh, um, sure... go ahead... (She's a Fey alright! Just as odd as the rest.) After clearing all Talk options: Morgan: ... Oh, yes. I wonder if you have yet to meet Pearl, good sir. Phoenix: Pearl? Morgan: She is an adorable, angelic young girl. Phoenix: Oh, that odd... Morgan: She is my daughter. Now then, what was it you were about to say...? Phoenix: Wh-What a cute daughter you have... Ahaha... Morgan: A pure heart that knows not of the evils in this world is a powerful thing, good sir. Please refrain from affiliating with her, I request. Phoenix: (Well, it's not like I had the chance to anyway...) Morgan: I must insist and stress that you not let it occur. Phoenix: Okay, okay, I get it! June 19Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Wow. This garden is really breath-taking. Someone put a lot of love into it. What is that over there...? ...Is that an incinerator? It looks a little out of place in a garden like this...) Examine Garden Phoenix: A splendid garden with a small lamp and traditional decorations. It's a bit small to walk around in... Although, that incinerator piques my curiosity... Incinerator Phoenix: It's a small incinerator. I don't think garbage trucks come all the way out here to a little village like this. So every family has to burn their own trash. Side room Phoenix: It looks like there's a room over there, too. A peaceful feeling is emanating from it. Urn Phoenix: It's a really old urn. The ashes of a person long dead are inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on. June 19Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: (So this is... the Side Room. Looks like it's more of a break room. There is bedding spread out on the floor. It looks like someone's sleeping in one. I shouldn't disturb them...) Examine Wooden bear sculpture Phoenix: It's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. \"Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling\" What the!? It's a souvenir. So does this mean it's easy to spot bears here... And for them to spot you...? *gulp* Alcove Phoenix: It's a small alcove. I have no idea what it's supposed to mean or symbolize. If I had one of these in the office, it would end up as storage space. But here, it's decorated with some pretty flowers and a beautiful hanging scroll. Sliding door Phoenix: This is the first time I've seen a sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard. Bed on right Phoenix: There's bedding spread out on the floor. Is that someone sleeping in one over there? She's probably an exhausted medium taking a break and catching some z's. If I wake her up, she might be grumpy and throw a spell on me. It's probably a good idea to not disturb her sleep... Winding Way (after visiting Side Room and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber) ???: Hey! You! Hold on, now! This gal's got a few questions to ask! Phoenix: (Hmm... I'm sure I've heard that southern accent somewhere before...) ???: Oh, well I'll be! It's Mr. Phoenix Wright! How ya been!? Haven't seen you in, what, a year!? Phoenix: Um... You... are... uh... Lotta Hair Phoenix: Um, Lotta Hair, was it? ???: L-L-Lotta Who!? Wait, you best not be making fun of my hair, now! Phoenix: Ah, no, um, I wasn't \"making fun\"... I was \"complimenting\" you on your fine hair... ???: Hmph, I dare say yer one heartless man, Mr. Wright. It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty. But looks like you already forgot that. Phoenix: Hold up... you were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak... ???: Minor detail. Stop being so uptight; lettin' little things get in the way. The name's Hart. Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it! Phoenix: Oh yeah! That's it! Lotta: Now listen here. I'm here to take some pictures today. Gonna get myself a real scoop. Phoenix: Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean. Lotta: You betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous \"paranormal photographer\"!? Leads to: \"Oh, that's right!\" Lotta Hart Phoenix: You're Lotta Hart, right...? Lotta: Bingo! I'm the one and only \"paranormal photographer\", Lotta Hart! Phoenix: Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean. Lotta: Of course! And today, I'm gonna get myself a real scoop! You wait and see! Leads to: \"Oh, that's right!\" Who are you again? Phoenix: Sorry, but who are you again? ???: Oh Lawdy! I've met some cold men in my days, but you... You're in an icebox of yer own! Phoenix: Come on, am I really that bad...? ???: Put yer noggin to some use! You've gotta remember who I am! It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty. Phoenix: Ah! You're the one from that trial! ???: See, I knew you could remember if you tried! Phoenix: You were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak... ???: Why don't we let bygones be bygones, now. It's yesterday's news, right? Name's Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it, ya hear!? Phoenix: Um... So what brings you here today? Lotta: Hah! You should already know! I'm here for the big scoop! I can feel it! Phoenix: Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean. Lotta: You betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous \"paranormal photographer\"!? Leads to: \"Oh, that's right!\" Lotta: Oh, that's right! This ain't no time to be wastin' time! The channeling's about to get started! Phoenix: Is it that time already!? Lotta: We all should hurry up and get to the Meditation Room. ...What are you waiting around for!? Come on! Phoenix: (Lotta Hart, huh? I've been judging her harshly because of that case, but, I guess looking back, we had some good times, too...) June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Morgan: We will now begin the channeling. Mystic Maya and honored guest, please proceed into the Channeling Chamber. Grey: With this, I can finally swat all those pesky flies, once and for all! You hear me!? They won't be able to say a single bad thing about me after this! You would love to hear them apologize, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Me!? Oh, uh, yeah, I sure would. Morgan: Mystic Maya, do you have the Channeling Chamber key? Maya: Yup, right here. Morgan: That is most satisfactory. That key is one-of-a-kind, so please take care of it well. Maya: It'll be fine, Aunt Morgan. I won't lose it, trust me! OK, Dr. Grey. Let's get started. Grey: Finally! Let's go! *click* Morgan: Now let us wait patiently out here for them. Please have some lovely bitter green tea and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts... Lotta: Hold on, now, granny! Morgan: ...Granny? Lotta: How come we ain't allowed in that room!? Morgan: Dear madam, you have an \"impressive\" grasp of English. From where did you learn it? Lotta: What!? I'm from the heart of the heartland! Morgan: Is that so? Then I humbly request that you return to this \"Heart of the Heartland\". Lotta: Wh-What are ya...? Morgan: This is Kurain Village. If you can not follow our traditions and rules, we request that you leave! Lotta: ...! ... Sorry. Phoenix: (Wow. She shut Lotta up! Now THAT's impressive!) Morgan: Now then, let us wait. *BANG* Lotta: Hey now! Wh-What was that just now!? Phoenix: (It came from inside the Channeling Chamber...) *BANG* Lotta: Hey! Th-That's a gunshot! Morgan: E-Excuse me!? Lotta: I've heard that sound before. It's a gunshot! I'd bet my afro on it! Phoenix: (M-Maya! Maya's in there!) Break into the Chamber Lotta: Well, Mister Lawyer! What's the plan!? Phoenix: What else!? We're going to break in! Lotta: What!? But... But there's only one key and that kid's got it. Phoenix: We're going to have to break the door. Is that alright, Ms. Fey? Morgan: Well, yes... But there is one matter... That is... Phoenix: Don't try to stop me! You can send the repair bill to the Wright & Co. Law Offices later! Leads to: \"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\" Ask Morgan what to do Phoenix: Ms. Fey! What should we do!? Lotta: Yellow-bellied chicken liver! What are ya waiting for!? Kick it down already! Phoenix: But... The key... Morgan: That key is one-of-a-kind. In this world, there is only that one. Even I am powerless to open that door. Phoenix: (Hmm, there is really no other way...) Alright. Stand aside! I'm going to break the door down! Morgan: W-Wait! Please! That sort of recklessness... Leads to: \"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\" Lotta: Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man! *SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!* Phoenix: D-Dr. Grey!! *klik* ???: ...I... ...I was... murdered... Phoenix: M-Maya? ???: That man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him... Phoenix: Wh-What!? *klik* Phoenix: Lotta! At a time like this!? Lotta: Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!? Step away from there! Morgan: Please leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police! Phoenix: But, but... Morgan: Hurry! Before there are more victims here! Lotta: Hey, let's go, City Boy! Leave this to the granny! June 19Kurain Village Phoenix: (My cell phone doesn't get reception way out here... So I ended up using the phone booth to call the police...) Lotta: And...? Phoenix: They're on their way. Lotta: That's good. Lawdy, I saw a genuine \"mysterious phenomenon\"... Phoenix: (She seems really on edge because of all this... Not that I blame her... I'm scared to death by what's going on...) Talk What you witnessed Lotta: Hey, Mister. That gal... Maya. She wasn't the one that pulled the trigger, was she...? Phoenix: (Oh, yeah... Lotta doesn't know that when Maya is channeling, her whole physical appearance changes.) Lotta: Then again... Weren't there only the two of 'em in there? I reckon she musta done it then... Dr. Grey Phoenix: Lotta, what do you know about Dr. Grey? Lotta: Not much, but I did some digging... That's one gent with a bad reputation. Phoenix: Really? Lotta: I hear he's good at surgery and stuff, but his personality stinks like wet sheep. Phoenix: (I sort of got the same impression myself...) Lotta: He's real controllin'. Soon as his nurse or patients don't do what he says, he starts a-hollerin'. Musta been real rough to work for him. Present Anything Lotta: Hey, they'll be here soon, right? The police, I mean. I reckon you should be gettin' back to the crime scene, now. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess so...) June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Morgan: Ah, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Ms. Fey! How's, um... Mystic... Maya? Morgan: She has returned to \"this world\". The Spirit Severing Technique was successful. Phoenix: Let me see her, please! Morgan: She is still unconscious. I humbly request that you wait outside for her recovery. Phoenix: (Guess I just have to wait... *sigh*) Gumshoe: The police are here! Sorry to keep you waiting! Huh? ...You again!? Phoenix: What are you doing all the way out here, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: It's actually kinda funny. I was in the area for a business trip, pal. Well, time to check out the crime scene. I'll have to question everyone here later on, so just sit tight, alright? Phoenix: (Why is he grinning at me...?) Morgan: Shall I show you to the scene of the crime, Detective Gymshoe? Gumshoe: Um... My name isn't Gymshoe... Phoenix: (The two of them went into the Channeling Chamber... I guess all I can do for now is see what everyone else has to say...) June 19Kurain Village Lotta: ... Phoenix: (She's probably scared out of her wits after having a murder take place right near her.) Lotta? Lotta: GAWDDON'TLETITBEMENEXT! Phoenix: Eek! Don't scare me like that! Lotta: What do you mean!? Yer the one scaring me! If I weren't so tough, you'd have another dead body on yer hands -- mine! Talk Any ideas Leads to: \"Did you see or notice anything that stuck out at you?\" Present Maya Fey profile Lotta: Must be an awful thing to see each other again and have this happen. Never woulda guessed that gal would end up being a murderer. Phoenix: That wasn't Maya! She was being controlled by a spirit... Lotta: Come on, now, City Boy. Ya really think the cops'll believe that? Turner Grey profile Lotta: Hey, it's that Dr. Grey guy. Pity what happened to him. Pretty scary what ghouls and ghosts can do to a man, huh? Gawd rest his poor soul. Phoenix: (Hmm... Since when was Lotta so religious...?) Morgan Fey profile Lotta: That old lady sure can be forceful. She scared me back there. ...Well, only a little, now, ya hear? Dick Gumshoe profile Lotta: I swear I've seen his face before. Maybe during that last case... Whenever something happens, this detective guy is always there. I wonder if he's the real baddie behind everything? Phoenix: (Somehow, I highly doubt it...) Anything else Lotta: Nope. Don't know nothin' about that. Things that don't catch my eye, don't catch my interest. Phoenix: (And she calls herself a journalist??) Phoenix: Did you see or notice anything that stuck out at you? Lotta: Nah... Well, maybe one thing... Phoenix: What is it!? Lotta: Turns out my poor stomach's not good at handlin' this kind of thing. Phoenix: Huh-what? Lotta: Curses and ghosts and stuff comin' back to get ya... This is just too much, I say. Phoenix: What is too much? Lotta: Being an occult photographer. That's some scary stuff, so I think I'm gonna try being a celebrity photographer, now. Phoenix: Going after photos more within your reach from now on? More glamour, less gore? Lotta: ... Phoenix: What's up? Lotta: Oh, yeah! Phoenix: Wh-What is it? Lotta: I took some hot pictures earlier! Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: Remember!? I took some pictures at the murder scene inside! Phoenix: (Ack! She did! Two even!) Lotta: \"The Séance Murder\"... I sure like the ring of that. It'll be a sensational story! Phoenix: L-Lotta! Lotta: Sorry, but my journalistic sense is burnin' inside me! Hate to cut and run, but I'm headin' back in! Gotta beat those cops to the scoop of the century! UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhahahahahahahahahahaha... ... Phoenix: (I don't know who's scarier... Lotta or the spirits... And why does it feel like we've been through this before...?) June 19Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: (The police are busily running here and there, and I don't see Maya anywhere...) Gumshoe: H-Hey, you! Don't touch anything! Phoenix: Look, I really need to ask you some questions! Gumshoe: Umm... Don't look at me like I'm some sort of uncaring jerk... Tell you what, pal. I'll let you ask me a few questions, alright? Examine Anywhere Gumshoe: Hey, pal! No touching without my permission! Phoenix: I'm just looking at it. Gumshoe: Hey, I can't be too careful if a kid like her can be a murder suspect, now can I? Phoenix: (I guess if I want to search this room, I'm going to have to come back later...) Talk Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: I hate to break this to you, pal, but... with the way things look now, that girl's the only one who could've done it. Phoenix: (Yeah. Only Maya and the victim were inside this room, after all...) But Maya is... Gumshoe: You can ask more about her later, pal. Right now, I've got a job to do and that's collecting evidence. Phoenix: (Detective Gumshoe looks like a real professional. And yet, something about his expression still looks the same...) Cause of death Phoenix: So... Dr. Grey was shot with a gun, huh? Gumshoe: He was shot in the forehead. But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: But he was also stabbed in the chest with a knife. Phoenix: (...A knife?) Gumshoe: Basically, the vic was first stabbed, then he was shot. (Changed from [After being stabbed, the final blow was a shot from a gun.] in the original release) Present Anything Gumshoe: Ah, I'm really busy right now. I can take a look at it later, alright, pal? Phoenix: (He didn't even take a glance at it...) June 19Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: (Hmm, I'm pretty sure there was someone sleeping here earlier...) ???: Like, how can I help you? Phoenix: Ack! Ah, I'm, uh... That is... I... ???: Um, like, so isn't it about time to start? Phoenix: Huh? Time to start what? ???: You know, like, the channeling! Phoenix: Channeling...? Oh, oh, oh, oh!! No, actually, the situation has kind of changed... ???: Huh? Like, what do you mean? Phoenix: Please stay calm, but... there has been a murder! (Changed from [Please stay calm, but... a murder has taken place!] in the original release) ???: ... Um, so, like... A murder is that thing where, like, one person kills another, right? Phoenix: Yes! A person has killed another person! ???: Oh, that's... Uh... What are the words I'm looking for...? It's like... ...like totally a bummer. Phoenix: ...Yeah... (After all that effort, that's all she had to say?) ???: Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to, like, introduce myself. Ini: My name is Ini Miney. Um... At the college, I'm researching and studying \"parapsychology\". Phoenix: \"Parapsychology\"? Ini: That's right. Um... I think people, like, usually call it, \"occult studies\" or something. Like supernatural phenomenon, ESP and psychic powers. That sort of stuff. Phoenix: (That's pretty out there...) I'm Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. Examine Bed on right Phoenix: You left the blanket a mess. Are you going to fold it? Ini: Like I had a really good nap, and, like... I was thinking of leaving it like this, so, like, it's all set for tonight. Talk Ini Miney Phoenix: So what brings you here today? Ini: Um, like, so... I was the one who told Dr. Grey about this place. He asked me, like, \"Do you know of a good spirit medium?\" Phoenix: (Hmm, Dr. Grey did say something about being introduced to this place.) Ini: Cause, like, talking to dead people and, like, multiple personalities are my thing... Phoenix: I see... Then why were you taking a nap here? Ini: Like... I wasn't feeling good. Phoenix: Huh? Ini: I'm, like, allergic to sesame seeds. They, like, must've put some in the food they served for lunch. Phoenix: Oh, that doesn't sound fun. Ini: So I, like, felt sick, and came in here to, like, sleep. I totally feel, like, I've wasted my time 'cause I, like, slept a long time. What happened Phoenix: So you were sleeping here the entire time? Ini: Yeah. Ever since lunch... Phoenix: So you don't know anything about the murder that took place? Ini: Like, what? Oh, that! I, like, totally know nothing. So who was, like, you know, killed...? Phoenix: The surgeon that requested the channeling, Dr. Grey. Ini: ... The victim (appears after \"Ini Miney\" and \"What happened\") Phoenix: You and Dr. Grey knew each other, right? Ini: ...! I don't know any Dr. Grey! Phoenix: Oh really...? Then what was all that talk about him earlier? (Changed from [That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...] in the original release) Ini: Huh!? ...Well, uh... Like, a long, long time ago... I was, like, a patient, yeah. Phoenix: (She sounds like she's trying to hide something...) Present Maya Fey profile Ini: Oh, hey! That's, like, Maya Fey, right? She's, like, totally waaaay famous! Like, well, for people like us, like, you know? Phoenix: (\"Waaaay famous\"? Maya?) Ini: I mean, like, she's, like, the daughter of the Master, right? Phoenix: (Hmm... Well, at least she remembers some things.) Ini Miney profile Ini: Um... This face... Like, I think I've seen it somewhere before... Phoenix: What!? ...Y-You're joking, right? Ini: Ha ha, like, of course I am, silly! Phoenix: (Oh, thank goodness...) Any other evidence Ini: Like, I'm really sorry, but I'm not all that smart... so I don't, like, get it. Phoenix: (Hmm. Why does it feel like she's just putting on an act?) Any other profile Ini: I'm, like, totally bad at remembering people's names. Phoenix: Oh? Ini: But I, like, remember seeing that face somewhere before, like, I think... Phoenix: Well, thanks for trying. (I didn't think it was possible for someone to be this much of an airhead...) June 19Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (There's no one here... as usual.) Ack! ...H-Hey... How are you? Pearl: ... Phoenix: You're Pearl, right? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Hmm. Silent as ever... ...? What's that she's got in her hand? I've seen it somewhere before...) Talk Any option Phoenix: Um... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: (...What is it!? Is it my hair? Is it too spiky? Not spiky enough!?) Present Anything Phoenix: Um... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: (...What is it!? Is it my hair? Is it too spiky? Not spiky enough!?) After clearing \"Any ideas\" Talk option in Kurain Village and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber and Fey Manor - Side Room: June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Morgan: Oh, dear madam... You have such impeccable timing. Ini: Like, what's all the buzz? Gumshoe: Ahem. Alright everyone, listen up! You too, pal! I'm going to give you all a brief update! Right now, it looks like the investigation's not going to be done until real late... Morgan: That is a terrible shame. I propose that everyone sleep here under the roof of the Fey Manor tonight. Phoenix: (What a mess. I can't believe how crazy this day turned out... Maya was arrested and taken away by the police. And I don't see myself getting any sleep tonight...) June 20, 8:02 AMFey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: (*yawn* Uuugh... Morning... I guess I must have nodded off at some point... I hope Maya's OK. I should hurry and get to the Detention Center, ASAP!) June 20, 10:34 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: N... Nick! Nick! I...! Phoenix: Maya! Maya: What am I going to do!? I never imagined it would turn out like this! Phoenix: Calm down, Maya! Take deep breaths. (Come to think of it, the first time I met her... It all started right here, in this detention center...) Maya: I finally... I finally get to see you again, and... Phoenix: It's not your fault. You didn't do it. Maya: No, I... I did it... I killed that person. Phoenix: But that wasn't you. Maya: It doesn't matter. It might as well have been me. I was too weak... and I... I couldn't control the spirit's power, so... Phoenix: (I don't want to bring up the case quite yet, but...) Maya: ...You don't have to be nice to me. I understand. Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. I wonder if he's bored. Not that I can tell since he never looks over this way. Talk Channeling Phoenix: So you're the Master or something of the Kurain School of Channeling...? Maya: Actually, my mother is for now. But since that title is passed from mother to daughter, I guess I will be someday... Phoenix: But many people think that channeling isn't real, that it's all just an act. Maya: You believe in us, don't you? Phoenix: Yeah... because I've seen it with my own eyes. (When Maya's channeling a spirit... not only her voice, but her whole physical appearance changes. It's a supernatural phenomenon that occurs every time. It happened this time, too... Dr. Grey said that he wanted to call the nurse, so... Maya's body must have taken on that nurse's appearance...) What happened Phoenix: What exactly happened in the Channeling Chamber? Maya: ... I went into that room with Dr. Grey, locked the door... and sat down across from him. Phoenix: OK... Maya: We closed our eyes...and I began the channeling. Phoenix: (This is sounding kind of creepy... like the beginning of a scary story...) Maya: And that's the last thing I remember... Phoenix: What? Maya: After a spirit comes into my body, I lose my self, my consciousness. Phoenix: Then, you don't remember a single thing? Maya: When I came to, I was being held in my aunt's arms. And there was blood... all over my clothes. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Maya: Oh! But... I do remember having a dream. Phoenix: A dream...? \"Dream\" (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: What kind of dream did you have while you were channeling...? Maya: Um... I can't remember it all that well, but... I was dead and buried in the ground. I couldn't move... and it was unbearable... Really suffocating... ...It went something like that. Phoenix: I... I see... (I have no idea what to say to that...) Maya: There was a really familiar smell too... Phoenix: Under the ground? Maya: Yeah, I can't quite place it, but I know I've smelled that same scent before... Present Maya Fey profile Maya: I... I can't face myself... Phoenix: (I should've known better...) Turner Grey profile Maya: !! T-The... That's the guy I k-killed... Phoenix: Ack! I'm sorry! (Why did I pull this picture out!?) Pearl Fey profile Maya: Pearly... She definitely has more than me... Phoenix: Huh? What are you talking about? Maya: Who I think the next Master should be... I mean, she's got more spiritual power than me, and she really works hard at her training... Phoenix: (Talk about bringing the mood down even further... *sigh*) Morgan Fey profile Maya: I... I can't face my aunt right now... Not now... that this has happened... Phoenix: It's alright, Maya. I'm sure she understands. She's on our side, after all. Maya: Yeah, I know... But still... Lotta Hart profile Maya: That's Lotta Hart... right? Phoenix: That girl is still after the next sensational photo. Maya: Ha ha. I guess some things never change. Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: I felt terrible during the questioning session... I mean, Gumshoe kept looking at me... with these really sad eyes... ... Any other evidence Maya: Sorry, Nick, but there's nothing really special about it. Any other profile Phoenix: So... what do you think about this person...? Maya: ...? Phoenix: (I guess I can't expect her to know anything about this person.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... (...I guess this is about all the information I'm going to gather for today...) I'll be back later, Maya. In the meantime, please make sure you prepare it, OK? Maya: Huh? \"It\"? What is \"it\"? Phoenix: The document requesting me to be your attorney, of course. Maya: ...! But... Phoenix: What's wrong? Maya: Are you sure? I mean, I'm guilty! I'm a murderer! Phoenix: No one's decided that yet. Maya: But I did! I killed that person... with these... two hands...! Phoenix: That's enough, Maya. Maya: It's hopeless! If you defend me, you'll lose, I'm sure... Phoenix: Stop it! Maya: ... ...Help me... Nick, help me... I'm scared... Phoenix: Don't worry, I will. When is the trial? Maya: It sounds like tomorrow. Phoenix: (As usual, zero prep time...) Alright. I'm going now. Maya: Wait. Phoenix: ...? Maya: This jewel... This is called a Magatama. It's a magical charm and it's always protected me. Give this to Pearly... And I'm sure she'll lend you her spiritual powers. Magatama received from Maya. Present Maya's Magatama Maya: Make sure you show that to Pearly, OK, Nick? I'm sure she'll be a big help to you. June 20Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Phew. It feels like I've been gone forever. But it's only been one day... (Oh, that's right!) Where's that newspaper Dr. Grey brought the other day...? ...Ah, here it is. Right on top of my desk. (This is the only thing he left behind that's going to be of any help...) Newspaper Clipping 1 added to the Court Record. Examine Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Until recently, it had been a normal, business-class hotel. Houseplant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. It's a memento of my boss, Mia... who passed away. The rest of the room may be in shambles, but I always manage to care for this little fella. Poster Phoenix: A poster of the TV action hero, the Steel Samurai. Maya stuck it up here right before she left. I wouldn't say that the Steel Samurai and an attorney's office are a good match, but Maya threatened to curse me with some magic spell... so I guess it can stay. Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long, a layer of dust has started to form. One of these days, I should try to build up the courage to read one... Maybe. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I keep it neat for those rare occasions when I actually have a client in the office. After visiting Wright & Co. Law Offices or Kurain Village: June 20Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (Maya must still be in questioning... I hope the detectives are taking it easy on her, but... these kinds of cases aren't taken lightly. I guess I'll come back later.) June 20Kurain Village Phoenix: (I have to save Maya, no matter what! It's her life on the line! What in the world happened in that room yesterday?) June 20Fey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: (The Meditation Room nurtures all mediums young and old. Even mediums in training, I'd wager. But it's pretty deserted today... ...probably because of the murder yesterday...) June 20Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today... I should take this chance and thoroughly check this room. If I'm lucky, I might uncover a clue or two... Morgan: Oh, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Good morning. Morgan: I am on my way to go meet Mystic Maya, and I thought to bring her some items to make her feel more at home. Namely, tea so bitter you lose your tongue and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts. Phoenix: I'm sure Maya will be very grateful... Morgan: That's \"Mystic Maya\", good sir! Phoenix: (Urk. She is one scary lady.) Morgan: Oh, dear, sweet Mystic Maya... Pearl wept constantly for you last night, as did I. Phoenix: (I know it's important for me to search the site, but I should ask her some questions too, while I have the chance...) Examine (left side) Door Phoenix: The Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. The lock on it is broken, because, well... I broke it. It doesn't seem possible, but I managed to break it pretty badly. When we want to do something bad enough, people can do the most amazing things. Floor panels on left Phoenix: This is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air. No matter what I do, my eyes keep getting drawn to the pool of blood in the center here. Altar Phoenix: I guess this is an altar. Whatever it is, it feels very important. (Changed from [I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important.] in the original release) A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement. I'd guess they're used during the channeling... Folding screen Phoenix: It's a beautiful and expensive folding screen. It also looks quite old. There seems to be some sort of sacred text written on it, but I can't read it. ... ! Th-This is... It's a hole! Could this have been made by a bullet? Folding Screen added to the Court Record. Space behind folding screen Phoenix: There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. I hope no one is hiding back there. Talk What happened Phoenix: I would like to ask you a few questions about what happened yesterday. Morgan: Do you mean that awful tragedy? ???: That man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him... Phoenix: M-Maya? Step away from there! Morgan: Please leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police! Phoenix: What happened here in this room after I left? Morgan: Well... First, I struck Mystic Maya on the head. Phoenix: To make her go unconscious, correct? Morgan: That is correct. Next, I performed the Spirit Severing Technique. Phoenix: \"Spirit Severing Technique\"? Morgan: The spirit of that nurse was inside of Mystic Maya's body. I used the technique to send the nurse's spirit back to the other world. Phoenix: (I wonder if this kind of testimony is even admissible in a court of law...) Channeling Chamber Phoenix: By the way, what is this room exactly...? Morgan: The Channeling Chamber? This room was created for the sole purpose of preventing such a tragedy as yesterday. Phoenix: What do you mean? Morgan: Sometimes, when an inexperienced medium calls an especially strong spirit, that spirit may become violent and revolt, as you witnessed yesterday. Phoenix: Revolt? But how? Morgan: When a spirit enters a medium's body, she loses her will and her self steps aside. To put it another way, the spirit is borrowing the medium's body, good sir. Phoenix: But isn't that extremely dangerous? Morgan: An experienced medium has little problem controlling a spirit. Phoenix: But Maya... I mean, Mystic Maya... That was her first channeling... Morgan: And that was why I insisted on locking the door. However, I never thought that would be calling danger upon the client himself... I am grateful that one of our heirlooms was not damaged in this horrible incident. Phoenix: And that would be...? (Changed from [And that is...?] in the original release) Morgan: That folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings. (Changed from [It is that folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings.] in the original release) Along with the Kurain Sacred Urn, they are this village's most treasured possessions. If I ever found out that something had happened to either one... Oh, the inhumanity... Phoenix: (Odd for her to be worrying about the folding screen at a time like this... I guess this isn't just some dilapidated old screen after all...) Pearl Phoenix: So... How is Pearl today...? Morgan: Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Morgan: In this world, Pearl is my most treasured possession. When compared to even Mystic Maya, Pearl has the spiritual power to become a Master. Phoenix: Th-That's very impressive. Morgan: Until now, the women of the branch family have thought themselves to be inferior. .. But. Pearl is different! Her spiritual strength is so great; even greater than some of the main family! Yes, Pearl is a channeling prodigy and is the pride of the branch family! Phoenix: (Wow... She's really fired up now...) Morgan: In any case... Our world is so different from yours, perhaps it is best for you to quit, good sir. Phoenix: \"Quit\"? Quit what? Present Maya's Magatama Morgan: ...Oh my! Phoenix: Wh-What is it? Morgan: That... That is Mystic Maya's Magatama. Why would you have this in your possession!? Phoenix: I-I'm sorry! Morgan: Return it to Mystic Maya at once! Phoenix: Y-Yes, madam! (Why did I feel like I was being scolded by my own mother just now...?) Folding Screen Morgan: Ah, so even someone such as yourself can take interest in something like this. This is the Kurain Channeling Technique Sacred Writings. There are 6 panels in all. Phoenix: I see... But that's not what caught my eye. You see this hole here...? Morgan: It is an old screen, you see. It is only logical that perhaps a bug or worm of some sort is the culprit. Phoenix: (Even though this looks nothing like the eating patterns of any bug I know...) Maya Fey profile Morgan: I can hardly believe Mystic Maya has become like this. Directly influenced by the likes of you, and becoming caught up in a situation such as this... Phoenix: I'm sorry... (...Hey, hold on! How is all this MY fault!?) Morgan: I told her so many times, as I have also told Pearl, \"Do not associate with strange old men you don't know\". Phoenix: (Well, that shouldn't apply to me then, especially since I'm hardly an \"old man\" yet!!) Turner Grey profile Morgan: That doctor was one of those people. Those who intend harm upon the spirits receive harm in return; it's karma at work. It seems that he was the one to take the nurse's life, wouldn't you agree? Phoenix: (I guess that's possible...) Pearl Fey profile Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Y...Yes? Morgan: When did you take this picture!? This is one of those... what are they called...? Those... \"hidden camera\" pictures! Phoenix: N-No!! It's not one of those at all!! Morgan: Such an unforgivable offense! You will hand it over to me! Phoenix: N-No! I won't! (If I ever want to talk about Pearl again, I should be much more careful...) Morgan Fey profile Morgan: It shows the same face as the one I see in the mirror every day. Phoenix: And? Anything else? Morgan: No. That is all. Phoenix: (Why in the world did I bother to show this to her!?) Any other evidence Morgan: I will be leaving shortly to meet with Mystic Maya. I simply do not have the time to look at such trivial matters. Any other profile Morgan: We usually do not welcome strangers into our village as they disturb the aura here. Especially people like you, good sir. Phoenix: H-Hey, what do you mean, \"especially people like me?\" Morgan: You selfishly make Mystic Maya help you with your work... You should be thankful I have not taken your life for such a disrespectful act. Phoenix: Y-Yes, madam... Morgan: And even more importantly, remember that if anything were to happen to Pearl... Phoenix: (What is that supposed to mean!?) After clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen: Morgan: Well, then, I do believe it is time for me to take my leave. Phoenix: Alright. Please tell Maya I said hi. Morgan: What was that!? Phoenix: Uh, I mean, Mystic Maya. Morgan: I will tell her. Phoenix: (...*sigh*) June 20Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Little Pearl isn't here today... Maybe she's at school?) June 20Fey ManorSide Room Ini: Oh, hey! Like, you're that guy from yesterday... The, uh, dentist guy... Phoenix: No, no, I'm a lawyer. Ini: That's right! Um... Mr. Smith, Esquire. Phoenix: ...That's \"Wright\". Wait, I mean, you're wrong. My name is \"Wright\". Ini: \"Smith\", \"Wright\"... Well, I got, like, three letters, at least. Phoenix: (I don't think she gets the point...) Anyway, why are you here? Ini: So, like, I study this thing called \"parapsychology\" at this college and... Phoenix: Um, you told me about that yesterday. The sesame allergy, too. What I'd really like to know is why you're still here today? Ini: Oh! So, like, that's what you meant! Like, you shoulda been more, like, clear about it! Phoenix: S-Sorry. My bad. Ini: No, it's OK. Like, it's really... Phoenix: ... Ini: ...? Phoenix: ...That's it? Why'd you stop mid-sentence!? Ini: Did I? ...So, like... what was I talking about again...? Phoenix: ... (If Lotta ever wanted another \"genuine mysterious phenomenon\", it's right here.) Examine Wooden bear sculpture Phoenix: It's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. \"Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling\" What the!? It's a souvenir. Ini: Isn't it cuuuuute? I, like, totally bought that! Phoenix: Ah... so it's yours, huh? Ini: Yeah. So, like, this village is really famous for, like, channeling and bears. Phoenix: Heh. (...Wait. Famous for bears!?) Ini: But it's, like, OK. If you ever, like, see a bear, you just play dead, and they, like, leave you alone. Phoenix: I-Is that right? Ini: Yeah. Cause, like, fighting back is totally of no use. Phoenix: (Has she actually tried to fight one!?) Yellow box Phoenix: Hmm, now where did this box come from? I'm sure this wasn't here last night. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom. Talk Ini Miney Phoenix: So? Why are you still here today? Ini: Like, there's so much for me to, like, study here! Phoenix: Like what? Ini: Like, the medium's training, or like, how they inherit their spiritual power. Phoenix: (I suppose... This village is the real thing, after all.) Ini: So, like, I asked if I could stay here for, like, a little longer. Phoenix: (She sure seems like the care-free type, at least, on the surface...) What happened Phoenix: Have you heard about the murder? Ini: It's, like, totally scary. Phoenix: (...she says, with a silly smile plastered on her face...) ...So do you know anything about it that might help? Ini: ... Phoenix: (Somehow, I don't think she has a grip on reality, let alone what's going on here.) The victim Phoenix: About the victim, Dr. Grey... Ini: I don't know who you're talking about. ...Like... Wait, I think you asked about him, like, yesterday, too... Phoenix: (That's right... Her reaction yesterday when I asked was...) Phoenix: You and Dr. Grey knew each other, right? Ini: ...! I don't know any Dr. Grey! Phoenix: Oh really...? Then what was all that talk about him earlier? (Changed from [That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...] in the original release) Ini: Huh!? ...Well, uh... Like, a long, long time ago... I was, like, a patient, yeah. Phoenix: (OK, she is definitely hiding something from me...) Ini: ...Like, is something wrong? Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Would you take a look at this? Ini: Hey! It's, like, one of those little badges people in Congress all wear... Phoenix: No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. L-A-W-Y-E-R!! Ini: ...? Like, so is that what you are? Maya's Magatama Ini: Wow! It's a Magatama! Aww, you shouldn't have! Phoenix: It's so totally not for you! Ini: Hey! Like, it's not nice to freak me out like that! Phoenix: (That should be my line...) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about this girl... Ini: Oh, that's, like, Maya Fey. She's, like, the Master's daughter. Phoenix: You surprise me. You knew that? Ini: Well, like, I totally know everyone related to the occult. Maya is, like, an idol among spirit mediums. Phoenix: (Maya an idol? I guess stranger things have happened.) Morgan Fey profile Ini: That's Morgan Fey. Like, she's been totally helpful. Phoenix: (Did she just bow to the picture...?) Ini: So what about her? Phoenix: Oh, nothing in particular. I just wanted to know what you knew about her. Ini: Um... Well, she's, like, a really good person. Phoenix: I see. Ini: Like totally. Phoenix: OK. (This is going nowhere...) Ini Miney profile Ini: Um... This face... Like, I think I've seen it somewhere before... Phoenix: What!? ...Y-You're joking, right? Ini: Ha ha, like, of course I am, silly! Phoenix: (Oh, thank goodness...) Any other evidence Ini: Like, I'm really sorry, but... And I know, like, you totally had your heart set on it, but I can't, like, take it. Phoenix: (Who said anything about giving this to you!?) Any other profile Phoenix: What do you know about this person...? Ini: I'm, like, sorry, but it's totally, like, time for my nap... Phoenix: *yawn* (Ack! She's even got ME yawning!) Ini: And I, like, totally don't care about that person anyway... After clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber, and clearing \"The victim\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Side Room: June 20Fey ManorWinding Way Pearl: ... Phoenix: Ack! Y-You surprised me! Pearl: ... Phoenix: And how are you today? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Hmm... I guess she isn't open to friendly chatting... Huh? She's still holding something in her hand... ...It looks like the same thing she had yesterday...) Talk Any option Phoenix: Um... Pearl: Aaaah! Phoenix: H-Huh?? (If only I had something that would catch her interest. Maybe then she'd talk to me.) Present Maya's Magatama Leads to: \"Oh yeah. Maya said to give this to you...\" Anything else Phoenix: Can you take a look at this? Please? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Urk... She's really scrutinizing my face...) Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Th-That's enough already! I'm not that shifty-looking, am I!?) Phoenix: Oh yeah. Maya said to give this to you... Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Ack! I'm in trouble now!! If Morgan sees us like this, I'll be the next one they're channeling...) Pearl: Th-That's... That's Mystic Maya's... Phoenix: ...Huh!? (Sh-She actually spoke!) Pearl: Who are you...? Phoenix: I-I'm Phoenix Wright. I, uh, worked with Maya... Pearl: ...Y-You worked with Mystic Maya...? You... You're Mr. Nick, right? Phoenix: ...Uh, excuse me? (I bet I know who she picked \"Nick\" up from...) Pearl: I know who you are. You're... You're Mystic Maya's... \"special someone\"... Phoenix: WH-WH-WH-WHAT!? Pearl: So then... Of course! You're going to help Mystic Maya, aren't you? That's what you're going to do, right? Phoenix: W-Well, yeah... I will... Pearl: Oh wow... It's like a beautiful fairy tale! That earnest look shining brightly in your eyes... It must be true love... Phoenix: ...Wh-What!? (Why am I being boiled into a bright red lobster by this little kid!?) Pearl: I'm so jealous of Mystic Maya! Ah, what a wonderful relationship... Phoenix: W-Wait... I... uhh... I mean... We aren't... Things aren't like... Pearl: Hee hee, I can tell you're a good person. Alright, Mr. Nick! I may be small, but I'm going to help you in any way I can! Talk Pearl Phoenix: Pearl, are you friends with Maya? Pearl: I feel very grateful to be friends with her... She's so great. I want to be like Mystic Maya when I grow up. I really look up to her. Phoenix: Wow, I had no idea Maya was so... revered. Pearl: Usually when people don't use Mystic Maya's title, I get mad. Phoenix: O-Oh, sorry. Pearl: But if it's you, Mr. Nick, then it's OK. Because... Because... you're \"special\" to her. Phoenix: (Where in the world did she get an idea like that??) Pearl: By the way... this may be rude, but which channeling school are you from? Phoenix: Which channeling school? Pearl: Yes. For example, I study the Kurain technique. Phoenix: ... Ah, I get it! No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. A lawyer. Pearl: ...Law...yer? Phoenix: Yup. Pearl: ...Is that related to spirit mediums in any way...? Phoenix: (Um... None that I know of...) Wait, are you telling me you don't know what a lawyer is? Pearl: I'm sorry, but I have no idea. Phoenix: (Maya did say Pearl doesn't know much about the outside world...) The item in your hand Phoenix: So what's that you've got there, Pearl? Pearl: Oh, this? I found it yesterday. Phoenix: Hmm... Pearl: If you want it, I can give it to you. Accept it Leads to: \"Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me...\" Don't accept it Phoenix: I can't take something this important from you, Pearl. Pearl: Oh... Phoenix: (But I'm sure I've seen that key somewhere before... ...and it might be an important clue later on...) Leads to: \"Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me...\" Phoenix: Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me... Pearl: Hee hee. You look like a child at a toy store, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (...She not only speaks in a refined manner, but laughs in one, too!) Black Key added to the Court Record. Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: So this is... Pearl: That is Mystic Maya's Magatama. It's one of the most important heirlooms of Kurain Village. Please make sure to take good care of it. Phoenix: Y-Yeah, I will. (Is it really OK for me to have such a priceless object?) Folding Screen Pearl: Are you interested in Kurain's traditional things too, Mr. Nick? The Kurain Sacred Writings are on this folding screen. Phoenix: Oh? Is that what's written on it? Actually, what caught my eye was this \"hole\" in it... Pearl: It's a very old screen, so I think that maybe bugs made it by eating through it. Phoenix: (...It sure doesn't look like something bugs can make...) Black Key Phoenix: About this key... Pearl: I found it while I was playing in the garden yesterday. Phoenix: I've seen it before too, you know? Pearl: ...? Really? Maya Fey profile Pearl: I look up to Mystic Maya a lot. She's my role model. She's so smart, and pretty, and kind, and loving. She's always cheerful, never gets sick, isn't picky, and has good sleeping habits. She always wakes up before me, and always eats breakfast before me too. And she has you; such a wonderful person with whom she can share a lo- Phoenix: Ack! OK, OK! I get the idea! (She really thinks the world of Maya, doesn't she?) Pearl Fey profile Pearl: To tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother won't let me. Phoenix: Your hair now suits you quite well, though, I think. Pearl: R-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget* Phoenix: *fidget, fidget* Morgan Fey profile Pearl: Oh, it's my mother! She takes really good care of me and loves me very much. She says I'm the \"pride of the branch family\"... But I don't know what that means. Phoenix: (\"Branch family\"... That concept is probably still too hard for little Pearl...) Any other evidence Pearl: I'm sure it is helpful to you in some way, but I'm still in training, so I don't know anything about it. I'm really, deeply sorry. Phoenix: No, no, no, it's OK. I shouldn't have shown you something so trivial anyway. I'm very sorry. (This feels so weird, talking to a kid like this...) Any other profile Pearl: Hmm, I'm sorry I don't know who this person is. Phoenix: I guess that makes sense... You've never left Kurain village, after all. Pearl: I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick. I just don't really know anyone outside the village. After clearing all Talk options: Pearl: Um, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: Yes, Pearls? I can call you that, right? You're too cute to just call you Pearl. Pearl: Sure, Mr. Nick... Umm... Are you sure it's OK for me to have this Magatama? Phoenix: Yeah, it's OK. I was told to give it to you. Pearl: But, I can't accept something like this! ...All I really should do is charge this Magatama with spiritual energy... Phoenix: Spiritual energy? Pearl: Please take this. I'm sure it will be helpful. Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Pearl: It will let you see people's secrets. Phoenix: See people's... secrets...? Pearl: Yes. ...If it's alright with you, I would like to accompany you for a little while. I can explain the Magatama's power to you when we meet someone hiding a secret. June 20Fey ManorMeditation Room Gumshoe: Hey, it's you, pal! So you're going to be her lawyer, I bet. Phoenix: Yes. Gumshoe: Oh... I really feel bad for you, pal. Just this once, I wish I could be on your side. Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Yeah, but I shouldn't be saying that kind of stuff to you. Hey! You're a cute kid. Pearl: ... Gumshoe: Ha ha ha. I'm not scary. Honest! Phoenix: (Wow, I never knew Gumshoe liked kids...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! I know! I'll show you something cool! How's this? It's a real, genuine pistol... Phoenix: D-Detective Gumshoe!! What are you doing showing her something that dangerous! Gumshoe: Oh, sorry... Talk Maya's guilt Phoenix: What about Maya and the charges against her? Gumshoe: I don't think you can win, pal. If you're talking about proof, we've got a few pieces. Phoenix: You've got proof...? Gumshoe: Yeah, pal. That puffy-haired photographer's going to testify tomorrow. Phoenix: (He must be talking about Lotta. Actually... speaking of Lotta...) Lotta: I took some hot pictures earlier! Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: Remember!? I took some pictures at the murder scene inside! Phoenix: (Lotta's \"hot pictures\"... I wonder what her camera captured...?) Gumshoe: ...Besides, you must've realized by now, pal. There's no way anyone other than Maya Fey could've done it. Phoenix: (...!) Pearl: ... Phoenix: (What am I supposed to say to Pearls now...?) The victim Phoenix: About Dr. Grey... Gumshoe: The victim wasn't super famous, but people still knew who he was. His face was all over those tabloid shows last year. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Gumshoe: I was looking through some newspapers from last year, and... ... Huh? I could've sworn I had... I cut an article out, but I guess I must've lost it... Phoenix: (He's searching through his pockets... And boy, are those big...) Gumshoe: Hmm... It looked really interesting, too. Hey, do you have a copy, pal? Phoenix: (A copy of that article...? I think Dr. Grey might have brought a copy to the office when he came by...) Tomorrow's trial Phoenix: About Maya's trial tomorrow... Gumshoe: I've got two pieces of news for you, pal. Phoenix: Two? Gumshoe: Yeah. \"Bad news\" and \"even worse news.\" So which do you want to hear first? Phoenix: ...I don't really care... It doesn't change the fact that I'm not going to like it. Gumshoe: Alright, pal. Well, the prosecutor for the trial is Prosecutor von Karma. Phoenix: WHAT!? Von Karma!? Phoenix: (Manfred von Karma... He was an awe-inspiring veteran prosecutor. He never lost a case in the 40 years of his career, and he raised a fearsome disciple. The horrible aftertaste of the evil he force-fed me is something I'll never forget.) Phoenix: ... Wait a sec. But didn't Von Karma stand trial and... Gumshoe: That's where the other piece of bad news comes in... The Von Karma you're facing tomorrow is actually his successor... Phoenix: Successor...? Successor (appears after \"Tomorrow's trial\") Phoenix: So, um... Who is this \"successor\" to Von Karma? Gumshoe: Literally, pal, it's Prosecutor von Karma's kid. His kid became a prosecutor real young... like 13, and hasn't lost a trial since. That's what they call a \"prodigy,\" pal. Phoenix: Hmm... Kid, huh... ... W-W-Wait a sec! Th-Th-Thirteen!? The kid became a prosecutor at the age of THIRTEEN!? I mean, a prodigy like that... I would have heard something about... Gumshoe: Oh, no, no. The kid was born and raised in Germany, pal. That country's got a lot of stuff and is a great place to develop a person's talents. Phoenix: (Germany, huh? That's probably why I've never heard of this person. Ugh... Still, all it takes is someone mentioning the name \"Von Karma\", and I get terrible flashbacks to that case. Stop it! Get a grip on yourself, Phoenix! (Changed from [Stop it! Get over it, Phoenix!] in the original release) None of that matters anymore... now that he's gone... (Changed from [That person is already gone...] in the original release)) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Pearl: Uh, um... Mr. Nick? Phoenix: What is it, Pearls? Pearl: I was wondering if I could see it, too? Phoenix: Ah, no, it's OK. It's not that important anyway. Maya's Magatama Phoenix: What do you think about this...? Gumshoe: Hey, that's a pretty nice-looking brooch! You should stop wearing that ugly old attorney's badge, and start wearing that, pal. Pearl: Hee, hee. That detective is so nice! Aren't you happy, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (Happy?... About what?) Newspaper Clipping 1 Phoenix: Um, Dr. Grey brought this over to my office the other day, and... Gumshoe: Hey! It's that news story! The one about the malpractice suit! Phoenix: Fourteen patients died and it caused a huge stink. Gumshoe: Yeah, but that's not all, pal. Things only got worse after that. Phoenix: You mean the car accident the nurse died in? Gumshoe: ...Hmm... Oh, here we go. I brought my own clipping with me today. Here, pal, this is for you. Phoenix: Alright. Thanks. Newspaper Clipping 2 added to the Court Record. Newspaper Clipping 1 (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The nurse that killed the patients ended up getting killed in an accident. Dr. Grey wound up on a lot of tabloid shows because of that. Now, there was a smart man. I'm sure that was a great way to advertise for his clinic. Phoenix: (Uh, huh. Scaring people off is always the best way to get more patients.) Black Key Phoenix: So about this key... Gumshoe: Hey, is that your house key or something, pal? Phoenix: Come on, does this look like a house key to you? Gumshoe: Then what's it for? Phoenix: It's... ... (Hmm, actually, I should probably keep that a secret...) It's my bicycle key. Gumshoe: Oh. Nothing special, huh? Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: I'm sorry things had to turn out this way, pal. Phoenix: It's too early to give up! No one's proven her guilty of anything, yet! Gumshoe: Look, even if there were a zillion of you, pal, this is a case you... *sigh* Phoenix: (Now why is he sighing?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Oh, so that's little Pearl. Phoenix: Do you know her? Gumshoe: Only that Ms. Fey was looking for her earlier. Something about being worried that she'll end up talking to the weird guy. So, you have any idea who this \"weird guy\" is, pal? Phoenix: ...Nope. Not a clue. Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: That's Maya's aunt, right? I got to eat one of her giant strawberry desserts earlier. It was really good! Phoenix: (Aw, I didn't get to eat one yet...) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Boy do I look scary in this picture. I guess if I want people to stop thinking cops are scary, I have to change myself. Gotta smile, gotta smile! Phoenix: (There's that classic Gumshoe goofy smile again...) Any other evidence Gumshoe: Ooh, I'd better shut my mouth. Phoenix: Uh, what? Gumshoe: I'm not gonna give you any information about evidence, pal. Phoenix: Oh. Any other profile Gumshoe: I don't have anything to tell you about this one, pal. Phoenix: You don't have to be so mean about it. Gumshoe: Not. A. Word. Pearl: ... Gumshoe: H-H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Phoenix: (That girl has one intense stare... *gulp*) June 20Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: Hello again. We seem to be seeing a lot of each other today. Ini: Aww, she's, like, tooootally cute! Is she, like, your daughter? Phoenix: W-What!? NO! (How old do you think I am!?) Talk The victim Phoenix: I want to ask you about the victim, Dr. Grey. Ini: I, like, totally don't know him. 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: Aaack! What is that!? Ini: ...? Pearl: You can see it, can't you, Mr. Nick? You can see the \"lock\" on that person's heart. Phoenix: Huh, what...? Pearl: This is the power of the Magatama. Only you can see these \"Psyche-Locks\", Mr. Nick. Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks, huh...) Pearl: The more someone wants to hide their secret, the more locks you will see. If it's only one, I think you can easily unlock it. Phoenix: \"Unlock\"...? But how? Pearl: Please use Mystic Maya's Magatama on this person, and let's remove the lock. Phoenix: (I have no idea what she's talking about, but... Guess I'll give it a try.) Pearl: You must be careful, though, Mr. Nick. If you make a mistake, it will hurt you. If you don't think you have the proof you need, you must have the courage to stop. Phoenix: (Well, I've got to start somewhere. Let's give this Psyche-Lock thing a try.) The victim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Iim going to ask you again. Did you know Dr. Grey? Ini: I totally don't know that guy. Like, you're totally more presistent than a roach! 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (This girl is hiding something! I'm sure of it! I guess I have no choice but to remove this lock. Alright, so first, I have to use Maya's Magatama...) The victim (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Leads to: \"Please, tell me all you know about Dr. Grey.\" Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- The Victim -- Phoenix: Ini Miney. I believe you do know who Dr. Grey is! Ini: I told you! Like, how many times do I, like, have to repeat myself? If you're, like, so totally sure, then where's, like, your proof? Phoenix: While it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person, I do believe you might have at least, indirectly known of him. Ini: Like, what do you mean, like, \"indirectly\"...? Phoenix: (I should try to show that the possibility existed for now...) (Hmm, so, something that shows a possible connection between Ini and Dr. Grey...) Present Newspaper Clipping 2 Phoenix: Leads to: \"Take a look at this newspaper clipping.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here is your proof! Ini: Like, what is that...? Phoenix: Ouch... I guess it doesn't have anything to do with it, huh? (Pearls did warn me... \"If you make a mistake, it will hurt you,\" she said. If I don't have enough evidence, I should probably \"stop\". I should take another look at the Court Record and think it through one more time.) Leads back to: \"While it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person,\" Phoenix: Take a look at this newspaper clipping. Ini: Like, what is it? ... A story about an accident? Phoenix: Please read the victim's name. Ini: Um...\"Mimi Miney\"... Phoenix: \"Miney\" is a pretty rare last name, wouldn't you say? Ms. Mimi Miney wouldn't happen to be a relative of yours, would she? Ini: ...! So you noticed. Sh-She was my older sister. Phoenix: I'm sorry about your loss... Your sister... Was she a nurse... Perhaps at Dr. Grey's surgical clinic? Ini: ...! Phoenix: Grey Surgical Clinic... I don't think I need to tell you that the clinic was run by the victim, Dr. Turner Grey. Which is how you knew of Dr. Grey; you knew him through your sister! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Phoenix: Please, tell me all you know about Dr. Grey. Ini: My... My sister's name was Mimi Miney. She was, like, a nurse at Dr. Grey's clinic. Phoenix: (That's what I thought...) Ini: I heard that, like, Dr. Grey was really tough on people. Like, a total slave driver. My sis was, like, always coming home totally wiped out 'cause she was overworked. Phoenix: Wiped out? So is that why she fell asleep at the wheel? Ini: That guy, like, drove my sis so hard, so, like, that's why the accident happened. Phoenix: The one where 14 patients died from malpractice? Ini: Yeah, like, I think that was the doctor's fault, too. My sis was pushed by, like, everyone's expectations and, like, her duties and stuff. And that pushed her to her death. Phoenix: Oh... I'm sorry... Ini: So, like, are we done? I've, like, already told my story to, like, everyone... Pearl: Do you understand now, Mr. Nick? This is how a Psyche-Lock works. Phoenix: ...Well, I don't plan to pry into people's hearts unless I absolutely need to... Pearl: The lock this time was pretty easy, but... you might meet people who aren't as willing to give in later on. If you don't have enough proof, be careful and know when to stop trying. After clearing \"Successor\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Meditation Room and clearing \"The victim\" Talk option upon breaking Psyche-Lock in Fey Manor - Side Room: June 20Kurain Village Pearl: Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Hmm? What's wrong? Pearl: I have never left Kurain Village. Phoenix: R-Really? Wow, that's, um, pretty amazing... Pearl: You are going to meet with Mystic Maya... aren't you? Please tell her I said hi. Phoenix: Hey, wait! (She ran off... Again. Well, I know Ini's secret now, but... I still don't have any idea how I'm going to save Maya. I don't even know if I should go in there with a smile or a straight face... *sigh*) June 20Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (What am I supposed to do!? I'm almost out of time! Can I really do anything? Can I really save her...?) ???: Sorry to keep you waiting. Phoenix: (Huh? Must be Maya...) ???: It's been a long time, hasn't it, Phoenix? Phoenix: ...! (That voice...) M-Mia! Mia: Even without me being here, it looks like you've learned to stand on your own. Phoenix: (Mia... She's Maya's older sister, and my mentor. She was a top-notch defense lawyer, but a certain case forced her into \"retirement\". But... whenever I'm in trouble, she comes to help, just like this. Her spirit comes back from the other world and borrows Maya's body for a bit...) Mia: Phoenix, you can't make that kind of face in front of your client. Phoenix: ...! Mia: A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets, and especially when it's bad. Phoenix: Mia... Mia: You can't smile at the end if you haven't been smiling the whole way there. In any case, the face you're making now is no face to show a client, Phoenix. Phoenix: B-But! Mia: So, tell me all about it. I'm going to guess that my sister is in a lot of trouble again... Phoenix: (I told her everything about what had happened in the last two days. Mia closed her eyes, deep in thought, while she listened...) Mia: ...I see... Phoenix: Mia... What am I supposed to do? Mia: ... It's pretty clear what a good lawyer does in this situation. Phoenix: A-And that is!? Tell me, please! Mia: Believe in your convictions. And fight for the complete acquittal of your client. Talk Not guilty Phoenix: You think Maya's not guilty!? How can you be so sure!? Mia: I know she is. And I'll give you a hint as to why. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: Mediums can't have dreams. Phoenix: Can't have \"dreams\"...? Mia: From what you told me, it sounds like Maya was having a dream while channeling. Phoenix: Yeah... She said she dream that she had died and had been buried in the ground. Mia: But that is impossible. You've heard it from her, I'm sure. When a medium channels, her own spirit disappears. Which means that it's impossible for her to dream during that time. Phoenix: ...! Then... What does this mean!? Mia: I think it's safe to bet that Maya was set-up. Phoenix: A set-up!? Mia: It's up to you to blow the lid on this case tomorrow and show how she was set-up. Evidence? Phoenix: How am I supposed to prove her innocence when I have nothing to go on!? Mia: If you're looking for a clue, it's already in your hands. Phoenix: I-It is!? Mia: Just as it sounds, Phoenix, you already hold the \"key\". Phoenix: (R-Really...?) Mia: Come on, show me the \"key\" to this case. Phoenix: (The \"key\", huh? Alright, I'll show it to her; the \"key\" I hold.) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Mia... Mia: *chuckle* Wow, this badge brings back a lot of memories, doesn't it...? I would love to stand with you at the defense table one more time. Phoenix: (Mia...) Maya's Magatama Mia: This is... Maya's Magatama, isn't it? Why do you have it...? Phoenix: Maya gave it to me, but... Mia: I see... ... This is something very important to me. Take good care of it, OK? Phoenix: (She looks at it with such a soft look in her eyes...) Black Key Phoenix: Mia, have you seen this key before? Mia: Ahh, the key... It's literally, the key to understanding everything that's happened in this case. Phoenix: This key? Mia: Phoenix, listen. Right now, that key is sitting in your hand. However, it shouldn't be. ... It contradicts the \"facts\". Phoenix: (What does she mean...?) Mia: I'm certain this key will be the piece of evidence that makes your case tomorrow. Maya Fey profile Mia: I can't see Maya... when I'm in her body like this... But I can tell. She's very lonely and sad. Take good care of her, will you, Phoenix? Phoenix: I-I will... Pearl Fey profile Mia: Pearly! She's really grown up... I left Kurain Village a long time ago. She probably doesn't remember a thing about me by now... Morgan Fey profile Mia: I'm afraid I might have caused Aunt Morgan a lot of stress. When I left Kurain, I left Maya in my aunt's care. And now something like this happens... Dick Gumshoe profile Mia: I've seen this man somewhere before... He had a strange name... and I'm almost sure I've questioned him before. I remember him making a show of confidence at first, but after five minutes, he breaks down and... ...you end up feeling bad for the poor guy... Mia Fey profile Mia: That's right. I'm already dead. But I feel very grateful to have been born a Fey... so I can talk with you like this... Any other evidence Phoenix: Could you take a look at this? Mia: ...Do you have anything more useful? There's no time left. Try to show me something that will help you in tomorrow's trial. Any other profile Mia: I'm sorry, but I don't remember who that is... After clearing all Talk options and presenting Black Key: Mia: ... ... You already know everything you need to know. You know what the \"key\" to this case is... That is enough... Phoenix: But... But! How can I win tomorrow without knowing who the real murderer is!? Who... Who could have...? Mia: ... Phoenix: (I didn't know it at the time, (Changed from [At the time, I didn't know,] in the original release) but this day was going to end with a turn for the surprising...) 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: M-Mia!? Wh-What...!? Mia: What's wrong? Phoenix: (That's right. Only I can see the Psyche-Locks... Which means... Mia must know something about the real murderer! But for this to be something that she would hide under lock and key from even me... What in the world is going on!?) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!) Reunion, and Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 June 21, 9:48 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Maya: Whaaaaaaaat!? Prosecutor von Karma!? You mean...? Phoenix: No, I heard it's his successor this time... Maya: Successor...? ... Manfred von Karma... was a really sinister man. (Changed from [Manfred von Karma. He was a really sinister man.] in the original release) He pulled all sorts of nasty tricks; all so he could win. Phoenix: (He was a man obsessed with the word \"perfection\"... He had a perfect record... for forty long years. Who knows what sorts of dirty tricks he used to get each of those guilty verdicts? And now, his successor... I wonder what kind of person they will turn out to be...) Maya: It's no good... Mystic Maya!! Maya: Pearly! You showed up! Thanks for coming all this way! Pearl: I was really worried about you... Maya: Hey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together? Pearl: Mother is watching over the trainees. She said they have training for two days straight with no breaks. Maya: Huh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself? Pearl: Yup! I snuck out of the manor and followed a map. Phoenix: Don't tell me you walked all the way here... Pearl: Of course not! ...I ran! Phoenix: That's... I can't... Oh my... (If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...) Maya: Pearly... What about the train? Pearl: Huh? What's a... \"tray-in\"? Phoenix: (I give up...) Pearl: ...It's time, isn't it? Maya: Um... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma! Pearl: Mr. Eh-ji-werth? Who is that? Maya: Um, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend. I still remember him as though I'd seen him only yesterday. (Changed from [I still remember him as if I had just seen him only yesterday.] in the original release) Every trial was a scorchingly fierce battle until the very end. (Changed from [Every trial was a scorching fierce battle until the very end.] in the original release) It was always back and forth with them. But when you're rivals for life... Phoenix: Maya! Please don't mention that name ever again... Maya: Huh...? But why, Nick? Phoenix: I'm... I'm sorry, Maya. I forgot you don't know... He... He's... He's gone... And he's not coming back... Maya: Whaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!? Bailiff: Court will commence shortly. Please proceed into the courtroom. Phoenix: ... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway. Maya: N...Nick...? June 21, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey. Are the prosecution and the defense prepared? ???: ... Phoenix: ... (What is with this kid...?) (Changed from [... (What is with this girl...?)] in the original release) Judge: ... *Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you prepared!? (Changed from [*Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you finally prepared!?] in the original release) Phoenix: Huh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. (Why does he always seem mad at me!?) ???: Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: ...! ???: You must be a little shocked because I am a woman, correct? Phoenix: (...Hold on. So SHE'S the famed \"successor\" to Prosecutor von Karma...?) (Changed from [...Hold on. So this kid is the 'famed' Prosecutor von Karma...?] in the original release) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: Revenge...? (Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?) Judge: Um... If it's something of a personal nature, I'm sure you can... Oww! von Karma: I'm talking. If you interrupt again, my whip will do the speaking for me. Phoenix: (Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...) Yeow!! von Karma: Make no mistake; I will defeat you! Prepare to go down, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Judge: Prosecutor von Karma, your opening statement, please... von Karma: Those of Von Karma blood have only one fate. And that is \"perfection\". The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch. Judge: V-Very well... What is the defense's position? Phoenix: Your Honor. Judge: Does the defense wish to enter a plea of \"not guilty\"? Phoenix: ...Yes. von Karma: Foolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the \"justified self-defense\" plea in no time. Phoenix: (\"Justified self-defense\"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of themself. (Changed from [A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself.] in the original release) We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of \"not guilty\", Your Honor! (Because to plead \"justified self-defense\" is to say you did kill someone.) von Karma: How foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness. Phoenix: (She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.) von Karma: Witness, your name and occupation? Gumshoe: Yes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!! von Karma: Get to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder. Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room. Judge: What were they doing in there? Gumshoe: Um... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir. Judge: Ch-Channeling a spirit?? Phoenix: (That's quite the look of disbelief there, Your Honor...) (Changed from [The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...] in the original release) Gumshoe: *ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room. Judge: Ah, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over. Floor Plans added to the Court Record. Judge: So, how was the victim killed? Gumshoe: I was about to get to that... von Karma: Stop wasting my time, then. Witness Testimony -- Cause of Death -- Gumshoe: The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir. The shot was fired from point-blank range. But before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest. The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death. The murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing. Judge: Hmm... So the victim was stabbed before being shot... Gumshoe: This is the victim's autopsy report, sir. Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: The court accepts it into evidence. Mr. Wright, you may question the witness. Cross Examination -- Cause of Death -- Gumshoe: The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The murder weapon, Detective Gumshoe. Whose pistol was it? Gumshoe: It was the victim's. Phoenix: The victim? Now, why would he have... von Karma: von Karma: \"Why would he have a pistol?\" Who cares? The point that you are missing is whose fingerprints are on that pistol. If you're not already paying attention to that, then I suggest you start. Judge: Fingerprints? There were fingerprints? Gumshoe: Along with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir. Judge: Hmm. So the defendant's fingerprints were left on the murder weapon... Phoenix: (Argh...! I walked right into her hands there.) (Changed from [Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.] in the original release) Gumshoe: The shot was fired from point-blank range. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Point blank, huh? So about how far away was it? Gumshoe: It was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away. Phoenix: And how do you know he was shot at point blank? von Karma: Tsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I grow tired of the foolish foolery of the foolish fools of this foolish country... Phoenix: E-Excuse me!? von Karma: Gunpowder burn. Phoenix: ...Gunpowder burn? von Karma: When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole. Gumshoe: Gunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead! Phoenix: (Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...) Gumshoe: But before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Stabbed... And what was he stabbed with? Gumshoe: A fruit knife. Judge: I see. And whose knife was it? Gumshoe: It looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it. Judge: Hmm... All over it, huh? Phoenix: (Urk. This does not look good...) von Karma: Ha ha ha. What will you do now, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Gumshoe: The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How severe was the wound? Gumshoe: If it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand. Phoenix: (This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...) Gumshoe: The murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure he was stabbed first, then shot? Gumshoe: Yup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal. von Karma: A fool is a fool who will only listen to the foolish opinions of other foolish fools... A pistol shot to the forehead at point blank is certainly enough to kill instantly. Does it matter, then, which was first? Think a little more before you open that big mouth of yours, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Grr... What a pain...) Phoenix: (Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...) After pressing first, second, third, and fifth statements: Judge: That's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered. Gumshoe: I brought the two murder weapons with me today. Judge: Very well. The court accepts them into evidence. Pistol added to the Court Record. Knife added to the Court Record. von Karma: The date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time. Judge: And two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them, huh... (Changed from [And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...?] in the original release) Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case. von Karma: Naturally! Phoenix: (This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...) von Karma: Your Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there? Judge: That is quite true... Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Judge: Even in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead \"not guilty\"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose. von Karma: See, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes... Judge: What will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to \"justified self-defense\"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance. Phoenix: (This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!) Plead justified self-defense Phoenix: (If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to \"justified self-defense\"... von Karma: Hah. Judge: Understood. Let the record show that the defense has entered a new plea. Phoenix: (...There's nothing else I could do... Mia...?) Mia: ...You already hold the key... ...If you don't believe, you cannot win... Phoenix: (...! If we plead \"justified self-defense\", we would basically be confessing to murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'll be labeled a murderer... Can I really... Can I really let that happen!?) Your Honor! Judge: Y-Yes? Phoenix: The defense... The defense retracts its previous statement. And instead, will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant is not guilty! Leads to: \"...You.\" Plead not guilty Phoenix: (If we plead \"justified self-defense\"... we would basically be confessing to a murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'd be labeled a murderer... I can't let that happen!) Your Honor! Judge: Have you reached a conclusion, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The defense will not change its plea. We will accept nothing short of complete acquittal! Leads to: \"...You.\" von Karma: ...You. You have sealed your fate, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Detective! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! von Karma: Present the final portion of your testimony -- the final strike. Gumshoe: Um... Y-Yes... sir... Judge: N-Now, see here! Proceedings are run by... Eek! von Karma: ... Judge: Oh, yes, of course. Go ahead Detective and give your testimony... von Karma: I think the court would like to hear about the other piece of incriminating evidence! Witness Testimony -- Incriminating Evidence -- Gumshoe: Sorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence. This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime. As you can see, it's covered in blood. The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back. Judge: So this is the costume... There certainly is evidence of a back spray of blood on this. Gumshoe: This piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir. Judge: I see... The court accepts this into evidence. Maya's Costume added to the Court Record. Judge: Alright, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??) von Karma: Hah. What's wrong? You seem to be at a loss. I think this is the last piece of testimony the prosecution should have to offer. Feel free to sulk off with your tail between your legs, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Please stop calling me by my full name. It's disturbing.) Cross Examination -- Incriminating Evidence -- Gumshoe: Sorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why didn't you say so in your testimony earlier!? Gumshoe: Uh... You're kinda scary today, you know, pal? Judge: Come now, Mr. Wright... There is no need for that kind of attitude in my court... Phoenix: ... Judge: A-Alright. Just, please stop glaring at me like that... Gumshoe: This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Maya's... costume? Gumshoe: Yeah. She was wearing this when we arrested her. Phoenix: (Maya... She's wearing her channeling costume today too... Is she not allowed to wear anything else...?) Gumshoe: As you can see, it's covered in blood. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: This blood on the costume... Gumshoe: Lab results show that it is the victim's blood. Judge: Hmm... So there is blood from the victim on the defendant's clothes. Phoenix: (Definitely not good...) (Changed from [Definitely not good... Urk.] in the original release) So, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence? (Changed from [Hmm, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Um, well... von Karma: von Karma: If you must change the topic, then the good detective here must testify again. But too bad. Not enough time. Let's move on. (Changed from [But too bad. Not enough time. Time to move on.] in the original release) Judge: Ah, yes, Ms. von Karma is perfectly correct... Phoenix: (Grr... Now even the Judge is on her side! But if I bite off more than I can chew here... What should I do!?) Press further Phoenix: (Why is Ms. von Karma suddenly putting up resistance? There must be a reason as to why she suddenly threw out an objection like that... There must be something about this costume...! (Changed from [There must be a clue somewhere on this costume!] in the original release) I just have to look harder!) Judge: Mr. Wright. Ms. von Karma's logic is perfect. There is no way for you to poke a hole in it. Phoenix: (Argh! Looks like my time is up. So, about the costume...) There is nothing wrong. Phoenix: (If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this. Judge: Good. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination There is one little thing... Phoenix: Your Honor. Actually, there is something very wrong with this piece of evidence. Judge: Wh-What!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about, pal!? von Karma: ... Judge: Wh-Where is this problem you are talking about!? Phoenix: (I've come this far... There's no turning back now!) The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here! Present bullet hole on left sleeve Phoenix: Leads to: \"I ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume.\" Present blood splatter Phoenix: Phoenix: The problem is obviously the blood splatter here! Judge: B-But... We've determined that the blood splatter is from the victim. Where is the problem in that? Gumshoe: Yeah, where, pal? Phoenix: Yeah... I wonder about that too... Judge: That last antic of yours just pushed me over the top, Mr. Wright. I hereby declare this cross-examination over... (Changed from [I am declaring that this cross-examination period is over...] in the original release) Phoenix: P-Please wait, Your Honor! (Ack! I'd better not mess up again...) Leads back to: \"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: There is a problem... somewhere around... here! Judge: Wh-What does he mean, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: There's nothing wrong with it. The only thing wrong here is the defense's head. Judge: Well said. You certainly do take after your father! Phoenix: (I've just been made to look like a fool again... Alright... Focus, Phoenix!) Leads back to: \"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\" Phoenix: I ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume. Judge: The sleeve? ...! There is a tiny hole here... Gumshoe: ..A... A hole...? But that wasn't in the report. Judge: Hold on! What's this around the hole? I-It smells faintly of gunpowder! Gumshoe: G-Gunpowder!? No one ever told me! Judge: A hole that smells of gunpowder... Phoenix: (It looks like I've found the \"hole\" I was looking for!) Your Honor, the only logical conclusion you can make is that it must be a bullet hole! Judge: Order! Order! Order!! This is a very grave matter. It's best we correct the Court Record first before anything else. Maya's Costume updated in the Court Record. Gumshoe: Sorry about that. I guess we messed up, sir. von Karma: ... Phoenix: ...! (I-Is she actually... smiling!? What else is she hiding!?) von Karma: Pull yourself together, Detective. That tiny \"hole\" doesn't change a thing. The strength of the evidence still holds. Continue with your testimony. That, just now, was a fluke. Nothing more. Phoenix: Phoenix: H-How can you say something like that!? This is a huge oversight! Judge: While I agree it is a mistake on the part of the police, what Prosecutor von Karma has said is true. The evidence still stands. If you do not find a more definitive problem with the evidence, then... Phoenix: No way!! Judge: Detective Gumshoe, please continue with your testimony. Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir. Leads back to cross-examination Let it go Phoenix: (If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this. Judge: Good. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Alright. I'll give you that the blood spatter is from the victim, but... what is this hole in the sleeve? Gumshoe: Um... Sorry, pal. We must've thought it was just a tear in the seam... Phoenix: Missing the hole is not what I'm asking you about. I'm talking about the hole itself! The smell of gunpowder  clearly gives away that... it is a bullet hole! von Karma: von Karma: As if little things like that matter. Phoenix: But they do. von Karma: A \"bullet hole\" in the sleeve, blood splatter all over the costume... Neither of these things can change the fact the defendant killed the victim. Phoenix: (...Grr... I know there's something more to that costume.) von Karma: Come now Detective. You're wasting precious time. Gumshoe: ... Yes, sir. Gumshoe: The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He wasn't \"fighting back\"? How do you know if he was or wasn't!? Gumshoe: We could find no evidence that the victim put up any sort of struggle, pal. Judge: Hmm... So did the murderer have a fight with the victim, or not? Depending on this, the circumstances around this murder change drastically. Phoenix: (Ugh... We're in real trouble now... If only I had something to prove that the victim did fight back...) Present Maya's Costume (after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Dick Gumshoe!\" Phoenix: (That Von Karma! She thinks she can decide the verdict with this testimony alone! I have to somehow find a critical contradiction and then I'll have her!) Phoenix: Detective Dick Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Y-Yes? Heh, having you call me by my full name is kind of a weird feeling... Phoenix: You said that my client killed \"a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.\" Gumshoe: Yeah, I did. Phoenix: Then what, may I ask, is the bullet hole you police overlooked supposed to mean!? Gumshoe: Eh, um... What does it mean? Phoenix: I'll tell you what it means. It means that the victim had fired off a shot. Is this what it means to \"not fight back\"? Gumshoe: A-Ah! You're right! Judge: It seems you are correct! (Changed from [It would seem that way!] in the original release) If the victim had tried to shoot the defendant, then... it would change everything... (Changed from [If the victim tried to shoot the defendant, then... It would change everything...] in the original release) Phoenix: (Alright! The wind seems to be shifting...) von Karma: Hah. Phoenix: (What is with that \"are you finished yet\" laugh?) von Karma: Are you finished yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Judge: Ms. von Karma? von Karma: It seems... that Maya Fey was shot at by the victim. However, that is only grounds enough to support a \"justified self-defense\" plea. Judge: That is correct. von Karma: But I'm sure you remember, Your Honor, what the defense clearly said. They rejected \"justified self-defense\" and pleaded \"not guilty.\" Phoenix: Ack! Gumshoe: Now that you... Judge: Why, that's right! von Karma: Which means! The defense has yet to prove anything at all! Phoenix: Nooooo!! Judge: W-Well... Yes, that's true... von Karma: Furthermore... just the fact that there is a bullet hole in the costume... is not enough to substantiate even a plea of \"justified self-defense\". Judge: Huh? How so? Gumshoe: Aaah! von Karma: Don't just stand there. Hurry up and tell the court what transpired that day. ...With the new information we acquired added in, of course. Gumshoe: Huh? You mean... By myself...? You want me to put together the scenario all by myself? Aah! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Right away, sir! Witness Testimony -- What Transpired -- Gumshoe: During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest. Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir. While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun. The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed. The defendant then picked up on the opening, took the victim's gun, and ended it... Judge: Hmm... This scenario you have put together does make sense... Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (On the surface, it does seem to make sense... (Changed from [Just by listening, it does make sense...] in the original release) However, I won't give up that easily!) Judge: P-Please refrain from glaring at me like that... Now then, your cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- What Transpired -- Gumshoe: During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: There is quite a difference in height between Dr. Grey and the defendant. Add in body strength, and it seems unlikely the defendant could have stabbed the victim! Gumshoe: Now that you mention it... Yeah, I guess... von Karma: von Karma: You think you can get away with such flimsy reasoning? Mr. Phoenix Wright! Maya Fey was in the middle of channeling, was she not? Phoenix: ...? von Karma: When channeling with the Kurain Channeling Technique, the medium physically changes. With the nurse's build, the defendant could have easily been a match for the doctor. Phoenix: (I don't believe it... She even studied up on the Kurain Channeling Technique!) von Karma: Like I said before... I am perfect. Judge: Um... Uh... About what you were talking about... I didn't quite get it... Phoenix: ... von Karma: ... Judge: Um, n-never mind. Let's continue with the testimony... Gumshoe: Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So he was stabbed, but the stab wound didn't kill him. Gumshoe: But if you think about the blood loss, it was pretty bad. Phoenix: How bad would you say it was? Gumshoe: Actually, I went to give blood the other day. And afterward, I felt a little lightheaded and dizzy. ...I guess the damage was maybe... about 10 times the dizziness...? Ack! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: S-Sorry! Gumshoe: While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where in the world did that pistol come from? Gumshoe: It looks like the victim, Dr. Grey had specifically bought it for that day. Phoenix: But a handgun...? Gumshoe: He got it off the black market about 2 days before the murder. Phoenix: (Why did Dr. Grey bring a gun...? Was he taking precautions against something...?) Gumshoe: The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you're saying that the bullet hole in this costume was made then? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal, but that's what I'd think. The two of them were already fighting when a shot was fired. Phoenix: (Maya... I'm really glad you weren't hurt...) von Karma: ... Present Maya's Costume Phoenix: Leads to: \"Missing the tiny hole on this costume...\" Gumshoe: The defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun, and ended it... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Maya has never fired a gun before in her life! Gumshoe: The victim had already taken off the safety. With the safety off, even an amateur like you can fire it by pulling the trigger. Phoenix: (Even me...? I wonder...?) von Karma: Now do you understand? A Von Karma's logic is perfect. Phoenix: (His testimony certainly makes us look very bad, but there's gotta be a contradiction in there somewhere... And uncovering it is going to uncover the truth! I can feel it!) Phoenix: Missing the tiny hole on this costume... will be the prosecution's undoing. Gumshoe: Eh? What do you mean? Phoenix: This little hole has actually created a huge hole in your testimony! Judge: E-Explain yourself, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: You said the two of them were fighting when the victim fired his gun at point blank. If that were true, then where is the gunpowder burn on this costume!? Gumshoe: G-Gunpowder... burn? Phoenix: This is what you testified earlier: \"When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\" Gumshoe: OH! Phoenix: But there is not a single trace of gunpowder burn on this costume!! Judge: That is a very good point. And... what exactly does this mean? Phoenix: It means that when the shot was fired, they were standing apart from each other. Judge: Hmm... von Karma: von Karma: I'm disappointed, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You think you can punch a hole in my logic with that? With wishy-washy thinking like that, anyone can explain anything away! Phoenix: Then I implore you to disprove my line of thinking. von Karma: Let's see... In the middle of their fight, the victim pushed the defendant away. And it was then, when they were separated, that he fired! How was that? Phoenix: Phoenix: As if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that! von Karma: ...! W-Well... Then... That's right! The defendant must have pushed the victim away! After stabbing him, she must have put some space between the doctor and herself. And then while she was preparing to strike again, the doctor took his shot. There. That sound satisfy even you. Judge: Hmm... That does make an awful lot of sense. What do you think, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (I must be careful. I can't afford to make a mistake here! Concentrate and think!) It makes sense. Phoenix: (Ack, it's no good. I can't find a \"hole\" in her logic at all this time...) I admit it. Somehow, your reasoning makes logical sense. von Karma: That's it. That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Drat. It's 11:00 AM. I've already missed my morning tea. ...However. At least we were able to arrive at a conclusion. Judge: Hmm... It does look that way. Phoenix: (...Oh boy... If I don't do something soon, it'll be curtains for Maya...) Judge: Well then, I think we can... Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! Please... Wait! Judge: Who was that? Mr. Wright? Please refrain from making unnecessary outbursts! Phoenix: (I don't care how, but I must find something to go on in Von Karma's explanation!) Leads to: \"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\" Something doesn't make sense. Leads to: \"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\" Phoenix: There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor! Gumshoe: Fatal...? Judge: Flaw...!? Yeow! von Karma: Very interesting. I would love to see where this \"flaw\" is! Show me something that contradicts my explanation! Phoenix: (There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere! \"She put some distance between them before rushing to make the final blow. And when she was about to strike, the doctor took his shot.\" There must be a piece of evidence that contradicts this line of thinking!) Present Folding Screen Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Take a look at this! Gumshoe: Why are you showing this to me, pal? Phoenix: Prosecutor von Karma's explanation and this piece of evidence... Gumshoe: ...Do not contradict! Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: Haha, looks like you need to use your brain a little more, pal. Phoenix: (Ugh... Being lectured by Gumshoe, of all people, is so embarrassing...) Gumshoe: Come on! Hurry up and get that thinking cap on! Leads back to: \"There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere!\" Phoenix: This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic. Judge: What is that? A folding screen? Phoenix: I would like to point the court's attention to the \"hole\" in this folding screen. von Karma: Aaah! Phoenix: It looks like you already know what I'm talking about. Gumshoe: Who? Where? What? Judge: Mr. Wright! Your explanation, please! Phoenix: (Are these two really that clueless...?) The bullet went through the defendant's sleeve first, then the folding screen. It passed through at a height of approximately 8 inches off the ground... Which means! When the shot was fired, Maya... I mean, the defendant, was not getting ready to strike, but was actually squatting low to the ground! Judge: Order! Order! Th-This changes everything! Phoenix: Please look at this diagram of the crime scene. The victim, Dr. Grey was here when he fired the shot. And the bullet hit this folding screen. It hit at this location, about 8 inches off the ground. At this time, the defendant was in this area. Present area directly in front of bullet hole Phoenix: Leads to: \"She was standing here, near the folding screen!\" Present area behind folding screen Phoenix: Phoenix: Here! Judge: Behind the folding screen...? Phoenix: Ack! von Karma: The victim and his attacker were fighting, were they not? Then what would the attacker be doing all the way back there!? Phoenix: Um... von Karma: Besides which, if the attacker was behind the folding screen, then how could the victim even know where to shoot? It's obviously impossible! Phoenix: ... Yeah, I guess so... Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Boy, did I just screw up royally... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.) Leads back to: \"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: Somewhere around here! Judge: ...? Phoenix: (Uh oh. The judge's face is scrunched like he just smelled some serious bad breath...) Uhh... Um... That is, I mean... Judge: Wait! I just realized I forgot to brush this morning... Excuse me while I freshen up. Phoenix: Uh, sure... Judge: In the meantime, I want you to think things through again, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Ah, of course... Whoops... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.) Leads back to: \"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\" Phoenix: She was standing here, near the folding screen! von Karma: W-Wait a second! We know the defendant was close to the ground based on the height of the bullet hole. But... How can you gauge the distance from that!? Isn't it possible that the defendant was standing much closer to the victim? Phoenix: That's impossible. von Karma: B-But why!? Phoenix: You, of all people, should know the answer to that question, Ms. von Karma. If she were shot from somewhere closer, there would be gunpowder burns present. However! There is nothing of the sort around the bullet hole of this costume! von Karma: Aaaaaah! C-Curse you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You...! Judge: Hmm... I believe it has now been proven that the defendant was standing a ways from the victim when she was shot at. But do you think this has changed the defendant's situation...? It doesn't change anything. Phoenix: (Hmm, even with that explanation, it feels like nothing has changed... But I can't give up just yet!) Leads to: \"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\" It changes everything. Leads to: \"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\" Phoenix: Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything! The prosecution has claimed that the defendant was aiming to kill by stabbing. If that were true, delivering the final strike with the knife would be ideal. However! Where and what was the defendant doing at the time...? Gumshoe: ...Squatting all the way by the folding screen...? Phoenix: Exactly. If Maya Fey was the real murderer, why would she be by the folding screen instead of preparing to strike? von Karma: Nnngh... Judge: Upon further consideration, it does make very little sense. Gumshoe: Yeah, I figured there had to be a reason. Phoenix: Figuring things out and proving the logic behind everything is YOUR job! Gumshoe: Oof... Phoenix: (Alright! With this, the rest of the trial should be in the b--) von Karma: ... Phoenix: (...blast radius of disaster.) von Karma: You are such a smart man, Mr. Phoenix Wright. To think that you've been able to take a completely hopeless case to this point... Now I know why Papa had a tough time with you. Mmm, you amuse me... Phoenix: (Uuugh. Of all the things to inherit, why did it have to be that smarmy smile!?) von Karma: Detective. How dare you damage my perfect logic!? Gumshoe: H-Huh!?... How is it all my fault?? von Karma: You can start repairing your standing by first removing that three-strand \"goatee\". Oh, and rest assured your punishment will come later. Gumshoe: ...P-Punishment... von Karma: Well then, Your Honor, I think I've had all I can take of this detective's face. I think it's time to call in the next witness. Phoenix: (Next witness...? That's gotta be Lotta!) Judge: Very well. The court will take a 5 minute recess. After we reconvene, we will hear from the next witness. To be continued. June 21, 11:37 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Phoenix: Phew, that was a close one. Maya: I know you were giving it your all to defend me. But I could feel the death penalty hanging in the air... Phoenix: I felt like I was pretty close to dying myself... Pearl: But you were wonderful out there. You listened carefully, made theories, and tricked everyone into believing you. Phoenix: Th-Thanks. Wait... Tricked?? Pearl: That must be the \"lawyer's\" secret technique, right? Maya: By the way... Is the next witness who I think it is...? Phoenix: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's Lotta Hart. Maya: Oh... Guess there's no escaping her, huh? (Changed from [Oh... Another jam, like always...] in the original release) Remember, Nick! You promised you'd save me! If you lose, me and my sis's ghosts will come after you and haunt you! (Changed from [If you lose, my ghost will come after you with my sis', and we'll haunt you!] in the original release) Pearl: Your sister...? Um, are you talking about Mystic Mia? Maya: Yeah. Do you remember her, Pearly? My sister was a super good lawyer! She was also Nick's teacher. Pearl: ...Oh, I didn't know that... June 21, 11:43 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2 Judge: Court will now reconvene. Now, the first order of... Oww! von Karma: I don't want to hear it, old man. After I call my witness, sit there quietly and watch like a good little boy. Judge: Y-Yes, sir. von Karma: Bring in the photographer who witnessed the channeling! von Karma: Witness. Your name and occupation, if you please. Lotta: Hey, Phoenix! How ya doin'? Phoenix: Just fine... Lotta: Sorry 'bout this. Didn't exactly have a choice, ya know...? Yeowza! von Karma: Name and occupation. Lotta: I-I declare! What in tarnation!? Hey, Judge! This here is violence against my fair self! Judge: That's fine. Lotta: \"That's fine!?\" That ain't fine!! That's a whip! Eaaah! von Karma: There's no need for foolish outcries from foolishly foolish fools. Just hurry up and testify about what happened on the day of the murder. Lotta: I haven't even gotten to say my name and job yet... von Karma: ... Lotta: The name's Lotta Hart, paranormal photographer, and I'm here to testify! Judge: Now, now, let's all be one big happy family... OK...? Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- Lotta: Only the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber. We were waitin' outside the door and then, \"bang!\" we hear this gunshot! Mr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room. Inside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around. I swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room. Judge: And did you take a picture of the scene right after the murder took place? Lotta: Reckon course! Phoenix: Eh? ...Excuse me? Lotta: Reckon course! It's short for \"Ya reckon!? Of course I did!\" Aah! von Karma: Does it look like I care? Just hurry up and show your picture to the court. Phoenix: (The moment of truth. What will be in that picture?) Lotta: Umm, let's see here... This here's the picture! Judge: Hmm... It would certainly seem that only the defendant and the victim were in that room. Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: Are you ready, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (I will clear all doubt about Maya through this cross-examination... Just watch me!) Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- Lotta: Only the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was it really only those two that went in!? von Karma: von Karma: What are you blabbering about!? You were there too, were you not!? Phoenix: Urk. von Karma: Why don't you answer that yourself? Was it really just the two of them? Phoenix: ...Yes. Dr. Grey and Maya were the only two who went into the room... Judge: H-Hold on! We can't have the defense testifying against its own client! Lotta: Anyway, folks, only the two of 'em went into the Channelin' Chamber, ya hear? von Karma: But you knew that from the very beginning, didn't you? ...Witness, continue. Lotta: We were waitin' outside the door and then, \"bang!\" we hear this gunshot! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was it really a gunshot!? von Karma: von Karma: Are you insane!? You must have heard it as well! Phoenix: Urk. von Karma: Why don't you testify for the court, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Was it really a gunshot? Phoenix: ...Yes. I think it was something that sounded like a gunshot... Judge: And why are we here listening to the defense testify!? Phoenix: (...And the world becomes just a little crueler...) Lotta: I heard a gunshot a long time ago, so I know. And I tell ya that was a gunshot I heard. Now, this -- this is where the story heats up! Lotta: Mr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, let me get this straight! This \"Mr. Lawyer there\" broke the door down!? von Karma: Honestly, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Why don't you tell us what happened, then? Phoenix: Um... Yes, Ms. von Karma... I broke the door down. Sorry. (Why does this feel like an inquisition?) Lotta: No need for apologizin'! That was great! You're a real man! Judge: Oh, really? That's something I would've liked to see. Phoenix: (The judge is smiling rather openly. I'll take that as a good sign...) von Karma: And? What did you see once you broke in? Lotta: Inside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure it was the defendant, Maya Fey!? Lotta: Sure, I'm sure! Phoenix: (Lotta seems awful confident in her testimony...) Press harder Phoenix: Lotta! Please, think back to that day one more time. Lotta: Wh-Whatcha getting' at? Phoenix: Remember what you said when we broke into the room...? ???: ...I was... murdered... *klik* Phoenix: Lotta! At a time like this!? Lotta: Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!? Phoenix: When you saw the murderer at that time, you couldn't even tell if it was Maya Fey or not! Am I correct!? Lotta: Ah, um, well, ya see... Judge: Order! Ms. Hart! You are here to present accurate testimony! Lotta: Yeah, ah, s-sorry. Phoenix: (Good. This shifts things back to my side...) von Karma: For a defense lawyer, your defense is terribly lacking, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: ! von Karma: Witness. Think back to when those two entered the Channeling Chamber. Lotta: When they entered...? von Karma: One of those people that entered the chamber was Maya Fey, correct? Lotta: Yeah, that's right! Phoenix: (Yeah... It was Maya that went in.) Judge: Hmm... It looks like we've come to a collective conclusion. The person in this picture is most certainly Maya Fey. von Karma: Exactly. Phoenix: (Rats! And I'm trapped like one... Again!) Leads back to cross-examination Leave her be Phoenix: (Even I can see that any normal person would know who that was. It's no good. I shouldn't push my luck on this...) Leads back to cross-examination Lotta: I swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain of that!? Lotta: Sure am! But that old witch chased us out of the room, so... Phoenix: (\"Old witch\"? Does she mean Morgan Fey?) Lotta: But there was no one else in there, and you know it! Phoenix: (The Channeling Chamber was very dark, almost pitch black... Was there really no one else in there? What about...?) behind the folding screen? Phoenix: What about... behind the folding screen? Did you check back there? Lotta: Reckgiven! Phoenix: Huh? What in the...? Lotta: Reckgiven! Ya know! \"Ya reckon!? That's a given!\" I took me a good look around the room once! There ain't no way anyone was hangin' out behind that foldin' screen! Judge: Hmm... If I may have a word with you, Ms. Hart... Lotta: Wh-What? Ya got a problem!? Judge: Reckgiven!... I mean, I am having a little difficulty in understanding you. If you would stop saying such things as \"Reckongiven\" and so forth... Aah! von Karma: Now then, Mr. Phoenix Wright, do you see a problem with the testimony or don't you? Leads back to cross-examination behind the door? Phoenix: What about... behind the door? Did you check there? Lotta: What do I look like to you? I wasn't born yesterday, ya know! First off, the one that bust that door open was you! With the way ya slammed that door, anyone standin' behind it woulda had more face and less nose, free of charge! von Karma: In any case, there was no one standing behind the door. Phoenix: (She actually had the police investigate that too!?) Leads back to cross-examination under the flooring? Phoenix: What about... under the flooring? Did you check there? Lotta: I ain't no ignoramus to make it out here! Phoenix: Huh?... Wh-What are you talking about? Lotta: Don't \"what are ya talkin' about\" me! Under the floorin'? C'mon!, even a bug wouldn't crawl under that! von Karma: Sorry to disappoint, but there was no secret passageway under the flooring. Phoenix: (Oh... Yeah, that was a bit far-fetched, huh...?) Leads back to cross-examination Phoenix: (Argh! Her story adds up... What's worse, I was there at the scene of the crime with her... (Changed from [What's worse is that I was there at the scene of the crime at that time too,] in the original release) and her story is exactly how I would have told it, too... (Changed from [and her story is exactly how I would have told it...] in the original release)) After pressing all statements: Phoenix: (Argh! Just as I thought, there is nothing wrong with her testimony! I was with her, so I know she's telling the truth...) Judge: Enough. It seems that there are no issues with Ms. Hart's testimony. von Karma: At the time of the crime, only two people were in the Channeling Chamber: the victim, Dr. Turner Grey, and the defendant, Maya Fey. Judge: Hmm... The face of the defendant can not be verified in this picture. However, if we think about the circumstances, it would have to be the defendant. Phoenix: (What am I going to do!? If I just let this go...) Judge: What is it, Mr. Wright? You look as if you have something to say... Phoenix: (If I make one wrong move, I'm going to have the judge against me... Is there anything I can present that would prove it's not Maya in that photo?) Present evidence Phoenix: Your Honor! Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: It is possible that the person in this photo is not the defendant! Judge: Wh-Wh-What!? Do you know what you are proposing!? Lotta: Y-Y-Yeah! That's just plain fool's talk! Phoenix: (Thanks guys. Your show of support was just great...) von Karma: ... Judge: ...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof. Prove to this court that the person in this photo is not Maya Fey! Present anything Phoenix: Phoenix: Here is your proof! von Karma: von Karma: ... Phoenix: Is there a problem? von Karma: Oh, no. I thought I would work on my inflections. Just wondering what an \"Objection!\" with a twist of \"You're wrong!\" sounds like. Judge: Mr. Wright. I'm sorry, but I don't follow your logic. Phoenix: (Shoot. I guess I wasn't showing enough confidence...) Present another piece Leads back to: \"...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof.\" Give up Leads to: \"Well, Mr. Wright?\" Can't present anything yet Leads to: \"Well, Mr. Wright?\" Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Nothing, Your Honor... von Karma: That's very smart of you, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You really should give up trying to prove this is not Maya Fey. Phoenix: (I didn't say anything about giving up! I just don't have the right piece of evidence to prove my argument...) Judge: That's enough! Phoenix: (I-Is this it...? Is this all I could do...?) Judge: I think it is quite obvious to this court that a verdict of not guilty is not possible. von Karma: I told you. Totally, 100% impossible. Judge: Ms. von Karma, do you have any further questions for this witness? von Karma: Having established the defendant's guilt, further questioning won't be needed. Judge: What about the defense? No further questions, I presume? Phoenix: (I... I couldn't protect Maya...) The defense... The defense... ...Phoenix... ...Phoenix, you can't make that kind of face... ...A lawyer is someone who smiles... no matter how bad it gets!... Phoenix: M-Mia! Mia: I guess I made it just in time, wouldn't you say? Phoenix: Y-You... But... P-Pearls! Mia: Her clothes ARE a bit small... Anyway, what are you waiting for, Phoenix!? Let's go! Phoenix: B-But how!? She's already taken away every advantage! Mia: The advantage is still in your hand! Think carefully, one more time, about what you saw in the Channeling Chamber. Do you remember what you told me yesterday? Phoenix: D-Dr. Grey!! *klik* ???: ...I was... murdered... Phoenix: W-What!? *klik* Phoenix: Lotta! At a time like this!? Lotta: Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! Mia: You see... There is one final piece to this puzzle. (Changed from [You see... There is one final piece of the puzzle.] in the original release) Phoenix: Mia...? Mia: Question Lotta one more time, Phoenix. I don't know if she's doing it unconsciously or on purpose, but... (Changed from [I don't know if she's doing it subconsciously or on purpose, but...] in the original release) she's not testifying truthfully. Judge: Now then, this court would like to end the cross-examination period. Phoenix: Phoenix: Please wait, Your Honor! The defense would like to request that the witness testify one more time. Judge: Overruled. I'm afraid you're too late, Mr. Wright. The cross-examination has already ended. Furthermore, any unrelated ques- Aah! von Karma: It's fine. I'll allow another testimony. A Von Karma's case is perfect. Absolutely flawless. And what better time than this for you to see that. Judge: B-But... I mean... I have some place I must go after this... Mmph! A-Al-Alright! I'll allow it! Ms. Hart! Hurry and give us another testimony! Lotta: Well... heck... What am I supposed to talk about? Phoenix: Please tell us once more, what happened when you burst into the Channeling Chamber. Lotta: OK! You got it! Mia: See, you got through to the judge somehow, right? Phoenix: (Well, actually it was Von Karma's whip that got through to him...) Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account, Pt. 2 -- Lotta: When we broke into that room, all I could focus on was Maya. I was... uh, kinda scared of the dead body, so I didn't take a good look at it. I'm really bad when it comes to blood and ghosts and stuff. But I still managed to point my camera at Maya and take a shot! Judge: Nothing sounds different from before... Phoenix: (Some parts of her testimony were very vague. I should press her on those sections!) von Karma: Struggle all you like as you taste the bitterness of your defeat. Well, amuse me with your useless questions, Mr. Phoenix Wright. I'm waiting... Cross Examination -- Witness' Account, Pt.2 -- Lotta: When we broke into that room, all I could focus on was Maya. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, what did she look like? Lotta: Ya know, she looked almost like a different person. Judge: A... A different person? von Karma: She may have seemed like a different person, however, she was still Maya Fey. We have already made that point abundantly clear! Judge: Yes, that is true... Well, then, Ms. Hart. Did you happen to see anything else? Lotta: I was... uh, kinda scared of the dead body, so I didn't take a good look at it. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Then perhaps that body was not Dr. Grey's at all! Lotta: Eh!? W-Well... I reckon that's possible... von Karma: von Karma: If the body inside that room was not that of Dr. Grey, then whose body was it, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: Well, what if it was that of Maya Fey after the channeling? Or maybe -- Oww! von Karma: Foolish fool spouting foolish foolishness, just as I expect of a foolish fool such as you. If that were the case, then that would mean that Maya Fey is, in fact, dead. And that would make the defendant's chair quite a lonely place, wouldn't it!? Phoenix: (Urk... Sorry, Maya...) Lotta: Are y'all done here? Can I continue? Lotta: I'm really bad when it comes to blood and ghosts and stuff. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And even knowing that, you still persist in being a paranormal photographer? Lotta: That's why I'm getting out of this here business. This gal's gonna get the dirt on the stars and be a tabloid photographer from now on! Phoenix: (She goes through jobs faster than a baby through diapers.) Wah! von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright. Would it kill you to stay on topic for a change? Judge: Well? Would it, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (Nice, tag-teamed in stereo. Guess I should be grateful it's not in 5.1...) Lotta: But I still managed to point my camera at Maya and take a shot! Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"Two, right?\" Mia: There must be something we can use in her testimony just now. We must find it! At all costs... Phoenix: Two, right? Lotta: T-Two what? Phoenix: Two shots. You took two shots. Judge: But... Only one has been submitted as evidence! Phoenix: Ms. Hart! Where is the other picture you have been withholding!? Lotta: No, no, no! You've got it all wrong! It's not me! I-I didn't mean anything bad! I know I can be a little mean, but I ain't evil! Phoenix: (Well, at least she knows herself...) Judge: Then why have you not shown this \"other picture\" to this court yet? Lotta: Well, ain't it obvious!? That prosecutor woman told me to shut my trap about it! Phoenix: W-What!? V... Von Karma!! Judge: M-M-Ms. von Karma! Y-Y-You... You're hiding critical evidence...! von Karma: ... Phoenix: (Unforgivable, von Karma. Suppressing evidence like this... You're as bad as your father!) Confront Franziska Phoenix: Your Honor! The defense asks that Prosecutor von Karma be held in contempt of court! Judge: Hmm... Well, yes... Mngh! von Karma: Me? In contempt of court!? You can't be serious. Phoenix: But... But you hid evidence from the court... On purpose! That's... That's... That's not fair! Mia: P-Phoenix!! Are you a lawyer or a school child? Phoenix: (Ack! I was so angry I lost my composure...) Leads to: \"Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?\" Leave it to the Judge Phoenix: (...Argh! I'm so mad that even my throat's clenching up! I'd better let the Judge handle this...) Leads to: \"Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?\" Judge: Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court? von Karma: I thought this picture was not important, and thus, felt no need to submit it. That's all. Phoenix: H-How could you think...!? von Karma: The pictures were more or less the same, so why bother with the second? I mean, it's just so much more trouble than it's worth for me to submit this as evidence. Phoenix: \"M-More trouble that [sic] it's worth!?\" How... How can you say that!? von Karma: If you want to see it that badly, I'll submit it. Lotta's Photo 2 added to the Court Record. Judge: ... Wh-What is...? What is this picture!? von Karma: It's obviously the second picture the witness took that day at the scene of the crime. Well, it's a little off-center, but that's what you get with a nervous amateur. Judge: Um... I think the important point here is the person in this picture! (Changed from [Well, I think the important point here is the person in this picture!] in the original release) This is most definitely NOT Maya Fey! What is the meaning of this!? Phoenix: (This might be the break I was looking for... Now, should I or should I not insist that the person in this picture is not Maya?) Drop the issue Phoenix: ... (It's no good. We've been through this so many times...) Judge: This is not like you, Mr. Wright! Why are you not objecting!? The person in this photo is clearly not the defendant and yet... von Karma: Ha ha ha... There is no way he can raise an objection and hope to live. Judge: Explain yourself! Leads to: \"Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture.\" Insist it's not Maya Phoenix: Your Honor! As you can plainly see, the person in the picture is not Maya Fey! Judge: Y-Yes, I see that... It's not just her face! Her whole body has taken on a different appearance! Phoenix: There is only one conclusion that can be drawn, then. That somehow, this other person snuck in and traded places with the defendant! Judge: Order! Order! Order!! Well, yes, I believe you are correct, Mr. Wright! The person who was inside the Channeling Chamber was not Maya Fey! Phoenix: Mia! We did it! Mia: ...You're too soft. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: You're softer than Aunt Morgan's strawberry desserts, Phoenix. Take a look at Prosecutor von Karma's face. Phoenix: (S-She's... smiling...!?) von Karma: I think you had better continue to worry, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Judge: M-Ms. von Karma! What do you mean by that? Leads to: \"Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture.\" von Karma: Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture. This was taken yesterday at the Detention Center's Visitor's Room. This is Mr. Phoenix Wright and the defendant, Maya Fey during his visit... Judge: Maya Fey? But... Isn't this a totally different person!? von Karma: She looks this way because she is obviously in the middle of channeling a spirit! Judge: It's unbelievable... That she can... von Karma: Yet, it is the truth. (Changed from [However, it is true.] in the original release) When Maya Fey is in that state, she physically changes into the person she's calling! Judge: ... Mia: Ms. von Karma. A word, if I may. (Changed from [I wonder if she knows what she's doing...] in the original release) Phoenix: (M-Mia!?) (Question mark not present in the original release) Mia: Taking pictures of someone during a private visit is illegal. Surely, you must know that that picture can't be submitted as evidence. (Changed from [That picture can't be submitted as evidence.] in the original release) von Karma: ... Obviously, I know this picture is illegal. (Changed from [Obviously, this picture is illegal.] in the original release) But I never intended to submit it as evidence in the first place! Phoenix: (Wh-What is she...?) von Karma: From the moment I showed this picture to the court, this case became all mine. After all, this image has now been forever burned into the judge's mind. Judge: ... Phoenix: (I... I don't have even a single witty line...) Mia: It looks like we've been had. Judge: I don't claim to understand this, and I still cannot believe it... Are you saying that this person... this person is the defendant, Maya Fey!? Phoenix: (If I give up here, the trial will end! But... If I slip up and say something wrong, it will cost me... Is there any way I can prove that the person in this picture is not Maya!?) I can't prove it. Phoenix: (It's no good! My argument doesn't hold any water!) Judge: I see the defense is staying silent on this one. Phoenix: ...Yes... Your Honor... von Karma: And to think. I even gave you this chance to prove your point for free. But you couldn't even point yourself out in a line-up! Judge: Hmm... Yes... Well, then. I believe we have reached a conclusion. Mia: Phoenix! Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: You can't give up! Please, for me? Take a look at the Court Record again and try to find some way out of this jam! Phoenix: Yeah... Some way... Mia: The judge is about to close the trial. You can't let that happen! Phoenix: (Argh... It's come down to this!) Your Honor! Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now. Judge: What is it, now, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Please! Please let me explain! Leads to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" I can prove it. Phoenix: Your Honor! Judge: Oh! The fire has returned to your eyes, I see. Phoenix: This picture... Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now. Judge: A contradiction!? Leads to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" von Karma: So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep. Why don't you point out exactly what is so strange in this picture for the court? Present bottom of cuff on left sleeve Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please direct your attention here!\" Present face Phoenix: Phoenix: Please direct your attention here! Judge: ...T-To her... face? Phoenix: With your own two eyes, you can clearly see that this face does not belong to Maya Fey! von Karma: von Karma: Fool! Do you even know what you're talking about anymore!? Phoenix: AAAH! THAT HURT! von Karma: Didn't we just finish discussing that her appearance changes during channeling!? Lotta: I know you ain't no dummy, so don't think yer foolin' no one here! Judge: There is a limit to everything, Mr. Wright. And that includes patience! Mia: Phoenix! You have to think before you speak! You can't just blurt out any old thing. Maya: ...Nick! You're supposed to be helping me! Phoenix: (*cringe* Even Maya's mad at me now... I have to focus!) Leads back to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: The contradiction lies... Here! Judge: ...You don't sound very sure of yourself, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Excuse me, but can you really tell me how much confidence I have in this!? von Karma: Hmph! What is with that attitude!? Phoenix: AAAH! THAT HURT! von Karma: Didn't we just finish discussing that her appearance changes during channeling!? Lotta: I know you ain't no dummy, so don't think yer foolin' no one here! Judge: There is a limit to everything, Mr. Wright. And that includes patience! Mia: Phoenix! You have to think before you speak! You can't just blurt out any old thing. Maya: ...Nick! You're supposed to be helping me! Phoenix: (*cringe* Even Maya's mad at me now... I have to focus!) Leads back to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" Phoenix: Please direct your attention here! Judge: ...T-To the sleeve? But... But there isn't anything odd about it... Phoenix: And that is exactly what is so odd. Something that should be there is suddenly missing. von Karma: \"Should be there\"...? Aaaaah! Phoenix: There was a bullet hole in the sleeve of the defendant's costume! If that's the case, then it should be in this picture as well! Judge: Ms. von Karma!! Y-You... You intended to hide this valuable piece of evidence!? von Karma: ... Judge: You will most certainly be assigned a penalty for this! Phoenix: (Alright. This should do some major damage to her argument...) Mia: Don't celebrate yet. Phoenix: You like to bring down the mood, don't you? Mia: Take a look at Ms. von Karma's face. Phoenix: (Argh! She's got that condescending grin plastered all over her face again.) von Karma: ...Tsk, tsk, jumping the gun again, I see. Your Honor! I would like to extend an apology on behalf of those incompetent fools. Judge: Wh-What do you mean? And what \"incompetent fools\"...? von Karma: If those fools down at the precinct hadn't missed the bullet hole, I would have gotten a report about it. As I didn't, I could not have known that this picture was of any value to this case. Judge: Hmm, I see... Phoenix: (She's lying through her teeth! I know it! That woman knew about everything! The bullet hole, the picture -- everything!) Mia: But you can't prove that. Franziska von Karma's idea of a \"perfect case\" is quite fascinating, don't you think? von Karma: Your Honor. You need not worry. If you must assign a penalty, I'll personally make sure that detective gets what's coming. I'm sure there will be a great gnashing of teeth at the next salary discussion. Phoenix: (Poor Gumshoe...) Judge: In any case, this is a very big problem! When the defendant was taken into custody, her costume had a bullet hole in its sleeve. However, from this photo, it would appear that right after the shooting, there was none! von Karma: ... Mia: The judge is confused by this strange twist of events. This is your chance, Phoenix! Load all you've got into this one shot, alright!? Phoenix: Got it! (Watch this, Maya!) Your Honor! There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction! This picture is a fake. Phoenix: The fact that the defendant's costume has a bullet hole in its sleeve is a fact! Which can only mean one thing. That this picture is a fake! Judge: Wh-What!? Lotta: Hey! You callin' me a forger now!? Phoenix: Well, no, not you exactly... Well, not per se... Lotta: Oh no ya don't! Don't you be scratchin' yer head with that goofy smile like some monkey! Now, why do ya think I'd do somethin' that nasty!? C'mon now! Mia: Phoenix! Use your brain for a change! Phoenix: S-Sorry, Chief... Leads back to: \"There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!\" The bullet hole was made later. Phoenix: There is only one explanation for why there is no hole in the sleeve in the picture! The hole was created much later, after the murder took place! Judge: A-After the murder!? Lotta: Hey! Those two gunshots we heard were before we broke in, or did ya forget!? Phoenix: Hmm... I-Is that how it went? von Karma: The pistol fired only two shots. No more, no less. Judge: You do know how to count, right? Mia: Phoenix! What are you doing!? Try it one more time! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Chief... Leads back to: \"There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!\" The shooter is someone else. Leads to: \"The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it.\" Phoenix: The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it. However, this person clearly does not. There can be only one explanation. The person who shot Dr. Grey was not the defendant, but a different person altogether! von Karma: Wha-Whaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! If order is not restored, I will suspend this trial! Oww! Phoenix: Aah! Lotta: Why me!? von Karma: The defense's... The defense's argument is a complete mess! Phoenix: A complete mess? I fail to see how! Please, enlighten us. von Karma: Hey, witness! Lotta: Aah! What the heck!? Is that any way to ask a gal a favor!? von Karma: Be quiet you! You were the one who said it was only the two of them when you entered the room! Lotta: Well, ya know... von Karma: If you were lying, I swear that my whip will be the last thing you see! Lotta: L-Look, sis... You're lookin' mighty scary so why don't we say you... Waah! I-I swear! I wasn't lyin' or nothin'! There wasn't anyone else in there! Honest! von Karma: You see! Now riddle me this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Where did the defendant vanish to!? And where did this other woman appear from!? Phoenix: Umm... (Why is it lately, all I want to do is cry...?) Judge: Well, if the person in this picture is not the defendant, then this poses 2 very big questions. First, where did the defendant vanish to, and second, where did this person come from? von Karma: That's right! Now hurry up and answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Mia: Come on! You can't fall apart here, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (I can't believe that even Mia's calling me by my full name... But... I mean... How am I supposed to prove something like this!?) von Karma: Had enough yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Or do you think you have enough in you to turn things around even now!? Phoenix: (To \"turn things around\"... That's right. Mia would always turn things around and change her perspective!) Mia: Phoenix...? Phoenix: (So, where did this intruder appear from, and where did Maya disappear to? I need to look at this situation from a different angle! Let's see... What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room... And what if Maya had left that room somehow... If I could prove that either one of those conditions were true...) Judge: Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you've come up with. Phoenix: I think what happened before we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber is... a 3rd person had entered it. Phoenix: Your Honor! I would like to present some evidence! I have proof that there was someone else in the room before the murder took place! Present anything Phoenix: Phoenix: Please take a good look at this! Judge: ...Okay... von Karma: I've already seen it. Phoenix: Thank you. Judge: And? What is the purpose of this item? Phoenix: Don't you see, Your Honor? von Karma: I don't think you actually see what you are doing. Phoenix: ... *sigh* Judge: I think it is the court that should be sighing at you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ouch, that stung...) Present another piece Leads back to: \"Your Honor! I would like to present some evidence!\" Think it over again Phoenix: (I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...) Leads back to: \"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\" Maya had left the room. Phoenix: Maya had left the Channeling Chamber at some point! And the defense can prove this! von Karma: Oh, how a foolish fool makes a foolish face while dreaming foolishly foolish dreams. Maya Fey was being looked after by her aunt, Morgan Fey. The chances of her leaving the crime scene is lower than that detective's salary! Judge: Anyway, let's see some evidence. Prove that from the murder until the time of arrest, the defendant had left the room. Present Black Key Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key?\" Present anything else Phoenix: The evidence you're looking for is... this? Judge: ... Lotta: Why the heck is there a \"?\" at the end there for!? Phoenix: Well, actually, I'm not really sure about this evidence, you know...? Judge: Next time, only present evidence you actually do have faith in. Phoenix: (Oww... That burned...) Present another piece Leads back to: \"Anyway, let's see some evidence.\" Think it over again Phoenix: (I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...) Leads back to: \"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\" something I can't explain yet. Phoenix: I'm sorry, but I simply can't. von Karma: Y-You see!? And the reason is quite simple. Because there is no explanation. That's why! Judge: Hmm... As I thought. Another big waste of this court's time. Mia: Phoenix! You can't just give up like that! Phoenix: But Mia! Mia: Rethink things one more time! There has to be an explanation! von Karma: I'm already \"perfect\". So of course, my conclusions are also \"perfect\". Phoenix: (Grr... Alright, Wright. Calm down and let's try this one more time!) Leads back to: \"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\" Phoenix: Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key? Lotta: Um... Well, I've seen it... Hey! That's the Channeling Chamber key, right? Before the channeling started, Maya locked the door from the inside with that... von Karma: The defendant herself locked the door...? Lotta: Yeah! That's why we all couldn't get the door open. That key's the only one of its kind, after all. Judge: Oh... One of a kind, you say? von Karma: ...! Wait... Mr. Phoenix Wright... Phoenix: Yes? (It looks like she's catching on...) von Karma: I'm afraid to ask, but... Why is that key currently in your possession? Judge: Huh? What do you mean? Phoenix: If Maya Fey locked herself in, then the key should have been with her. Judge: Yes, agreed. Phoenix: However, she did not have the key at the time of her arrest! Lotta: Aah! Well, ain't that a kick! So how come you're holdin' it!? Phoenix: I got this as a present from a certain little girl. And that little girl was nowhere near the crime scene at the time! von Karma: Th-Th-That's preposterous! Phoenix: This means that Maya Fey must have left the room! If she had not, then I would not be holding this key you see before you! von Karma: N-Nooooooo! Judge: It seems we have come to an impasse. This picture has clearly captured the face of the murderer. However, is this person the defendant or not? The defense is arguing that this person is not the defendant. Furthermore, as proof, this key has been submitted as evidence. Ms. von Karma. von Karma: How. Can. This. Be!? Judge: At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant's guilt is not possible. (Changed from [At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant is not possible.] in the original release) von Karma: My perfect case! How is there a flaw in my perfect case! Don't think you've won yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright! I am a prodigy! I have never lost a case! And I don't intend to lose here in this courtroom to a fool like you! I don't care what I have to do... I will get my guilty verdict! Judge: That's enough! If you would like to continue, do so in the lobby. Court will reconvene tomorrow at 10 AM. That is all. Court is adjourned. June 21, 1:32 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Maya: Woooow! That was you Pearly!? You summoned my sis!? Pearl: Yes. I felt I had no choice... Maya: Great going, Pearly! I knew you were special! Hey, Nick, did you know? Phoenix: (...Umm, yeah. It's not like anyone else in there could have done that.) Maya: Hmm, Nick... I know you're trying really hard and all, but... I really don't remember ever leaving that room. Pearl: And I don't think that a third person... could have gone into that room. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Well, at least we have until tomorrow to figure things out. Like, what happened in that room, for instance. Maya: Yeah. I'm counting on you! Pearl: Ah... I envy the two of you... Maya: Oh, by the way, Nick. Do you think you could take Pearly back home for me? Phoenix: Sure. Alright, Pearls. You ready to go buy some tickets? Pearl: Huh? A tik-ket? Phoenix: (Poor thing... So sheltered.) To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maya Fey... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!

I had to come and look into a few things here today anyway. Pearl: Um... I thought about this a little. Phoenix: ? Pearl: If Mystic Maya didn't kill that nice man... Phoenix: She definitely didn't! Pearl: Yes, of course. But if she didn't... Then someone else did, right? Um, that \"murderer\" person! Phoenix: Yes, Pearls. Pearl: Oh... I see... Phoenix: (I wonder what's wrong... She seems sad...) Examine Phone booth Phoenix: It's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. I called the police from this phone. Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So, what did you think of seeing your first trial? Pearl: I was really surprised! I had never seen so many people before! Phoenix: O-Oh... Pearl: And Mystic Maya looked so small... and helpless. Phoenix: (Well, Maya's already naturally short, so...) Pearl: And then, that snobby woman with the ruffly clothes... Phoenix: (Ruffly... Oh, she means Franziska...) Pearl: She had such a bad attitude! She acted like she had already decided that Mystic Maya did it... I am going to tell her what I think of her tomorrow! Phoenix: (I wouldn't miss tomorrow's trial for the world...) Prosecutors (appears after \"Today's trial\") Pearl: Why was that woman bullying Mystic Maya? Phoenix: Well, she's the opposite of a lawyer -- a prosecutor, so her job is to prove people guilty. They don't care if someone's innocent. All they care about is if they win. Pearl: Th-That's terrible! B-But... She's really a good prosecutor with a heart on the inside, right? Phoenix: ... There's no one like that. All prosecutors are the same. ... Well, \"he\" might have become a good guy... Eventually... Pearl: \"He\"? Who are you talking about, Mr. Nick? Is it that person Mystic Maya was talking about? Mr. Eh-ji-werth...? Phoenix: ...That was a long time ago. He's not around anymore... Pearl: Huh? Phoenix: He clutched onto his foolish pride too fiercely... and died for it. Pearl: O-Oh... That's too bad... The murderer Phoenix: By the way... Pearl: Yes? What is it? Phoenix: Um, you wouldn't happen to know anything about who the murderer is... would you? Pearl: Wh-Why are you asking me!? Phoenix: No, I was just thinking earlier... Pearl: I didn't see anything! Phoenix: (She \"didn't see anything\", huh...? Speaking of that... During the murder... where was Pearls, and what was she doing...? And on top of that... This key... Just when did she pick this up...?) Pearl's alibi (appears after \"The murderer\") Phoenix: I just realized that I never asked you what you were doing at the time of the crime. Pearl: ...? Phoenix: Pearls, where were you and what were you doing when the murder happened? Pearl: Ah...! Phoenix: ...? Pearl: Wh-What I-I w-was doing? Ah, I-I w-wasn't d-doing a-anything! Phoenix: (She's really bad at lying...) You can whisper it to me. I won't tell anyone else. I promise. 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: Aah! Pearl: ... Um... I guess you can see through my lie, huh? Phoenix: Yeah... Clearly. Pearl: I can't lie to you, can I, Mr. Nick? Pearl's alibi (subsequent times) Phoenix: You really won't tell me what you were doing at the time of the murder...? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I'm sorry... Phoenix: But with the Magatama, I can unlock your Psyche-Locks, right? Pearl: Yes... Ah, what should I do...? Should I tell you what my secret is...? Phoenix: (If you would just tell me, it would be easier for the both of us...) Pearl: I'm so nervous... Phoenix: (Pearls is holding the key to this whole case! I can feel it! ...Speaking of keys, this one turned out to be quite important too... I didn't think it would literally be the \"key\" to today's trial.) Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: So... that's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure? Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: I feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama... Phoenix: (Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...) Folding Screen Pearl: So you like things about spirit channeling too? The Kurain Sacred Writings are on this folding screen. Phoenix: Oh? Is that what's written on it? Pearl: There are six lines to the Sacred Writings. Cleanse thy soul... Open the door to the spiritual realm beyond... Converse with the departed... ... Cast on thyself Protection... Maintain the spell... Release the spell... Phoenix: (So basically, this has nothing to do with the murder... Well, that's super.) Black Key Phoenix: About this key, Pearls... You found it on the day of the murder, right? Pearl: Yes. Phoenix: Now, where you found this key is very important. So, please tell me, Pearls. Where did you find this? Pearl: Um... I found it in the incinerator... Phoenix: The incinerator? (Hmm, is she talking about the one in the garden?) Pearl: The door on it was a little open, so I took a peek... Phoenix: When was that? Pearl: It was after the channeling, when everyone was in a panic. Phoenix: Hmm... Pearl: Um... Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ...? Yes? Pearl: Are you going to tell my mother? Phoenix: Huh? You mean, tell Morgan what you did? Pearl: Yes. If she finds out that I was playing in the left-over trash, I'll get a spanking. Phoenix: ...Ah, gotcha. Well, let's keep it a secret from her then, alright? (Hmm, the incinerator, huh? Sounds like a good place to search next...) Knife Pearl: I've seen this knife before. Phoenix: Really!? Where!? Pearl: M-My kitchen... Phoenix: (Oh... That's right... This knife belongs to the Feys...) Pearl: I'll skin and cut up some apples for you later, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: O-OK... Thanks. Maya's Costume Pearl: Th-That's Mystic Maya's! Phoenix: (Ack!! I shouldn't have shown her something this violent...) Pearl: I-I-Is that... Blood!? Phoenix: Umm... It's nothing. Really. Just forget your ever saw this, okay? (What was I thinking? I can't show stuff like this to a child.) Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Phoenix: (On second thought, showing her this picture might cause severe trauma...) Pearl: ...? Mia Fey profile Pearl: I knew her for a little while. Mystic Mia was your teacher, right? I'm sure she was a great Master of Lawyers. Phoenix: (\"Master of Lawyers\"... I guess...? I mean, it's not exactly a martial art...) Pearl: You should keep training, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're probably right. Pearl Fey profile Pearl: To tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me. Phoenix: I think your hair now suits you perfectly. Pearl: R-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget* Phoenix: *fidget, fidget* Franziska von Karma profile Pearl: Ah! This person! I can't let her get away with bullying Mystic Maya like that! I'm going to cast a curse on her! Phoenix: C-Can spirit mediums really do that...? Pearl: ... Actually, no, I guess not... Grr... I have to find something I can do, then! Phoenix: (When they're mad, the women of the Fey family could give Medusa a run for her money...) June 21Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: This case has had me out of the office most of the time... I can come back tomorrow. Helping Maya should be my top priority now. Examine Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's a handful but I've grown quite attached to the little fella. He also helps me to remember all the good times with Mia. June 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (Maya must still be in questioning... She'll probably be done in a little bit, so I'll come back later...) June 21Fey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: (It's really empty... There's supposed to be training held today, but I guess it's already over...) Examine Door Phoenix: A door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. But I guess it wasn't strong enough to withstand The Phoenix! June 21Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: (...Hmm, looks like Morgan's here too, but she hasn't noticed me yet... What is she doing...? She looks like she's talking to a picture...) Morgan: ...Don't you see? Take a look around... Finally, my chance has come... I've waited for this day for so long! That's right... Prepare yourself, dear Misty... Phoenix: (What in the...!?) Morgan: Who's there!? ...Oh, if it isn't Mr. Wright... Phoenix: Um... Just curious, but that picture you were just looking at... Morgan: Oh, today was that event, was it not, good sir? I heard you did well. Phoenix: Huh, oh, yes... Thank you. Morgan: I am terribly sorry I could not attend the trial today. Please accept my apology. I had a previous engagement, as I had to watch over the trainees' training today. Phoenix: (I get the sense she really doesn't want to talk about the picture...) Morgan: All because the Master can't be here with us, you understand. And that is why a lowly branch family member such as myself must do this. Examine Space behind folding screen Phoenix: There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. There wasn't anyone back here at the time of the murder... Or that's what Lotta testified in court... (I knew I should've taken a look... I can always count on Lotta to make things hard...) Talk What happened Phoenix: Have you remembered anything about the murder? (Changed from [Have you remembered something about the murder?] in the original release) Morgan: No, I told you everything I know already. Phoenix: Were you in this room the whole time when Lotta and I went to call the police? (Changed from [Where [sic] you in this room the whole time when Lotta and I went to call the police?] in the original release) Morgan: Yes, of course. I was by Mystic Maya's side the entire time. I performed the Spirit Severing Technique and held her in my arms afterward. Phoenix: Hmm, you said that yesterday as well. Did anything else happen? Morgan: I would like to say more did, however that is all that occurred. Phoenix: (Ah, I was really hoping for some new info...) Morgan: I suppose nothing happened in the end, good sir. Sorry to have played on your hopes. Phoenix: (Could you possibly be more patronizing...?) (Chnaged from [Why do I feel like I was just made fun of in the worse way possible...?] in the original release) Training Phoenix: So do the students train every day? Morgan: Yes, absolutely. They were given a day off the day after the murder, of course, however... Phoenix: And I assume both Maya and Pearls went through this training...? Morgan: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ack! Yes, yes! (Wow, she got real scary, real fast...) Morgan: How many times must I tell you before you understand, good sir? They are to be addressed as Mystic Maya and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: S-Sorry... I meant Mystic Maya and Mystic Pearl... Wait... I'm sorry, but \"Mystic\" Pearl? Isn't that going a bit too far...? Morgan: Next question, please. Phoenix: (Oh man... She's really being a pain in the butt about this...) Morgan: Please remember to watch not only what you say, but how you say it, good sir. The Master Phoenix: So the Master is... um, Maya's mother, right? Morgan: ...Mystic Misty... She is a brilliant medium. Phoenix: And where is she now...? Morgan: We are not sure. Phoenix: Not sure? Morgan: About 16 or 17 years ago, Mystic Misty failed at channeling a certain spirit. And after that... she simply disappeared. Phoenix: ... Morgan: I don't believe she will return to this village, in any case. And in four years' time, her name will be forever erased from this village. Phoenix: ...Erased? Morgan: A person who has been away from the village for over 20 years is considered dead... Phoenix: Oh, I see. Morgan: And that is four years from now for her. When that happens, a new Master will be appointed to Kurain Village. Phoenix: And...? Morgan: Mystic Maya was supposed to become the next Master... However with this... murder, I'm afraid... Phoenix: (I must be imagining things... I thought she was laughing to herself for a second there...) Present Folding Screen Morgan: There are six parts to the Kurain Sacred Writings. To think that this valued treasure of our village... and Mystic Maya were both shot by a gun... Phoenix: Well, that's... Morgan: Even if it was something that occured during a channeling, it is an unforgivable act. Black Key Morgan: This... This is the key to this room! Phoenix: That's right. Morgan: B-But why do you have it, good sir!? Phoenix: That, I'm not telling. Morgan: R-Return it at once! Phoenix: I... I can't. It's evidence, after all. (I think she knows exactly how important this key is to this murder... But what is this feeling I'm getting from her? It feels... Hmm... I can't describe it.) Maya's Costume Morgan: That is Mystic Maya's costume, isn't it...? It's a shame. I never thought anything like that would happen to her... Phoenix: But we don't know that it was Maya that did it... Morgan: Oh, poor Mystic Maya. Phoenix: (Do you ever listen to anyone other than yourself?) Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Morgan: That is Mystic Maya before I applied the Spirit Severing Technique... This picture... It was taken without my express permission. I knew allowing a person like her from the \"Heartland\" into our country was a bad idea. Phoenix: (You do realize that the \"Heartland\" is a part of this country, right...?) Turner Grey profile Phoenix: About this person... Morgan: Oh! It is that man, is it not? A man who wishes to borrow a departed spirit's power to hide the lack of his own. What an insignificant man. And see how pitifully he died. Phoenix: Insignificant...? Morgan: That would mean you are that man's insignificant little friend, dear sir. Phoenix: (Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?) Mia Fey profile Morgan: ...Oh, my... I think I may know of this person from somewhere... Phoenix: It's Mia. You know, Maya's older sister? Morgan: ...! Aah! Yes, that is who she is... Phoenix: (...How could you forget a daughter of the Master...!?) Morgan: If memory serves, she became a lawyer. Oh, how splendid for her, don't you think? Phoenix: (That soft, kind smile... It's the kind that tells you a pair of devil horns are not too far away...) Pearl Fey profile Morgan: Come to think of it, I don't believe I have seen my child today. Would you happen to know where she is, good sir? Phoenix: N-No, I wouldn't. Morgan: Honestly! Take one day off from training, and it is neigh impossible to make it up. Good sir! I pray you are not teaching her strange, fiendish things in her time off! Phoenix: (Oh boy. Here comes her anger. ...And we were having such a civil conversation too...) Morgan Fey profile Morgan: Being born as one of the Fey family, but of weak spiritual power... It makes the people of this village look down upon you, you know? Phoenix: I-I didn't know that... Morgan: But I will be alright. ...As long as I have Pearl. I am satisfied because I have my Pearl. Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this? Morgan: I am terribly sorry, but I am afraid my spiritual powers are not as strong as you might think... I really am terribly sorry. Phoenix: (Um, but this has nothing to do with your spiritual power...) June 21Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Looks like there's no one here... And even though the weather is gorgeous today, it's raining inside my heart...) Examine Side Room entrance Phoenix: That's the \"Side Room\". Looks like guests can use it as a place to take a break when they feel tired. Urn Phoenix: It's a really old urn. There are the ashes of a person long dead inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on. June 21Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: (The bedding is all laid out today too. Guess I'll leave them alone for now...) Examine Sliding door Phoenix: It's still charming to see a real sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard. Bed on right Phoenix: ...Excuse me... ... (Who am I talking to? There's no one here.) Yellow box Phoenix: Hmm, I keep wondering about this box. I'm sure this wasn't here before the murder took place. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom. After presenting Black Key in Kurain Village: June 21Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Hey, there's someone by the incinerator... Ooh, looks like they've noticed me. And are now running at top speed towards me...) Ini: Oh, hey! *huff, huff* Like, *huff, huff* You're that dentist guy. Phoenix: Actually, it's Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. Nice to see you again. Ini: Ooh, like, real suave. So, it's, like, my turn. It's nice to see you, too. Phoenix: So, what's up? You're all out of breath... Ini: L-Like, huh? Oh! Like you mean... Like, I'm just totally happy and like, totally excited to be here. Phoenix: Excited? Ini: Like, I mean, there are so many things to, like, see! It's, like, the real deal here! Phoenix: Oh, really? For example...? Ini: For example... Like, that urn over there. Do you, like, know about it? Phoenix: (All I see is an old, cracked piece of pottery...) Examine Incinerator Phoenix: That's right... Pearls said she found this key inside the incinerator. I guess I should take a look inside for myself... ... Th-This... This is from Maya's costume...! There's blood on it... A tiny bit, but still... Cloth Scrap added to the Court Record. Incinerator (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, this piece of cloth was burned in this incinerator. And this key was also found in there. Hmm, I get the feeling this incinerator plays a crucial part in this murder... Urn (after clearing \"Sacred Urn\" Talk option) Phoenix: So there's a spirit in this urn, huh? Hmm, all I see are a bunch of cracks. But I guess maybe the spirit could live in the space between the cracks... Hmm, looks like something's written on it... \"I AM\"? Huh? Weird... Sacred Urn added to the Court Record. Urn (subsequent times) Phoenix: So there's a spirit in this urn, huh? Hmm, all I see are a bunch of cracks. But I guess maybe the spirit could live in the space between the cracks... Hmm, looks like something's written on it... \"I AM\"? Huh? Weird... Talk Sacred urn Phoenix: Is there some sort of legend connected with that urn? Ini: Like, yeah! It's, like, this village's treasure! Phoenix: Huh. Didn't know that. Ini: And, like, it's sealed inside that urn. Phoenix: ...Um... \"It's\"...? What are you talking about? Ini: Like, you know! Ami Fey's spirit! Phoenix: Ami... Fey...? Who's that? Ini: Like, jeez, Mr. Smith. Get with the program! Everyone knows the lady that founded the Kurain Channeling Technique was Mystic Ami. Phoenix: Um, you don't have to get upset with me... Ini: So, like, as long as her spirit, like, lives in that urn, the spiritual power of the Fey family'll stick around. Like, isn't that totally romantic? Phoenix: Umm... Romantic, huh...? (If that urn is really as important as she says, it could be a vital clue...) What happened Phoenix: Ini, I want to ask you about the murder... Ini: Murder...? Phoenix: Dr. Grey's... Remember...? (As if there's another one?) Ini: Oh, that one! Like, you shoulda said so in the first place! So, like, I totally don't know anything 'cause I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room. Phoenix: Well, that's not much help... Did you notice anything at all? Ini: Like, come on. What a total bore. I, like, totally have nothing to do with this, like, murder thing... Phoenix: (Oh, yeah. You only introduced Dr. Grey to Kurain Village. No relation, sure. Even if you were only \"acquaintances\", that still means you knew him. Furthermore, your sister, who died in that accident, was a nurse at his clinic...) Ini: ... Traffic accident (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Alright then. Why don't you tell me about your sister's fatal accident. Ini: ... Like, why? You think, like, it's got something to, like, do with the murder? Phoenix: I don't know yet, but I'm trying to chase down every lead I can... (Changed from [I don't know yet, but I'm trying to chase down every lead I have...] in the original release) 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Psy... Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [...A... A Psyche-Lock!] in the original release) Ini: Like, what is it? Phoenix: (Looks like I'm going to need something to pry her mouth open on this one...) Traffic accident (subsequent times) Phoenix: Um, about the accident, Ini... 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Ini: Like, you're totally not gonna give up, are you? Phoenix: No, I'm not. Ini: I totally want to forget about my sister, you know? Time to move on and all that. Phoenix: (Guess I have no choice but to remove those locks...) Present Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Ini: Wow, so, like, the Kurain technique is the real deal. I'm gonna, like, have to write about it in, like, my report for school. Hey, so, like, you'll give me this picture for, like, the report, right? Phoenix: No way! Maya Fey profile Ini: She's, like, in a lot of trouble, huh? Phoenix: (She's stealing quick glances at the picture while smiling like a cheshire cat...) Ini: But, like, this will totally prove the power of channeling. Phoenix: (...\"This\"? What \"this\" is she talking about...?) Pearl Fey profile Ini: Like, that's totally Mystic Maya's cousin, right? Phoenix: Yes. Her name is Pearl. Ini: Hmm? So, like, this little kid is, like, the next Master...? Phoenix: Oh, no, no, no. Maya is the next in line to be Master. Ini: Ah, oh yeah. Like, that's right. After clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber, and presenting Black Key in Kurain Village, then examining incinerator in Fey Manor - Winding Way: June 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: Hey, Nick... I've been waiting... Phoenix: (...She looks so helpless...) Maya: So? So? How was it!? What did you find out!? Phoenix: Um... Well... I found a few things... Maya: Is it so bad that you can't even look me in the eye? (Changed from [My eyes are tearing up, Nick. Don't make me cry...] in the original release) Phoenix: I... I just need a little more time. It'll all come together by tomorrow, I promise. Maya: I'm sorry, Nick. Every time I see you, all I do is cause trouble... Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So how was it? Today's trial, I mean... Maya: You were fantastic, Nick! Every time I thought our goose was cooked, you managed to turn it all around. I bet it would make a great Hollywood movie! Phoenix: Don't be silly. We have to concentrate on the trial. We're going to win this, Maya! Maya: ...Thanks a lot. Really. Hey, Nick? The person who shot Dr. Grey wasn't me, was it? Phoenix: Of course not. You're completely innocent. Maya: If that were true, then I'd be really happy, but... there wasn't anyone else in that room with the two of us, right? Phoenix: Well, did you check behind the folding screen? Maya: Um... I took a quick glance, but there wasn't anyone there. Phoenix: Hmm... (That's exactly what Lotta said too...) Not guilty Maya: Um, Nick... Phoenix: Yeah? Maya: Why do you believe in me? Why do you think I didn't kill Dr. Grey? Phoenix: ...Because of something Mia told me. Maya: My sis? What did she tell you? Phoenix: She said that spirit mediums can't have dreams. When you're channeling, it's impossible for you to dream because your soul leaves you. Maya: Now that you mention it... Wait, then... then... I really am...? Phoenix: You are not the real murderer. I think that... maybe before you even called the spirit, you were drugged. Maya: Drugged...? Phoenix: I think this was planned from the very beginning. And you were set up to take the blame for killing Dr. Grey. Maya: That's... That's... Pearl's alibi (appears after clearing \"Pearl's alibi\" Talk option in Kurain Village) Phoenix: I want to ask you something about Pearls. Maya: Pearly? What about her? Phoenix: No matter what I try, she won't answer me. I want to know what she was doing at the time of the murder. Maya: Huh!? (Changed from [Hmm...] in the original release) W-Wait! Nick! Y-You don't think she did it, do you!? Phoenix: No, no, nothing like that... Maya: She'd never do anything like that! You hear me!? Never! She's a great kid, and really cute... And really great... And cute. Phoenix: I didn't really think she was the murderer. But... she's definitely hiding something. Maya: Hmm... Phoenix: You were with her on that day, right? Maya: Yeah. The two of us. We were playing with her ball. Phoenix: A ball, huh? (Sounds like a dead-end to me...) Ball (appears after \"Pearl's alibi\") Phoenix: So, about this ball... Maya: It's nothing really special... Just a plain old ball. I think she was still playing with it when I started the channeling job that day. Pearly really loves to play with that ball. Phoenix: She \"loves to play with that ball\", huh...? Maya: When she wants to get it, she always climbs right into the clothing box. Phoenix: The clothing box? Maya: Yeah. Pearly's always hiding in there. You know the Side Room? There's a clothing box in there. It's really big, so once you see it, I'm sure you'll know what I'm talking about. Phoenix: (The clothing box in the Side Room, huh?) Present Attorney's Badge Maya: It's the same as the last time I saw it. You just like to show it off, don't you, Nick? Are you that thrilled to be a lawyer? Phoenix: Th-That's not what I meant by it, but... I mean, I don't really think about it. I just sort of shove it in people's faces... Force of habit, I guess. Folding screen Maya: That hole... It looks an awful lot like a bullet hole... Phoenix: That's probably what it is. Maya: That's TERRIBLE! How could this happen to such an important screen!? Phoenix: ... Um, instead of dwelling on the hole, let's focus on the fact that you weren't shot... Maya: ... Hey, you're right! So I was the one who was about to get shot, huh? Th-That's TERRIBLE! Who'd want to shoot little ol' me!? Phoenix: (I guess she didn't realize she was the one being shot at until now...) Black Key Maya: Ah! That's... The Channeling Chamber's... Phoenix: This is the only one in the world, right? Maya: Yeah. During the trial, I was kinda wondering why you had it... Phoenix: I got it from Pearls. Maya: That's weird... I swear I locked the door... and then put the key into one of my pouchy sleeves... Phoenix: Your sleeve? But how and when would your sleeve leave the room? It didn't grow a pair of legs... Maya: I wonder where Pearly found that key... Knife Maya: That's a knife from my family's kitchen. I'll never be able to use it again... Phoenix: It's alright. I'll buy you a new one, OK? Maya: Argh! That's not the point! ...I don't ever want to see another knife... ever again... Maya's Costume Maya: That... That's... That's mine, isn't it? Phoenix: (Dammit! I upset her again...) Maya: It really was me, wasn't it? Wasn't it, Nick? Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Maya: This... This is me, right? I guess I really did shoot Dr. Grey... Phoenix: But that's not you! Maya: Is too! Phoenix: Is not! Maya: Is too, is too! Phoenix: (I should've kept this picture to myself...) Sacred Urn Maya: That's Kurain's Sacred Urn. Mystic Ami's soul is sealed inside of it. Phoenix: Yeah, I know all about it. About how she's the founder of the Kurain Technique. Maya: Ooh, look at Mr. Smarty here! Thinks he knows all! You sound like an occult fanatic. Phoenix: (...Trust me, this isn't going on my resume any time soon...) Maya: You know, I haven't looked at this in a long time. I wonder when it became so cracked? Cloth Scrap Maya: ...What is it? Phoenix: I'm not too sure myself, but I found it just now inside the furnace. Maya: Huh? Is it trash burning day already? Phoenix: That's not something I would know about... (I guess she didn't notice the bloodstain. Probably better that way...) Mia Fey profile Maya: What am I supposed to do, sis!? ... Pearl Fey profile Maya: Pearly... She definitely has more than me... Phoenix: Huh? What are you talking about? Maya: Who I think the next Master should be... I mean, she's got more spiritual power than me, and she really works hard at her training... Phoenix: (Way to go Phoenix... Way to bring the mood down even further... *sigh*) Franziska von Karma profile Maya: So she's Prosecutor von Karma's daughter, huh? Phoenix: Looks like it. Maya: Well, then... she'd know about that person, right? Phoenix: (\"That person\"...? Is she talking about \"him\"?) It's alright. We don't need to talk about that right now... Maya: ... Ami Fey profile Maya: ...Mystic Ami. She's a Legendary Spirit Medium. I like the way that word sounds... \"Legendary\"... Ever since I was young, I've dreamed of being a \"Legend\". Phoenix: (Well, this murder will make you into a \"legend\", alright... Hmm... I probably shouldn't say that last thought out loud...) Any other evidence Maya: Um, I can't think of anything special about it... After clearing \"Ball\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: June 21Kurain Village Phoenix: Ah! Lotta: AAAAAAAAH! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait! Please! Lotta! ... (She ran off into the manor...) June 21Fey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: Lotta... Lotta: Aaack! Phoenix: H-Hey! I'm tellin' ya, quit followin' me, ya hear!? I'm a worthless piece of trash! Ya lay eyes on me, and they'll turn ta dust! Phoenix: (...*sigh*...) Channeling Chamber Phoenix: Hey! Morgan! Morgan: Yes, what is it? ...And must you be so noisy!? We have a rule here: \"The hallway is not for running\" Now then, in a calm manner ask your question. Phoenix: Okay... Anyway, did you see Lotta come by here? Morgan: Ah, that girl from the \"Heartland\"... I'm sorry, but she did not pass by here at any time. Phoenix: (Grr... Lotta! You sure know how to waste a man's time...) June 21Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: I'm pretty sure I saw Lotta run in this direction... but it doesn't look like she's here... Examine Ball Phoenix: It's Pearl's ball. Maya said that it's always kept in the clothing box... So then, what is it doing on the floor...? Pearl's Ball taken. Clothing box Phoenix: It's the clothing box where Pearl's ball is usually kept. I wonder what's inside... Aaaaah! Phoenix: Whaaaa!? Wh-Wh-What were you doing in there!? What were you thinking!? Lotta: I'm a bad person! Just another piece of human trash. I needed a hole to crawl into... Phoenix: ... (So you crawled into this clothing box because there wasn't a hole to crawl into? Oh man... ...Huh?) There's a small hole in this clothing box... And it's about... 8 inches off the ground! That's the same height as the hole in the folding screen! Then, could this...? Clothing Box added to the Court Record. Clothing box (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's the clothing box where Pearls keeps her ball. I thought I felt my soul shake when Lotta jumped out at me. So it's big enough to fit a grown adult... Well, if she can be called an adult... June 21Fey ManorMeditation Room Pearl: Oh, Mr. Nick! That person ran by here just now. Phoenix: What person? Pearl: Um, you know... The person with the fluffy cotton candy hair... Phoenix: (Ah, she means Lotta.) Pearl: She said, \"Don't look at me with 'em eyes!\" but... I'm not that scary, am I...? Phoenix: ...I don't think that's quite what she meant. Pearl: Oh, that's right. She also wanted me to tell you, \"Goin' on a trip to find myself, so don't ya bother findin' me!\" Phoenix: O-Oh... Well, thanks. Pearl: You're welcome. Talk Pearl's alibi (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: Around when Mystic Maya started the channeling on that day, I was playing in the Winding Way... with my ball. Phoenix: And that's when you... broke the urn? Pearl: Y-Yes... I broke it... I... I accidentally let Mystic Ami's spirit fly away! Phoenix: Don't worry. Morgan will never know, OK? Pearl: I'm a bad child... Breaking a village treasure is unforgivable. I thought... that maybe they would make me leave the village. But the broken pieces were pretty big, so... Phoenix: You thought you could put them back together, and no one would notice? Pearl: ...Yes. Sacred Urn (appears after \"Pearl's alibi\") Pearl: I found some glue and brought it to the hallway... and fixed the urn there. Phoenix: The hallway? You mean \"Winding Way\"? Pearl: Yes. The channeling had already started, so I didn't think anyone would walk by. Phoenix: Hmm, I see... So, about how long did it take you? It must have been a nasty repair job. Pearl: Yes. I might be strong at spiritual things, but when it comes to arts and crafts, I am not nearly as skilled. When I had finished fixing the urn and looked up, I saw you coming into the manor... Phoenix: (So that's around when Lotta and I were coming back inside after reporting the murder.) Pearl: When I saw that, I packed everything up in a hurry. Um... Mr. Nick? Phoenix: What is it, Pearls? Pearl: I'm... I'm going to get banished, aren't I? Phoenix: I really don't think that's going to happen. I mean, I bet Mystic Ami's happy to be free from that cramped urn. Pearl: Y-Yeah, I hope so... Phoenix: (No harm done, and a happy resolution... Phew!) Sacred Urn updated in the Court Record.

Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Pearl's Alibi -- Phoenix: Pearl. You have to tell me what you were doing when the murder happened, OK? Pearl: Um... But what if I can't just tell you what happened...? Phoenix: Then I'll guess what happened. How does that sound? Pearl: What!? Y-You can do that? (Changed from [Eh!? Y-You can do that?] in the original release) Phoenix: You'll tell me if I guess something right, won't you? Pearl: ...Y-Yes... Phoenix: Now, when the murder was taking place, you were here, right? Present Winding Way Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were here, weren't you Pearls -- in the Winding Way?\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: I'm pretty smart, Pearls. I know you were right here.

Leads back to: \"Now, when the murder was taking place, you were here, right?\" Phoenix: You were here, weren't you Pearls -- in the Winding Way? Pearl: W-Wow! ...Y-You got it. Phoenix: So? Do you think you can tell me now? Pearl: ...I'm sorry... Not yet... Phoenix: Man, oh man... Alright, what next...? OK, I think I know what you were doing there. Pearl: D-Do you really know that much? Phoenix: Well, I am a lawyer, you know. Now, what was it Pearls was doing in the Winding Way? Present Pearl's Ball Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were... playing with this ball, right?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... Phoenix: So? Pearl: I feel just a little better. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: You are a lawyer, but you're also still a person, after all... Phoenix: Sorry, I'll get it right this time... Leads back to: \"OK, I think I know what you were doing there.\" Phoenix: You were... playing with this ball, right? Pearl: Ah! That's right! How... How did you know...? 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Maya told me that you love to play with your ball. Pearl: Um... Yeah. I was playing with my ball. Phoenix: Un, huh. And then? Pearl: ... Phoenix: Something happened, huh? ...Something really bad... Pearl: *gulp!* Wh-What do you mean, \"something\"!? N-N-Nothing happened...! Phoenix: This is it. While you were playing with your ball, this happened! Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Leads to: \"This urn... It's a village treasure, right?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... Phoenix: Were you so surprised that you were shocked into silence? Pearl: ...Yes, at how wrong you are, even though you were so sure of yourself... Phoenix: ...Huh? (Way to embarrass yourself in front of an 8 year old, Wright...) Ah, sorry, sorry. Just see if you were paying attention... Ah heh heh. Pearl: It's okay Mr. Nick. You can always try again. Leads back to: \"This is it.\" Phoenix: This urn... It's a village treasure, right? Pearl: Ah... Um... Phoenix: And the spirit of the founder of the Kurain technique is sealed in here, isn't it? Pearl: ...Y-Yes... Phoenix: What's this? It's cracked all over, isn't it? There's even a few gaps here and there... Pearl: Um... Please don't tease me... Phoenix: Pearl, you broke the Sacred Urn, didn't you? Pearl: ...! Phoenix: The ball smacked into it and knocked it over, right? And if Morgan found out, she'd get really mad, huh? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (She doesn't seem to be fighting back... I think I hit the bull's-eye this time. But it's strange that the lock hasn't broken yet...) Pearl: I-It's... It's a really old urn, isn't it? Phoenix: I-I guess? (Changed from [Eh?] in the original release) Pearl: I-I-It's so old... So it's not that weird... to have a few cracks... Phoenix: (Her voice is shaking...) Pearl: H-How can you tell that urn has been broken!? Present Ami Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Who started the Kurain Channeling Technique?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ...I'm sorry. I don't want to be mean, but... Phoenix: (*sigh* I figured...) Pearl: Um, do you want to try again? Phoenix: Yeah. (I'm sure I can get it if I think about it some more! The thing I'm missing... must have something to do with what's written on the urn...) Leads back to: \"H-How can you tell that urn has been broken!?\" Phoenix: Who started the Kurain Channeling Technique? Pearl: Huh? (Changed from [Eh?] in the original release) Oh, um, it was Mystic Ami... (Changed from [Um, it was Mystic Ami...] in the original release) Phoenix: That's right. And how do you spell her name? Do you know? Pearl: How do I spell her name? Um... I don't know... Phoenix: It's spelled \"A-M-I\". Pearl: *gasp!* Phoenix: I thought it was a little odd when I saw \"I AM\" written on this urn. Pearl: ... Phoenix: And that's how I knew that someone must have broken this urn. And made a mistake in spelling when they put it back together again... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful After examining the \"Clothing box\"  in Fey Manor - Side Room and adding it to the Court Record: June 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: M-Mia! Mia: Phoenix, it's good to see you. I was really worried so I thought I'd see how you were doing. Phoenix: ...You might get caught on film again... Mia: There are certain risks you have to take in life, or in my case, death. Anyway, how are you doing? Have you found anything useful? Phoenix: Um, only a little. I think I'm slowly beginning to understand everything, piece by piece. Mia: Everything will resolve itself by tomorrow, somehow. Talk Tomorrow's trial Mia: There's still a whole slew of questions for you to answer before the trial tomorrow. Phoenix: You mean like how did the real murderer get into the room and kill Dr. Grey...? Mia: Yes. Also, when did the murderer enter the Channeling Chamber...? You guys were all standing around in front of the room after the channeling started. Phoenix: Which means that the murderer must have gone into that room before the channeling... Mia: That's what I think, in any case. Phoenix: But Maya's already said there wasn't anyone else in there. Mia: ...That's true... But if we can't figure out the murderer's movements, we're stuck like a beached whale. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Kurain Channeling Technique Mia: I thought I'd never see this day. Are you actually asking me about spirit channeling? Phoenix: This case is all about spirit channeling. And I feel like I don't understand a thing about it... Mia: Well, that's only natural... After all, spirit channeling isn't exactly an everyday thing, is it? Phoenix: Yeah, I guess you're right. Mia: The power to change your physical appearance into the person you're calling was something our ancestor, Mystic Ami Fey acquired. Phoenix: I've heard that name before... Mia: The Fey family was originally a family known for its service to the gods. When Mystic Ami was born, she was given a certain fate through her name. Because, you see, she was named after one of the Buddhas of Buddhism, \"Amitábha\". To this day, her soul is still sealed in the Kurain Sacred Urn. It usually sits in the Winding Way, and has her name written on it. Phoenix: Um, yeah... Mia: Aww, come on, Phoenix. It's just a fairy-tale. Phoenix: (Are you saying that me being able to see you is just a fairy-tale too...?) Present Anything Mia: Come on, Phoenix. We don't have time to be looking at things like this. We need to find out everything we can for the trial tomorrow. After clearing all Talk options: Mia: Well, it's about time I left. Phoenix: M-Mia! Mia: We'll be in big trouble if the guard sees me here... Phoenix... Phoenix: Yes, Chief! Mia: There is still a lot of dirt left in this case. Once you think you've gathered all the evidence, then come back. Phoenix: ...Yes, Chief. After clearing \"Sacred Urn\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Meditation Room: June 21Kurain Village Phoenix: (Phew. I think I've found everything I can. But I can't see how it all adds up... Hmm... (Changed from [But I can't see how they all add up... Hmm...] in the original release)) ...H... He... Phoenix: (And is Ini Miney being here just a coincidence...?) ...Hey, Mister... Phoenix: (How is it that the spirit Dr. Grey wanted to call just happened to be that nurse, and that nurse turns out to be Ini's sister... It's too... convenient...) ...Hey! Phoenix! I'm talkin' to you! Phoenix: (I wish I knew a little more about Ini, but where am I going to find info like that?) Oh, I get it. Ya can't be bothered to look over at trash like me. Is that it, Mr. High-and-Mighty!? Phoenix: Aah! L-Lotta! Lotta: Oh, so ya finally noticed! Phoenix: (I thought I heard a mosquito buzzing in my ear, although I couldn't understand a word...) Lotta: Well, I gotta hand it to ya. Ya sure know how to chase down garbage! I mean, I'm grateful to ya for chasin' this large lump of one around like this. Phoenix: Um... Thanks...? Lotta: But ya know, you're just wastin' yer time. I'll be fine on my own. Phoenix: Wh-What are you going on about? And as for \"following\" or \"chasing\" or whatever it is, isn't that what YOU'RE doing!? Lotta: Um, well, ya see... Well, yer not exactly a real gentleman with a lady's heart, are ya? Phoenix: (You're not exactly the world's number one charmer either, sister.) Talk Today's trial Lotta: Look, I'm really dang sorry about today! When I get all fired up about somethin', it's impossible to stop me. Phoenix: You hurt Maya really badly, Lotta. Lotta: Um... I don't suppose you could forgive a gal like me...? Forgive her Phoenix: Well, I guess. You did help Maya out too, after all. Lotta: For real? Phoenix: Yeah, for real. Lotta: Ah, thank goodness... I'm still... Phoenix: \"I'm still...\" what...? Lotta: N-No, no, nothing, nothing at all. Just talkin' to myself, ya know, gibberish... ...Now then! Lotta Hart, at your service! Phoenix: ? Lotta: I'll share with ya all the dirt I've dug up! Phoenix: Th-Thanks. Lotta: Hey, don't be all surprised! Tell ya what, I'll even give ya all this info for free! Phoenix: (Lotta not taking money? Now I KNOW this one's an alien clone...) Leads back to Talk options Don't forgive her Phoenix: I'm not done... Lotta: Um... Phoenix: And to think we trusted you, Lotta, and what do you do!? You stab us in the back! You stressed us all out and even gave Maya a few strands of white hair! Lotta: Urngh... Phoenix: Now I'm going to have to pray she makes it, or she may come back as a ghost... Lotta: Ack! That's enough! Ya can stop right there! Look, I'll tell ya everything I know! Everything! I'll spill it all! Phoenix: Everything? Lotta: Yeah, ya got it! Everything! But... Well, actually... Tell ya what, I'll even do it for free! Phoenix: (You were expecting me to pay you after what you did to us!?) Leads back to Talk options The murderer Phoenix: If Maya is not the real murderer, then... who do you think is, Lotta? Lotta: Well heck, ain't it obvious? It's that occult freak! Phoenix: You mean Ini Miney? Lotta: Well, there ain't anyone else it could be, right? That granny, you and me, we were all together that whole time... Phoenix: (So, Lotta suspects Ini... Which means she might have already found some info about our mysterious Ini...) Ini Miney (appears after \"Today's trial\" and presenting Ini Miney profile) Phoenix: Speaking of Ini, do you have any other information about her? Lotta: Sure. Phoenix: Well, what is it!? Lotta: Ha ha ha... It'll cost ya... And it'll cost a lot! Phoenix: (Oh, silly me. Here I thought \"free\" meant \"no money necessary\".) Lotta: That girl was hospitalized about half a year ago. Phoenix: Hospitalized...? But why? Lotta: Well, heck, you can go find out on yer own. Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: Here, I'll give ya the clinic's address. Maybe ya can find out something. Phoenix: \"Maybe\"...? What's that supposed to mean!? Lotta: Well... See, actually, it was gonna be annoying, I reckoned, so I didn't actually go there. Phoenix: Aargh... Lotta: Well, that's the way the gumbo spoils, right? Phoenix: Spoiled gumbo sounds... Eww... I mean, look, don't blame this on... Oh, never mind! (Looks like I don't have much of a choice. Better go check out this \"Hotti Clinic\"...) Present Newspaper Clipping 1 or Newspaper Clipping 2 Phoenix: About this clipping... Lotta: Now, you listen here, boy, and listen good. You can't go lookin' at such an old piece of paper, ya hear!? People's got eyes on the front side. You know why? So they can see in front of themselves! Not behind! So how about it? You feelin' my energy? Phoenix: (Nope, not an electron.) Pistol Lotta: Ya think I could have the guts to carry one of these around? A celebrity photographer with a gun? Ya think it'd work? \"Bang, bang!!\" ...Nah... Thanks, but nah. I can't see myself like that. Knife or Maya's Costume Lotta: Aaaaah! Th-There's... There's blood on it!! Get that away from me! Where do you get off showin' somethin' like this to me!? Phoenix: (Oops, guess that was the wrong thing to show her...) Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Lotta: I'm a real natural, aren't I? I caught the murder just right, and even managed to make it mysterious. Phoenix: Mysterious!? All you managed to do was forget to focus your lens! Lotta: Shaddup! That's my technique! My technique, now, ya hear!? Turner Grey profile Lotta: Hey, it's that Dr. Grey guy. It's a pity what happened to him. Pretty scary what ghouls and ghosts can do to a man, huh? Gawd rest his poor soul. Phoenix: (Hmm... Since when was Lotta so religious...?) Maya Fey profile Lotta: Now, this kid -- I think she needs to be taught some manners. This here's her second time in the stew, right? My Pa woulda slapped me straight! Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Lotta: Ya know what they say, if there's a second time, there's bound to be a third, and a fo- OW! Nngh... Ya didn't have to slap me. I get it, I get it. Sorry... Pearl Fey profile Lotta: Hmm... I overlooked this little kid. Phoenix: Wh-What do you mean? Lotta: I mean, I didn't think it, but ya know how it's always 'em silent types? Phoenix: H-Huh!? Wait, wait, wait... Lotta: The little tyke's nothin' but a ball of happy goodness, right? So I reckon, she's the type to have done it! Well, now, that's just how the world turns. Phoenix: I don't think this has anything to do with how the world turns... Morgan Fey profile Lotta: That old lady sure can be forceful. She scared me that day. ...Well, only a little, now, ya hear? Ini Miney profile Lotta: Heh, that's Ini Miney, right? Phoenix: Yeah. I was wondering if you know anything about this girl... Lotta: Ya know! Actually, I did a little checkin' up on her the other day. Her sister, she's the one that Dr. Grey wanted to call back from the spirit world. Phoenix: Yeah, I had heard as much... I had also heard that Ini was the one to introduce Dr. Grey to Kurain Village. Lotta: Ya don't say? That's one sneaky gal, if you ask me... Hey, ya want me to tell ya more about her? Lotta Hart profile Lotta: Ya know, I'm beginnin' to get sick of this hairstyle. Next time I go to the salon, I'm gonna get my hair straightened, I reckon. What do ya think, Phoenix? Phoenix: I think if you got rid of your afro, I wouldn't recognize who you were. Lotta: Yeah, that's kinda the problem, ain't it? Phoenix: (Please, can we get on with the important stuff...? Say, like the murderer...) Franziska von Karma profile Lotta: Hey, this is that prosecutor gal. The one that likes breakin' all the rules. Switches are for horses and lights, not people! How's that? I made a pretty clever pun, didn't I? Phoenix: ...Sorry, didn't hear you. Lotta: Ah, well, I'll forgive the wax in yer ears this once and tell it to ya one more time.

If you don't behave, you'll get yourself tossed out of this hospital! Phoenix: (Wow. I didn't think nurses could be this direct or forceful towards their boss.) Nurse: Come now.

A strong jolt woke her up, and the next minute, a sea of fire was all around her. Miss Ini fought with the door, finally got it to open, and somehow managed to get away. ...Anywhoo, you can read all the details in the article. Hmm, yes... Phoenix: (A new clue! I should probably look this over.) Present Attorney's Badge Hotti: Hmm? What's this? Phoenix: I'm a lawyer. Right now, I'm investigating a murder. Hotti: Hmm, hmm, yes... What is with your angry face? Violence isn't the answer, hmm, yes... Phoenix: The trial is tomorrow. And I would really like some information from you. Hotti: Hmm... Is that right...? ...Well, you know, I think I can let you in on a little secret... Phoenix: What's that? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Actually, ... I'm not the real Director. Phoenix: Are you kidding!? Anyone with half a fly's brain knew that! Hotti: Eh!? Wh-What do you mean!? Phoenix: (Do I have to explain this to him...?) Hotti: Well, hmm... Hold on. I'll give you something. Real information, OK? Phoenix: ? Hotti: I'm actually, this clinic's... See, I'm like this place's... \"walking dictionpedia\"...? Phoenix: You mean \"walking encyclopedia\"? Hotti: Y-Yeah, that. And my specialty is in young, silky-smooth hottie patients... There's nothing I don't know about them... But I get \"embarrassed\" talking about it. Phoenix: ...Yeah... How about you keep that kind of information to yourself...? Hotti: Hoh, hoh, hoh. Anyway, you wanted to know about Little Miss Ini Miney, right? (Changed from [Hoh, hoh, hoh. Anyway, you wanted to know about Miss Ini Miney, right?] in the original release) Phoenix: (\"Little Miss\" Ini Miney?) (Changed from [\"Miss\" Ini Miney?] in the original release) Hotti: That girl... Ah, I remember her especially well... Really, especially, very well... Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Hotti: Now this is what I'm talking about! Hmm, yes... nice. This is nice and exciting. Phoenix: What do you think? Does anything grab your attention? Hotti: There's no mistaking this is nice... Hmm, yes... I like... Yes... I like this picture... Hmm, yes... Mind if I borrow this for a while...? For... \"private research\" purposes... Phoenix: Umm, that's okay... (I don't think I should support his \"research\"...) License Photo or Ini Miney profile Hotti: Mmm... Miss Ini is really cute in this picture. You'd agree, right? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, sure. Hotti: I wish I could see her again. Maybe the next time she has a big accident. Hmm, yes... Phoenix: ...I'll tell her for you... Hotti: Hmm, yes... Please... Hmm... I'll be waiting for her... Hmm... Yes... Waiting... Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So about this girl... Hotti: Hmm... She is... Um... Not the best... Hmm, yes... But she'd be a great candidate for surgery... Hmm, yes, yes... Hmm... That's really the only thing I can prescribe for her... Phoenix: (...What is he talking about? What surgery...?) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Would you please take a look at this person...? Hotti: Oooh... This is, this is... ...A superb example of a woman... I'd like to... hmm, meet her... just one time... Bring her to me tomorrow. Hmm... She'll get special attention from me, I promise. Phoenix: (Wh-Where does he think he is!? This is a medical facility!!) Pearl Fey profile Phoenix: So, about this girl... Hotti: Isn't she the patient down in room 206...? Hmm, yes... I'm sure that cute nurse is taking very good care of her. That nurse said the girl has chicken pox... or was it measles... Maybe the flu...? Phoenix: (Um, Pearls is fine and well, although I feel sorry for the nurse now.) Mimi Miney profile Phoenix: About this person... Hotti: Hmm... Hmm... I feel like... I feel like... Somewhere... I've seen her somewhere before, I think... Hmm... Hmm... Well, when she comes tomorrow for her consultation, I'm sure we can get re-acquainted... Phoenix: (...I don't believe this...) Franziska von Karma profile Phoenix: This person... Hotti: Ooh, she's nice. That look in her eye... She looks like a queen. She's glaring at me. Hmm... Ah, her stare is making me choke up in tears. Phoenix: ...I... I was whipped by her... And it hurt... a lot... Hotti: Oh, wow! I am so JEALOUS! So? Did you cry? How did it feel? Phoenix: (...I cried a little... I think...? I can't actually remember...) Director Hotti (purported) profile Hotti: Oh, it's me. Hmm, yes... My tuft of hair... It's so nice. Shows off my smartness... You should try it too. My new hairstyle that I invented... Phoenix: ...Ah, that's OK. I'll pass on this one... Any other evidence Phoenix: Um, so what do you know about this...? Hotti: I see this and, um, my mind's blank. Hmm, yes. It's boring, that's why. Boring. Hmm, yes... How do I put it? If you had more... Hmm... More attractive items... Yes... Phoenix: (...Attractive...? Huh?) Any other profile Phoenix: So, I'd like to ask you about this person... Hotti: Hmm... Something tells me... Hmm, yes... Umm... No, nothing. There is no need to bring this person in for an exam. Wouldn't do it anyway. Hmm... Phoenix: (Even as a pretend doctor, he gets an F from me...) After clearing \"The operation\" and \"The accident\" Talk options: Hotti: It's been half a year since Miss Ini had her surgery and got better. She was discharged sometime in December last year. Phoenix: (It's already been half a year, huh...?) Hotti: Hmm, yes... So, how was I? I was a real help, wasn't I? Hmm, yes... Phoenix: Y-Yes... Thank you very much. Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, then, I'll be getting back to my room then. Tell Miss Ini I said hi, OK? Hmm, yes... Phoenix: (It's time for me to leave too, hmm, yes... Ack! OK, it's definitely time to leave!) June 21Kurain Village Lotta: Hey! So how was it!? Didja go to the clinic? Phoenix: Yeah... I found out a few things... I guess... Lotta: ...What's the matter? Ya ain't lookin' so well. Ah, yeah. So earlier, that ol' granny called the cops. Phoenix: ...Huh? The cops? Why would Morgan call the police? Lotta: She said she had \"somethin' to tell 'em\". Things are sure gettin' interestin'. Talk Morgan Lotta: Ah, but honestly, I tell ya, that granny sure got her bloomers in a knot. Phoenix: Well, I guess you could put it that way... Lotta: It always starts out small, ya know? Stealin' the Master's seat, and controllin' the village folk... and now ya see what it's turned into? A murder, that's what. Phoenix: Yeah, what a mess. ... H-Hey, hold on! Lotta: What? Phoenix: That stuff you were just talking about... That's the first I've heard of it. Lotta: Heh, really? Well, it's old news to everyone else in the world. Phoenix: (Well, excuse me for not keeping up with gossip while I'm busy saving people!) Phoenix: You said something about \"stealing the Master's seat\"? Lotta: Yup. Right now, the Master is this medium named Misty Fey, but... the one that was really supposed to be the Master was that old granny. Phoenix: (Morgan was supposed to become... the Master...?) Ini Miney Phoenix: Do you know where Ini is, Lotta? Lotta: Yeah, I saw her not too long ago. She's hangin' around that garden in the middle. Phoenix: OK, thanks. Lotta: Ya got somethin' to ask her? Phoenix: (Yeah. I've got a whole list of things only she can clear up for me...) The Master (appears after \"Morgan\") Lotta: So I hear the Master has always been the oldest daughter. Phoenix: The oldest daughter...? Lotta: Turns out, that old bat is Misty Fey's older sister... Phoenix: O-Oh? Lotta: They say the older sister is usually the one with more spiritual power. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Maya said the same thing a long time ago... She warned me not to take Mia's powers lightly...) Lotta: Well, anyway... somehow, granny there lost to her younger sister, Misty. Phoenix: I see... Lotta: This made the townsfolk turn against her, so I hear. Said all sorta things too, like, \"She's the oldest, and yet she doesn't have the power to be the next Master. Disgraceful.\" Phoenix: (Wow. I had no idea...) ...So what would've happened had Morgan been stronger...? Lotta: Maya's family woulda been the branch family, I reckon. June 21Fey ManorWinding Way Ini: Hey! Like, I haven't seen you in a while... Phoenix: Yeah. (I think I have enough to finally unlock her secret...) Ini: ...Like, what's with that scary look on your face...? Talk Traffic accident (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Ini: Yeah... I was... riding... Riding in that car... with my sister. We were... like, on our way home... I was riding in the passenger seat when I fell asleep... ...And then, it happened. At the time, I grabbed for my purse, and escaped from the passenger-side door. Phoenix: ...And your sister...? Ini: I, like, couldn't do anything... The car was full of smoke... I couldn't see anything... Phoenix: Oh, I'm sorry... Dr. Grey (appears after \"Traffic accident\") Phoenix: Did Dr. Grey really cause that accident by drugging your sister with sleeping pills? Ini: Like, he was totally out to get my sister... He totally did that to, like, pay my sister back... Phoenix: (Hmm, I wonder... This does give Ini a good reason to want to murder Dr. Grey!) Ini: Ha ha ha. It seems simple, doesn't it? Phoenix: What do you mean!? Ini: But, it would be very hard to catch me. Actually, I'd say impossible. Phoenix: What!? Ini: I think you get the picture. I'm going to serve you a slice of humble pie! I hope you enjoy it. Ha ha ha... Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Traffic Accident -- Phoenix: Please tell me about the traffic accident. Ini: Huh? Like, whose accident? Phoenix: Your sister's accident, naturally! Ini: Oh... Um, oh, yeah... So, like, that Dr. Grey guy made my sister fall asleep... And, like, that's all I have to say about that. Phoenix: Hmm... (Interesting... Ini just asked, \"Whose accident?\"... Which means... She must know something about another person's accident...) Alright, let's change the topic, then. How about you tell me about a certain other person's accident? Ini: Huh? Another person's accident...? Like, you got someone in mind? Present License Photo or Ini Miney profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I want to ask you about your own car accident.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Ini: Oh wow. So, like, that person had a car accident too? Phoenix: You can't tell me you don't know. Ini: Like, how would I know if that person, like, had an accident? Phoenix: Oh.

Ini: Like, let's make sure we're on the same page. I, like, want proof I was in an accident. Phoenix: (I thought I'd ease into this topic, but...) It doesn't matter what you say, I know you were in a car accident! Leads back to: \"So, wow, like, how strange. I have, like, no idea what you're talking about.\" Phoenix: Would you take a look at this? It's a newspaper article from one year ago. It says, \"Ms. Ini Miney Holds Interview About Crash\".

Ini: I mean, like, this person has, like, the same name, but she's totally not me. My name, \"Ini Miney\" is, like, pretty common. Phoenix: What in the world are you babbling about!? Your sister's name, \"Mimi Miney\" is in here too! Ini: Like, totally, wow... What a scary coincidence! I'm totally getting, like, goosebumps. Phoenix: (Y-You think I'm going to let you get away with that!?) Ini: So, like, now what? Like, do you have something that totally says I was hospitalized? Present License Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is your proof.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Ini: Um, like, you shouldn't throw, like, truffling things around, you know? Phoenix: ...Truffling?

Phoenix: I got this from the hospital where you were hospitalized at. Ini: H-Huh? So? Phoenix: There was a certain patient there. He's quite a fan... As a memento of your stay, he stole this. I have to say, this photo looks like you. Ini: ...That creepy fake Director! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Now are you ready to tell me about the accident...? Ini: Like, wait a sec. OK, so, like, I was in an accident. Sure. But that's, like, totally not related to this murder! Phoenix: Actually, it is. Look at this article. It says that \"one of the women died\", correct? Ini: ...A-And? Phoenix: That woman who died -- who do you suppose they mean? Ini: ... Phoenix: Do you suppose the woman who died in that accident could be...? Present Mimi Miney profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I believe it was your sister, Mimi Miney.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you suppose it could be this person...? Ini: ... Like, no way. Phoenix: ...Huh? Ini: Like, the accident was, like, a year ago, so, like, what's this person got to do with it? I'm totally not interested in stupid people like you. Bye-bye... Phoenix: (...Ack, I have to stall her!) W-Wait! Look, I think I know who it is! Leads back to: \"Do you suppose the woman who died in that accident could be...?\" Phoenix: I believe it was your sister, Mimi Miney. Ini: Mimi...

While the murder was being committed, my aunt was outside with everyone else. Which means she already has an alibi. Phoenix: That's true... Mia: Show me some evidence that would cast suspicion onto my aunt. Present Black Key Phoenix: Phoenix: My evidence is this black key. Mia: ... Phoenix: At the beginning of the channeling, Maya had possession of this key. And yet, somehow, it magically ended up in the incinerator in the center garden. Mia: ...You're right. Phoenix: There is only one person who could have done that while I was busy calling the police. The person taking care of Maya -- Morgan. Mia: ... Phoenix: What's that look mean? Mia: Your argument is too flimsy. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: When did the key find its way into the incinerator? It could have happened long after the murder happened. Phoenix: Long after...? Mia: Someone could have found the key somewhere and dumped it into the incinerator. Phoenix: But that's... Mia: That prosecutor would use something this small to shred your case. Do you have something other than just the key to cast suspicion on Morgan? Present Cloth Scrap Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is the other piece of evidence that points to Morgan as the culprit.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Mia: Phoenix, we don't have any time left. Phoenix: (I haven't even said anything yet...) Mia: You can't pin my aunt as the murderer with one piece of evidence alone. Leads back to: \"Do you have something other than just the key to cast suspicion on Morgan?\" Phoenix: This is the other piece of evidence that points to Morgan as the culprit. Mia: ... Phoenix: I also found this in the garden incinerator. It's the same material as Maya's costume... Except for the splotch of blood. Mia: But this piece may not even be from Maya's costume. Phoenix: But this is what Maya told me. \"While I was channeling, the key was sitting inside my sleeve.\" And both this key and the piece of cloth were found inside the incinerator. Phoenix: Which means that this piece of cloth was a part of Maya's costume. Mia: But when Maya was arrested, she was wearing her costume. Phoenix: That just means someone changed her clothes. Mia: Changed her clothes? But why...? Phoenix: I don't know why. But... There is only one person who could've done that. Mia: The one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt. 1 LOCK BROKEN Leads to: \"You did very well, Phoenix.\" Present Cloth Scrap Phoenix: Phoenix: The proof is this piece of cloth. Mia: ... Phoenix: I found it in the incinerator near the Winding Way. It's the same material as Maya's costume... Except for the splotch of blood. Mia: You mean, it's from Maya's costume that she was wearing at the time of the murder? Phoenix: Yes. Mia: But when Maya was arrested, she was wearing her costume. Phoenix: That just means someone changed her clothes. Mia: Changed her clothes? But why...? Phoenix: I don't know why. But... There is only one person who could've done that. Mia: The one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt. ... Phoenix: What's that look mean? Mia: Your argument is too flimsy. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: You have no proof that this piece of cloth is actually from Maya's costume. Phoenix: But... this blood... Mia: And do you know whose blood that is at this point in time? You don't, do you? Do you have any proof that piece of cloth is from Maya's costume? Present Black Key Phoenix: Leads to: \"I think this is the proof you're looking for.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Mia: Phoenix, we don't have any time left.

Leads back to: \"Do you have any proof that piece of cloth is from Maya's costume?\" Phoenix: I think this is the proof you're looking for. Mia: ...The key to the Channeling Chamber, huh? Phoenix: At the beginning of the channeling, Maya had possession of this key. And yet, somehow, it magically ended up in the incinerator in the center garden. Mia: ...You're right. Phoenix: And this is what Maya told me. \"While I was channeling, the key was sitting inside my sleeve.\" And both this key and the piece of cloth were found inside the incinerator. Phoenix: Which means that this piece of cloth was a part of Maya's costume. Mia: It would certainly seem that way... Phoenix: Someone changed her into a different set of clothes. And then, burned the costume she was wearing in the incinerator. There is only one person who could've done that. Mia: The one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt.

Mia: As long as you have those two pieces of evidence, you can cast suspicion on my aunt. However. Phoenix: H-However? Mia: Like I said in the beginning, my aunt has an alibi. Phoenix: Yeah... She was with us the whole time... Mia: Here's my final question. You don't have to present solid proof of this for me. But I want to know. If my aunt is the culprit, then how did she commit the murder? Phoenix: How she did it, huh...? Mia: I want to hear your thoughts. In order for my aunt to murder Dr. Grey, who or what did she need...? Present Ini Miney profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Ini Miney. She's the answer to the final question.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: ... (No idea... Just throwing things out now...) Mia: ...And you were so close too, Phoenix. Phoenix: Yeah... Mia: There is no way my aunt could have done it herself. So, thinking logically, where does that leave you? Should be easy for you to figure out... Phoenix: (So, if Morgan couldn't have done it herself... Then...) Mia: Come on, Phoenix. Think. Leads back to: \"In order for my aunt to murder Dr. Grey, who or what did she need...?\" Phoenix: ...Ini Miney. She's the answer to the final question. Mia: Which means that my aunt and Ini Miney... Phoenix: ...Were in cahoots! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Mia: ...Something's been bothering me all this time. This crime is something no normal person could carry out. The person would have to know a lot about Fey Manor and the village itself to do this. Phoenix: ...But Morgan already has an alibi... Mia: Yes, which is why I can't figure out how it was done. We can assume that Ini Miney is involved somehow... Phoenix: But we have one big problem on our hands. Mia: ...A problem? With what? Phoenix: We don't have a motive. Why would Morgan want to kill Dr. Grey? Why would she have to? Also, we don't really know for sure that she was cooperating with Ini. Mia: ... Phoenix: (Mia doesn't have a clue either, huh?) Mia: Hmm... Then, there is only one possibility... Phoenix: Huh!? Mia: Think about it, Phoenix. Why would my aunt do something like this? And why would she do it in such an underhanded fashion? Phoenix: Um... because...? Mia: Mother... She is the one who holds the key to this. Phoenix: Mother? Whose? Mine? Mia: Don't be silly. Mine, of course! Misty Fey. Phoenix: (Mia and Maya's mother? Why would she bring her up now...?) Mia: Now then... Looks like we've gathered everything we could. All we have to do is win tomorrow! Everything will become apparent then. Phoenix: R-Right, Chief! We won't lose! To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet...

Adds statement \"I, like, didn't see anyone on the way to, like, the Channeling Chamber.\" It's not that important. Phoenix: ...Actually, I really have no idea!

Phoenix: May I ask you one more thing, Ms. Miney? Ini: Like, sure. Phoenix: Was there anything you found strange, unusual, or just out of place? Ini: Something out of place? Huh? Like, when do you mean? Phoenix: Uh, when...? Um... When you... were in the Side Room. Phoenix: I'm talking about when you were in the Side Room, of course! Ini: Um... Like, no, nothing strange.

Mia: Something you finally pull out of a witness is never a dead end, Phoenix.Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Phoenix: I've finally found the fault, or I guess in your case, the \"crack\" in your perfect lie. Ini: ... Phoenix: Take a look at this urn. Ini: Like, urn...? Phoenix: There are cracks. Do you see them? Ini: S-So? Like, what does that prove? von Karma: von Karma: Who cares about some worn-out old urn!? Ini: Like, yeah. I already, like, said I didn't see, like, anyone on the way to the Channeling Chamber. I didn't, like, totally say anything about, like, an urn, did I? Phoenix: It looks like you still don't understand. I propose that if you had really been walking along the Winding Way at that time, there was no way you could not have seen this person! Present Pearl Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'd like to introduce someone to you.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Oops, silly me. Slip of the finger. Judge: M-Mr. Wright. You need to keep control of that finger of yours. Phoenix: ...As I thought, this is the wrong piece of evidence. Oww! von Karma: An irresponsible lawyer has no place in this court! I suggest you go home! Phoenix: (Oww... So it's come down to a blunt \"go home\"...) Mia: Don't over-think this. All you need to do is remember what happened yesterday. Leads back to: \"I propose that if you had really been walking along the Winding Way at that time,\" Phoenix: I'd like to introduce someone to you. This is Ms. Morgan Fey's daughter, Pearl Fey. Judge: Y-Yes...? And how is this child relevant...? Phoenix: It just so happens that at the time of the murder, Pearl was playing in the center garden. Judge: Oh... Phoenix: And she just happened to break this urn. Judge: Oh... OHHH! von Karma: W-Wait! She... broke the urn...? Phoenix: Yup. She accidentally knocked it over with her ball! Ini: Nnaaawrr! Leads to: \"And Pearl was the one who put it back together...\"Present Pearl Fey profile Phoenix: Phoenix: You say that you didn't see anyone on the way to the Channeling Chamber... However, that is impossible! Ini: ...Like, what you do mean?... Phoenix: I'd like to introduce someone to you. This is Ms. Morgan Fey's daughter, Pearl Fey. von Karma: Interesting, you have a semi-intelligent look on your face. So? What about this child? Phoenix: It just so happens that at the time of the murder, Pearl was playing in the center garden. von Karma: The garden...? Phoenix: Yup! Which means anyone walking through the area would have to have seen her! So, Ms. Miney, what do you have to say to that!? Ini: Nnaaawrr! von Karma: von Karma: As the court can see... she's a bit of an airhead. Also, she was leading her \"sister\" at that time. Do you honestly think she would have noticed a simple child playing!? Preposteous! Phoenix: Phoenix: It's not preposterous, and I can prove it! von Karma: Wh-What sort of foolish... Phoenix: There is no way someone walking along the Winding Way could not have noticed Pearl! Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Leads to: \"This urn is my proof.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Oops, silly me. Slip of the finger. Judge: M-Mr. Wright. You need to keep control of that finger of yours. Phoenix: ...As I thought, this is the wrong piece of evidence. Oww! von Karma: An irresponsible lawyer has no place in this court! I suggest you go home! Phoenix: (Oww... So it's come down to a blunt \"go home\"...) Mia: Don't over-think this. All you need to do is remember what happened yesterday. Leads back to: \"There is no way someone walking along the Winding Way could not have noticed Pearl!\" Phoenix: This urn is my proof. von Karma: An old, cracked clay pot? What is that going to prove? Phoenix: Do you know why it's cracked? It's because Pearl broke it! That's why! Judge: She broke the urn...? Yeow! von Karma: Why... Why do I feel like you're about to ruin my beautiful day...? Phoenix: This urn was broken around the time the channeling started! Ini: Ah! Leads to: \"And Pearl was the one who put it back together...\"Phoenix: (No good. I can't find anything wrong...)Mia: Phoenix, the Judge believes this testimony. If you don't find some sort of hitch in her statement...Phoenix: He'll end the trial... I know...Mia: We have to give it another shot! It doesn't matter how many times we listen. We can't give up!Phoenix: And Pearl was the one who put it back together... ...while sitting right in the middle of the Winding Way!Ini: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?Phoenix: Ms. Miney.Ini: ...!Phoenix: Pearl was there, in the Winding Way at that time. She was hard at work, putting the pieces of the urn back together, you see. If you couldn't see that while you were walking, I'd have to declare you legally blind!Ini: G...Grrrrr...Phoenix: I think I have sufficiently proven one thing, Ms. Miney. You are a masterful liar!Ini: Arghnnn!Judge: Mr. Wright! You need to watch what you say!Phoenix: The one who needs to watch what she's saying is the witness! So, Ms. Miney! Tell us the truth!Ini: A-About what!?Phoenix: About what!? About where you really were at the time of the murder, of course!von Karma:von Karma: The witness just testified about that!Ini: Th-That's right! I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room...Phoenix: (...Can I really believe her? Was she really sleeping in the Side Room...!?)Yeah, I guess so. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess so. Sorry, my mistake. Judge: Very well. Now, then, let's proceed. Mia: Wait! Phoenix! Phoenix: Wh-What? Did I miss something again? Mia: You shouldn't let up on this line of questioning. Phoenix: Huh? Why not? Mia: Who is the only person you didn't see with your own eyes at the time of the murder? Phoenix: It was Ini Miney, correct? Mia: Which means, you can safely assume... She is the real murderer. Phoenix: That's a pretty daring assumption... Mia: But it's the most obvious, isn't it? I mean, is there anyone else? Phoenix: Well, no, I guess not. Mia: It's worth a shot, even if it's in the dark. So, let's try to prove that Ms. Miney was not in the Side Room at the time! Phoenix: (Umm, this is bluff number...? We've done this so many times in this case I've lost count.) Leads to: \"Your lies end here!\"There is no way! Leads to: \"Your lies end here!\"Phoenix: Your lies end here!Ini: Wh-What do you!?Phoenix: The witness says that during the actual murder, she was asleep in the Side Room. And I say that's not possible, because there is clearly a contradiction here!Judge: A contradiction...!? Where is this contradiction!?It's in her testimony just now. Leads to: \"Earlier in your testimony, Ms. Miney, you made the following statement.\"It's in the evidence. Phoenix: The answer is in the Court Record! Judge: Wh-What!? von Karma: Hmph. Planning to throw out another irrelevant piece of evidence? Judge: Very well. The court will see this evidence... Mia: Wait! Phoenix: M-Mia! Mia: I don't know what you plan on showing to the court, but I can guarantee you the answer is not there. Just this once, I'll lend you a hand. Now, rethink your answer. Phoenix: A-Alright... Judge: Mr. Wright. What is your answer? Phoenix: (Argh! OK, time to add another bluff to the pile...) Leads back to: \"The witness says that during the actual murder, she was asleep in the Side Room.\"Help me, Mia! Phoenix: (Hmm, I may have overreached on this one... Is there really a contradiction somewhere...?) Mia: Don't worry, you're on the right path, Phoenix. It might be a little hard for you to see the contradiction, but it's there. So, just this once, do you want me to help you out? Yes, please help me! Phoenix: Please, I need your help right now! Mia: H-Hold on... First, calm down, Phoenix. ...Good. ...That girl... She slipped up with her words. Phoenix: ...Her words? Mia: If she really was in the Side Room the entire time, then she just testified about something she shouldn't have any knowledge of. Phoenix: A-And what is that!? Mia: The rest is for you to figure out on your own. Judge: Mr. Wright. What is your answer? Phoenix: (Argh! OK, time to add another bluff to the pile...) Leads back to: \"The witness says that during the actual murder, she was asleep in the Side Room.\" No, I think I can do it. Phoenix: (Hmm, it's \"hard for me to see\"...? I can't just accept her help without thinking it through myself!) Mia: Ha ha, that's the spirit. Give it another try. Judge: Mr. Wright. What is your answer? Phoenix: (Argh! OK, time to add another bluff to the pile...) Leads back to: \"The witness says that during the actual murder, she was asleep in the Side Room.\"Phoenix: Earlier in your testimony, Ms. Miney, you made the following statement.Ini: And, like, Ms. Morgan was the only one in the Channeling Chamber, you know?Phoenix: It's true that at the time, both myself and Ms. Hart were not there. We had gone to call the police.Ini: ...S-So? Like, what does that, like, have to do with anything!?Phoenix: It's very simple. Ms. Miney, how did you know that fact?Ini: ...H-How...?Phoenix: I concede that Ms. Fey was the only person in the Channeling Chamber. However, someone who was \"asleep\" in the Side Room could not have known that!Ini: ...!Phoenix: Which means, Ms. Miney! You did, in fact, go to the Channeling Chamber. But you didn't go there by way of the Winding Way! (Changed from [However, you didn't go there by way of the Winding Way!] in the original release)Ini: Gwaaaaaaaaaaaa!Judge: B-But! Look at the manor guidemap! If one were to go between the Side Room and the Channeling Chamber, one would have to use the Winding Way!Phoenix: Yes, that's right, Your Honor. Which is why... Which is why I ask this very important question! Where was the witness at the time of the murder!?Ini: ...Umm... Urrrr...Phoenix: Ms. Miney! Please answer the question!von Karma:von Karma: ... Don't ask a question off of a baseless assumption, if you please...Phoenix: ...!von Karma: Well, I suppose since you've put it out on the table, Mr. Phoenix Wright... you might as well answer the question for us! Where was the witness at the time of the murder!?Mia: Now's your chance, Phoenix.Phoenix: Yeah!Mia: The only person who could have killed Dr. Grey was Ini Miney! So now is the time to prove it!Judge: Now, then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear your answer. Where was the witness when the murder took place?Present Channeling Chamber Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Miney was here, of course!\"Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: She was here... Mia: Phoenix! Did you turn the map upside down!? Phoenix: (...Oww... Sh-She slapped me on the wrist...) Mia: There is no way she could've committed the crime from there! Judge: *ahem* You two! Keep disrupting this court, and this trial is over. Is that clear!? Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor... Sorry... Leads back to: \"Now, then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear your answer.\"Phoenix: Ms. Miney was here, of course!Judge: Wha... But... But that's... the Channeling Chamber...von Karma: Isn't that the crime scene!?Phoenix: That's right! Ms. Miney was at the scene of the crime!Judge: Order! Order! Order! ...That's... Why, that is... Uwaah!von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright! Have you lost your mind!? Yesterday's testimony established that only the victim and the defendant were in the Chamber when the channeling started!Judge: Yes! Yes, that is correct! Please, explain yourself, Mr. Wright!Phoenix: Simple. Ms. Ini Miney was hiding at the scene of the crime.Ini: I... I was hiding!? Where!? Like, where was I hiding!?Present area behind folding screen Phoenix: Leads to: \"Here, of course.\"Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Miney was hiding here! Owww! von Karma: If you're going to tell a joke, at least make it one I'll laugh at. Ini: Hah! Go home, boy, and look up what \"hiding\" means! Phoenix: (Argh... Looks like I'm going to have to one up her!) Yeah, count on it! Mia: Phoenix, you can't lose your cool like this! ...And, grow up. Phoenix: Eh?... Oh, um, sorry, Chief... von Karma: You still haven't learned your lesson, have you, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Leads back to: \"Where!? Like, where was I hiding!?\"Phoenix: Here, of course.Judge: B-Behind the folding screen? Aah!von Karma: Don't make me say this again! Recall yesterday's testimony!Lotta: There ain't no way anyone was hangin' out behind that foldin' screen!Ini: See! You stupid jerk! Quit being so quick to pin it on me, slimeball!Judge: ...N-Now, now... Ms. Miney... One so young as you shouldn't be saying...Ini: Shut it, gramps. As if you know exactly how old I am!Judge: I-I'm sorry!Phoenix: (Looks like the pipe's about to burst... Guess I should help it along...) The witness was hiding behind the folding screen... With the help of this!Present Clothing Box Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Miney!\"Present anything else Phoenix: Ini: Yeah, you go ahead and use that to hide! von Karma: And you should hide in shame until you die! Phoenix: (What's with these two...? It's like they did a mind meld all of a sudden...) Mia: Don't let them affect you! Just think about the correct answer. Ini: What's wrong, boy!? Come on, say something, you loser! Leads back to: \"...N-Now, now... Ms. Miney... One so young as you shouldn't be saying...\"Phoenix: Ms. Miney! How you were able to hide at the scene of the crime is very simple! You were hiding inside this box!Ini: Aaah! Th-Th-That tiny little box!? No person could fit in that!Phoenix: Sorry, but your theory has already been disproved. (Lotta disproved you when she was hiding from me in it.)Ini: Umm...!von Karma:von Karma: But that clothing box was in the Side Room, right!? Which means it has nothing to do with the murder at all!Ini: Th-That's right! I was sleeping there, so I should know! That clothing box was there in the Side Room, the whole time!Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright. Do you think you can prove where the clothing box was at the time of the crime?No, I can't. Phoenix: Hmm... It's kind of hard to prove... Mia: ... Phoenix: Um... I guess by that look, there is a way to prove it? Mia: If you look in the Court Record. Phoenix: (Guess I should take a look at the Court Record...) Judge: Well, then. If there are... Phoenix: Phoenix: P-Please wait... I said it was hard, but I didn't say it was impossible to prove! Judge: Then stop puffing up your feathers and hurry up! Leads to: \"And now, I present the piece of evidence that will prove\"Yes, I can with some evidence. Leads to: \"And now, I present the piece of evidence that will prove\"Phoenix: And now, I present the piece of evidence that will prove this clothing box was at the scene of the crime when the murder took place!Present Folding Screen or Clothing Box Phoenix: Leads to: \"Take a look at this clothing box.\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: .............................. Phoenix: ...Um... Your Honor...? Judge: I... um, fell asleep... Mia: You got lucky, Phoenix! Now give it another shot! Phoenix: A-Alright... Leads back to: \"And now, I present the piece of evidence that will prove\"Phoenix: Take a look at this clothing box.Ini: You're soooo stupid. As if there's any sort of evidence in that old thing.Judge: ...! Th-This... What on earth...!? Mfph!von Karma: I don't have time for you to sit there surprised. Hurry up and say it already!Judge: Th-There's a hole! About 8 inches off the ground!Phoenix: Hmm, a hole about 8 inches off the ground. Where have we heard that before...?von Karma: ...The folding screen... It had a hole at the same height...Phoenix: That's right! I hope this has opened your eyes to what happened! At the time of the shooting, the clothing box was sitting behind the folding screen. Which is why the bullet from the pistol hit both the box and the folding screen! It went through the screen, and then into the box.Ini: ...Nnngh...!Phoenix: Ms. Miney! You were hiding behind the folding screen, waiting for your chance! Yes, for your chance to kill Dr. Grey!Ini: Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!Judge: Order! Order! ...So what you are saying--von Karma:von Karma: Th-Then... Mr. Phoenix Wright! What about this picture!? Are you saying that the person in this photo... is Ms. Ini Miney!?Phoenix: That is exactly what I am saying! Ms. Ini Miney! You were hiding inside this clothing box all along! And you wore a medium's costume to masquerade as Maya Fey!Judge: T-To masquerade as Maya Fey!?Phoenix: She had it planned from the very beginning! She would kill Dr. Grey, and pin the blame on my client!Ini: ...N...No... S-Stop...von Karma: ...I can't stand to listen to any more of this foolishness! If that's the case, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I have a proposition! This whole idea that the witness moved the clothing box to the crime scene, pretended to be the defendant, killed the victim, and then fled the scene of the crime; It's not possible for one person to do all that by herself!Correct. It's not possible. Leads to: \"It really is impossible.\"No, it is possible. Phoenix: I'm sure it's possible if you were to try! Ow! von Karma: I don't want to hear \"if\"! If you're going to give me \"if\", then give me some proof along with it. Where did Ini Miney get the costume then!? How about the wig!? Phoenix: Uh, I wasn't talking about that exact point... I meant, people, humans. If we want to do something bad enough, then... Judge: That's enough! Beyond simply proposing that it is possible for one person to commit this crime, it is the duty of a lawyer to back up his or her claims. Ini: Yeah, it's your duty! Judge: If you can't do that, then your proposal falls flat. Ini: Yeah, it totally falls flat! Phoenix: (...Why... Why do you have to hurt me so...?) Mia: It's alright, Phoenix. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: It isn't possible for one person to commit this crime, but... Phoenix: (... Ack! That's... That's right!) Leads to: \"It really is impossible.\"Phoenix: It really is impossible. For one person to do all the preparations, that is. Owww!von Karma: Need I remind you!? The foolish receive no mercy...Phoenix: W-Wait! Ms. von Karma... You said it was not possible for \"one person\", correct?von Karma: Wh--! Y-You can't be serious...Ini: ...*huff*...*huff*...Phoenix: Ms. Miney! You had an accomplice!Present Morgan Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Grr... This person...!\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: The accomplice was...?? Any thoughts, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: ... I don't even want to waste the energy to raise my whip. His lady friend can deal with him. Mia: Really, Phoenix! You even got Ms. von Karma to give up on you too! Phoenix: ...\"Too\"? Mia: As in, \"me too\". Phoenix: O-Oh... Okay, I'll think more carefully this time... Leads back to: \"Ms. Miney!\"Ini: ...Grr... This person...!Phoenix: If it wasn't someone from Kurain Village, you couldn't have gotten the costume. And if it wasn't someone from the Fey household, you wouldn't have that box to use.von Karma: Morgan... Fey!Judge: Isn't that the wonderful lady witness we had earlier!?Phoenix: What do you have to say to this, Ms. Miney!?Ini: ...Grrr... Grrrrrrrrrrr...Phoenix: You shot Dr. Grey with your own two hands! Do you deny it!?Ini: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!Phoenix: I think this is what really happened. The murderer had planted herself at the scene of the crime long beforehand. Dressed in a medium's costume and wearing a wig, she pretended to be the defendant. And then, the channeling started. The murderer crept silently towards the other two, both of whom had their eyes closed. ...First, she drugged Maya Fey with a strong sleeping agent. Then, she stabbed Dr. Grey with the knife! Next, she hid my client inside the clothing box... She did that so she could take Maya's place and frame her for the crime.Mia: ...But that's when something unexpected happened.Judge: Unexpected...?Phoenix: Yes.*bang!*Phoenix: Dr. Grey was actually not yet dead! With the last of his strength, he fired a shot at his attacker! And that is why the hole in the folding screen was so low to the ground! The murderer then took the gun from Dr. Grey, and...*bang!*Judge: After that, you and the other lady thought to break into the room...?Phoenix: Yes, a gunshot is certainly something you wouldn't expect to hear. Which is why, upon hearing the shots, we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber.*klik*Phoenix: Ms. Miney... She immediately covered her own costume with blood...*klik*Phoenix: And pretended to be Maya Fey.von Karma: B-But! That sort of deception would have been easy to see through!Phoenix: Which is precisely why Ms. Morgan Fey chased us out.Morgan: Please leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police! Hurry! Before there are more victims here!Judge: Wh-What is one supposed to say...?Phoenix: This is the real truth behind this murder....Ha... ...Ahahahaha...Judge: Wh-Who is that!? Laughing at a time like this...!? Ack!von Karma: Oh, you simpleminded fools. I'm sorry, are you still by chance, evolving?Phoenix: Wh-What is it this time...?Judge: M-Ms. von Karma... Surely...von Karma: Of course it was me! Do you really think someone of Von Karma blood would lose due to something this petty?Phoenix: WHAT IN THE WORLD!?von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright! Your argument is flawed in one very crucial area!Phoenix: And that is...?von Karma: If this witness is the real murderer... why would she go through all this trouble?Phoenix: ...Huh?von Karma: Working together with a medium, pretending to be one, putting on this whole act... What reason would she have to do such foolish things?Phoenix: Eh? Well, that's... Uh...Ini: Yeah, that's right! That's exactly what I was gonna say!von Karma: Oh, and one other thing. Why would Ms. Ini Miney want to kill Dr. Grey? Where is her motive?Ini: Yeah! That's exactly what I wanted to say too! Yeah! Motive! I don't have a motive!Phoenix: A... motive... That's... (I can't say she has no motive here! I have to think of a motive now! What is her reason for wanting Dr. Grey dead...?) The reason you wanted Dr. Grey dead is this!Present Newspaper Clipping 2 or Mimi Miney profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Hah!\"Present anything else Phoenix: Ini: Ho-hum, ho-hum... Is this a word search? I'm having a tough time finding the word \"motive!\" Judge: Uuugh... My breathing is becoming labored... Mia: My eyesight is failing me... von Karma: Makes you not want to get old, doesn't it, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (...Ack! I've got to take my time and think carefully about this...) Mia: Phoenix, think back! What kind of ax would Ini have to grind with Dr. Grey? ... There is only one reason, right? Phoenix: (...Only one...?) Leads back to: \"A... motive... That's... (I can't say she has no motive here!)\"Ini: ...Hah! Just as I thought. You bore me with your silly answers, Phoenix Wright!Phoenix: (Just great. Now even SHE is calling me by my full name...)Ini: You think I did this to get revenge for my sister's death?Phoenix: Yes! Because through that accident, you suffered a lot of hurt and pain yourself!Ini: Don't be stupid! No one has proof that Dr. Grey drugged my sister, right? And you want to say I wanted to take revenge based on nothing?Judge: Wh-What do you mean by that...?Ini: Senile, stupid gramps. ... I'm, like, going to explain, so, like, please listen, OK? It's been over half a year since I was discharged from the hospital. If I, like, wanted revenge, then, like, I wouldn't have waited this long. Um, and 'sides, like, the guy that thought of the spirit thing, was, like, Dr. Grey. It was, like, a total coincidence he asked me about it, you know?Phoenix: (She... She's back to her airhead persona...!) (Changed from [She... She's back to her airhead self...!] in the original release) H-However, you see-- Eeeowch!von Karma: Pathetic, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You failed to support your own theory. ...The end.Judge: I think we have our answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright. What Ms. Miney has stated is very true. The revenge plan is overly complicated, and she has no motive in the first place. Furthermore, there is no reason for Ms. Morgan Fey to cooperate with this plan.

Please, allow the defense one more minute.Judge: Alright.Mia: You can't lose here. Have faith in yourself, Phoenix!Phoenix: Mia...Mia: Yes, it does sound like a ridiculously messed up plan for a murder, but you know, regardless, that girl trained for this crime.Phoenix: ...R-Really?Mia: ... Listen, Phoenix. Everything happens for a reason. There is a reason for why she had to kill Dr. Grey. And it is also the reason she had no choice but to kill him in this fashion.Judge: Time is up, Mr. Wright. Your final answer, please. If you want to say that you can prove Ms. Miney had a motive, then... why did she kill the victim in this way? Can you provide the reason?Phoenix: (...Can I... Can I really do this...?)Yes, I can.

Only you can do this now!Phoenix: I will show and substantiate the fact that Ms. Miney had a motive!Ini: Ha ha ha. Too bad. You're too late! My cross-examination has already ended, after all.

There is no way Ini could've killed Dr. Grey by herself. And under the circumstances, there's no one else other than your aunt, Morgan.Maya: That... That's terrible... Why? Why would my aunt...?Everything is going just as I predicted, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix: Ack! Ms. von Karma!Maya: Why are you doing this!? Why are you trying to take revenge on Nick!? Nick had nothing to do with what happened to your dad.von Karma: Don't you have something better to be worrying about? Say, your own situation?Maya: Ugnn... ...Looking down on me, even though we're the same age...Phoenix: Are you done yet? You've caused me enough pain and suffering.von Karma: Not yet. My goal is to defeat you, and let the whole world know of your defeat.Phoenix: ...But even if you do that, it won't bring your father back...von Karma: ... Hmph. ...Whatever.

And that is the car accident one year ago. The motive I'm looking for must be there...) Ms. Miney. Please testify to this court about your car accident last year.Ini: Huh? I thought, like, you wanted to, like, ask about my, like, motive. I, like, don't see the point in, like, bringing up the past.Judge: Ms. Miney, if you please.Ini: ...OK, OK. Like, I totally don't think it'll do any good, but...Witness Testimony-- Last Year's Accident --Ini: That was... like, last year, in May. Like, something really bad had happened at, like, my sister's clinic around then... And like, the night of the accident, my sis was totally tired while she was driving. I was, like, totally pooped too, so I, like, fell asleep in the passenger's seat... I, like, woke up 'cause of a jolt, and, like, it was a sea of flames around me. I, like, opened the door and, like, got away.Judge: Hmm... I think I've heard of this incident.Phoenix: It was all the talk on the tabloid shows, day after day, last year.Judge: Yes, and there was talk about Dr. Grey... drugging your sister...? Gwuugh!von Karma: Those were merely \"rumors\". ...Totally baseless gossip.Judge: Hmm, yes... Mr. Wright, you may question the witness.Mia: Right now, it's impossible to prove that Dr. Grey did in fact drug Ms. Miney's sister.Phoenix: Yeah... Which means I'll have to work this from another angle.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Last Year's Accident --Ini: That was... like, last year, in May.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Didn't some sort of medical malpractice happen at your sister's hospital then...? Ini: Yeah, like, that was in May too. Like, the thing with all the patients dying was, like, May 2nd, and like, our accident was, like, on the 24th. Phoenix: Two accidents back to back... Do you assume it's just a coincidence? Ini: My sis was, like, totally tired, so that's why, duh.Ini: Like, something really bad had happened at, like, my sister's clinic around then...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That was the malpractice incident where 14 patients died, correct? Ini: Yeah. Phoenix: What was the cause of the mistake? Ini: Like, I heard it was 'cause the medicines, like, got mixed up. Phoenix: Was that the fault of your sister, Mimi Miney? Ini: Like, no way. Dr. Grey, like, wanted to blame it on my sis... von Karma: von Karma: That incident has nothing to do with our murder here. Besides, the police report has already documented that it was entirely Mimi Miney's fault. Phoenix: (Which means as far as the \"real\" facts are concerned... Mimi Miney is the one who made the mistake...) Ini: But, like, it really wasn't my sis...Ini: And like, the night of the accident, my sis was totally tired while she was driving.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She was \"totally tired\"? You mean, exhausted? Ini: Like, she had to talk to the police, and, like, was being investigated, like, every day. It was, like, a totally terrible situation. Phoenix: It's no wonder, then, that the car accident happened, huh? Press harder Phoenix: So then, why didn't you ask to switch places? Ini: Huh? Like, what are you talking about? Phoenix: I meant switch drivers. If your sister was so tired, then you should have switched with her. Judge: True, true. Ini: Ah, but like... I don't, like, have a driver's license... von Karma: This is news to me. I was not aware you didn't have your license, Ms. Miney. Judge: Hmm... Ms. Miney, please amend your testimony. Ini: Like, OK. Anyway... Adds statement \"I, like, didn't have my license, so, like, I couldn't take over driving for her.\" Leave her be Phoenix: (There's no point in asking her about her sister. I should be trying to find out more information about Ini!) Ini: So, like, can I go on? Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: Your sister... Mimi Miney, was she that exhausted? Ini: Like, she had to talk to the police, and, like, was being investigated, like, every day. It was, like, a totally terrible situation. Judge: Ah, if only you had your license and were able to drive for your sister. Ini: Y-Yeah... That was, like, too bad... von Karma: Now, then, witness. Continue with your testimony.Ini: I was, like, totally pooped too, so I, like, fell asleep in the passenger's seat...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The accident happened at night, correct...? Ini: Yeah, like, it was at, like, 1 AM or so, I think. I had, like, a paper due, like, really soon... so, like, I hadn't slept and was working, like, real hard. von Karma: So it was because the two of you were so tired that this accident happened.Ini: I, like, woke up 'cause of a jolt, and, like, it was a sea of flames around me.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And your sister? What happened to her? Ini: I... I didn't see her... The car was, like, totally black, and there was, like, a ton of smoke... I, like, totally had, like, no clue what was going on.Ini: I, like, opened the door and, like, got away.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Please tell us about your escape in more detail. Ini: I... I, like, kept wanting to forget that time, so, like, I don't remember things about the accident in, like, details anymore... Judge: Hmm, well, it's alright. No need to push yourself. Ini: I think I, like, gave an interview after the accident. Like, that would probably be the most accurate, you know?

    "cot": "Evidence 6, Newspaper Clipping 2, states that Mimi Miney died in a car accident as a result of falling asleep at the wheel. Ini Miney's Testimony 3, however, says: \"And like, the night of the accident, my sis was totally tired while she was driving.\" Then Testimony 6 says: \"I, like, didn't have my license, so, like, I couldn't take over driving for her.\"\n\nThe contradiction arises because Ini claims she did not have a license and thus would have been unable to take over driving, yet Mimi was driving tired, which implies Ini was the passenger. There is no explicit contradiction here, however.\n\nLooking further: Testimony 3 and Testimony 6 are consistent with the description in Evidence 6.\n\nNow focusing on Testimony 1: \"Like, something really bad had happened at, like, my sister's clinic around then...\"\n\nEvidence 3 states that on May 2nd, 14 patients died due to malpractice at Grey Surgical Clinic.\n\nNo contradiction.\n\nTestimony 2 states: \"And like, the night of the accident, my sis was totally tired while she was driving.\"\n\nThe contradiction may be with Evidence 6 \"Ms. Ini Miney Holds Interview About Crash - According to this, Miss Ini was in the passenger's seat. And dozing...

Yet in testimony 6 she claims she didn't have one.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 18 (License Photo) and Testimony 6 (Ini claims no license).\n",

Phoenix: It's not your fault. You didn't do it. Maya: No, I... I did it... I killed that person. Phoenix: But that wasn't you. Maya: It doesn't matter. It might as well have been me. Phoenix: (I can't believe something like this happened...The events of that gloomy, rainy afternoon that started this whole mess...keep playing through my mind...) Episode 2Reunion, and Turnabout June 16, 3:34 PMWright & Co. Law Offices ???: What depressing rain... Do you understand how depressed that makes me!? Do you!? Phoenix: Uh, I guess... ???: But actually, more than being depressed, I'm angry. Angry at that weather girl on TV. \"I think our little rainy spell will take a break with a day of sun!\"...is what that girl said! I'd stake my life on it! Phoenix: Well, it's the weather... ???: But that's why I didn't bother to bring an umbrella today. What nerve, calling herself a weather girl! She's going to hear about my $1500 suit! Phoenix: Um... About your case... Unless you're planning on suing the weather girl...? ???: ... I'm sorry. I thought that before we got down to business, we could have some friendly chatter. My name is Dr. Turner Grey. I'm a surgeon. Phoenix: (Remind me never to end up under his knife...) Grey: I'm here today because of this incident. Phoenix: \"Malpractice at Grey Surgical Clinic. Fourteen In-Patients Lose Their Lives!\" ...Oh. You're... the doctor at...? Grey: It's really quite upsetting. Did you hear me!? UPSETTING! Phoenix: Yes, yes, I heard you. I agree, it's quite upsetting, Dr. Grey. Grey: The one that screwed up was that nurse! It was her that got the medications mixed up and killed those 14 patients! And yet! Now listen good! And yet! That nurse had the nerve to go and die before admitting to her wrongdoing! She didn't even offer any sort of explanation to me! And this is the kicker! She up and has herself a grand ol' accident and crashed her car! Smash! Crunch! Instantly transforming her car into the accordion model! Phoenix: (That's right... About a year ago, all the tabloid shows were talking about it. Fourteen victims of medical malpractice and the nurse's mysterious fatal accident. There were rumors that Dr. Grey had actually caused that crash. People said it was to forever hide the person responsible for the malpractice incident.) Grey: Why would I...? Now, I'm just going to say this once -- Why on Earth would I want to kill that nurse? She's the one who killed those 14 patients! Not me! Phoenix: I think you need to take a deep breath, doctor, and focus... More to the point, this case is over a year old. Why bring it up now...? Grey: That's simple! Because the situation is slipping out of my grasp. This just won't do. My clinic isn't seeing nearly as many patients nowadays. Do you understand what that means!? It means they're not coming to my clinic! Phoenix: (You don't say...? If it were me, I don't think I'd want to go either.) So... what would you like me to do about it...? Grey: I want you to help me prove I'm innocent. Phoenix: Um, you do realize I'm a lawyer, not a private investigator, right? Grey: No, this is something only you can do. Phoenix: ...? Grey: Maya Fey. You know this girl, correct? Phoenix: ...! (Maya! Why would he know her name...!?) Grey: I heard you were working under her for a little while. Phoenix: Well, yes... I mean... Hey, wait a second here! I worked UNDER her!? Grey: Yes. Am I wrong? She told me, so I'm not quite sure if... Phoenix: Well, we worked a few trials together. But she went back to her hometown to undergo more training. Grey: Ah, yes, I heard. It must be lonely for you. Phoenix: Wh-What!? Wait... I'm not...! Grey: She must be an extraordinary girl to handle such rigid training. Phoenix: Huh? Grey: I have an acquaintance who knows a lot about these mystical sorts of things. She's the one who introduced me to Ms. Fey. Phoenix: (Is Maya... really that famous...?) Grey: And I've already set up an appointment. Phoenix: For what? Grey: What else!? A channeling! I'm going to have her call the spirit of that nurse that went and got herself killed! Phoenix: O-Oh. (Maya... I wonder what she's up to right now...) Maya: We, the women of the Fey clan have always been spirit mediums. (Changed from [We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums.] in the original release) It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us. Phoenix: (That's what she told me... I guess she's learned to accept her responsibilities and become an adult...) Grey: Not counting training, this will be her first time channeling a spirit, so she gave me one condition before accepting my request. Phoenix: A condition...? Grey: The condition is you, Mr. Wright. She said that she wouldn't do the channeling without first seeing you again. Phoenix: Me...? Grey: And that is why I've searched you out! You want to see her too, don't you!? Phoenix: (And so... that is how I ended up visiting Maya's hometown with the doctor...) June 19, 1:25 PMKurain Village Phoenix: (So this is Kurain Village; Maya's hometown.) ???: ... Phoenix: W-Why, hello there. ???: ... Phoenix: Hmm... What an odd little girl. ???: Hey! Wait up, Pearly!! Phoenix: (Hm? Someone else is coming this way...) ???: Niiiiiiiick! Phoenix: M-Maya. How are you...? It's good to see you again. Maya: Wow, I didn't think you'd really show up! Phoenix: It's not that big a deal. You made it sound like you were soooo far away. Maya: Well, maybe I exaggerated... just a little. Phoenix: It was only 2 hours by train. If I had known you were this close, I'd have visited more. Maya: No! You're not allowed. I already decided, you know. Until I become an adult, I have to work hard and be strong by myself... Phoenix: Oh... well... Anyway, congratulations. I'm glad to hear training is going well for you. Maya: Heh, heh... Examine Phone booth Phoenix: It's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. My cell phone doesn't get reception up here, so who knows. I may need it later. Bus shelter Phoenix: An old bus stop. It says \"Kurain Village\" on the sign post. The buses seem incredibly inconvenient since they only come 3 times a day. Giant rock Phoenix: A giant rock that seems to be reaching for the sky. Its origins are written on a beat-up, old sign. It looks like this giant rock is called the \"Kurain Boulder\". There's a really complex explanation written here, but long story short, it's a big stone for spirits to live in... Or something like that... Road and houses further Phoenix: Rustic, thatch-roofed houses where the other villagers live line the street. They're nowhere near as large or as nice as the manor in front of me. It's kind of odd that I don't see any of the other villagers walking around, though... Fey Manor Phoenix: The biggest, most elegant of the buildings I can see from here. This is Fey Manor; the place Maya calls home. It's easy to be overwhelmed by its presence... Talk Today's channeling Phoenix: Looks like you've finally become a full-fledged medium, taking on your first job. Maya: Yeah. I didn't think it would be this soon. Phoenix: But this case... Do you know the messy story behind it...? Maya: Ha ha ha, behold the power of the Maya Intelligence Network! Let's see. Fourteen people died because of malpractice on Dr. Grey's part, right? And to pin the blame on the nurse, he killed her in what appeared to be a car accident! Phoenix: Huh? Um, so what is this \"Maya Intelligence Network\" anyway...? Maya: The tabloids. Phoenix: That's what I thought. Maya: ... Ha ha ha. I'm just pulling your leg, Nick! What really happened is the exact opposite. I heard all about it from Dr. Grey. Phoenix: ... Maya: Oh, come on, Nick! I wouldn't take a crazed killer as a client! That's too scary, even for me. Phoenix: (Y-Yeah, I guess so.) Kurain Village Phoenix: So this is your hometown, huh, Maya? Maya: Yup! Kurain Village... But I've heard people call this place \"Medium Valley\", too. Phoenix: Interesting... So everyone that lives here is a spirit medium? Maya: Pretty much. Most of my ancestors were too, I think... Phoenix: (That's probably true since the Fey ability to communicate with the dead is so strong...) Maya: Actually, only the women of this village are mediums. Phoenix: So what do the men do? Maya: They usually work someplace outside the village. The girl earlier Phoenix: Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you about that girl I saw earlier. Do you know her? Maya: Oh, you mean Pearly? Phoenix: Pearly? Maya: Pearl Fey. She's my cousin. Isn't she adorable? Just like yours truly! Phoenix: Cousin... Wait, then that means... Is she also a...? Maya: Yup. She's a medium, too. Pearly's a real genius when it comes to channeling! Phoenix: Hmm, I see. I hope I didn't scare her when I tried to talk to her earlier. Maya: Nah, it's not you. My aunt drilled it into her head that \"if a suspicious-looking person tries to talk to you, run away\". Phoenix: S-Suspicious-looking...!? Maya: Well, you're not wearing training clothes, for starters... Phoenix: Of course not. Maya: Pearly is my aunt's most valued treasure, so she's not allowed to go outside of town. She doesn't know much about the world outside of Kurain Village. Phoenix: Aunt? Maya: Pearly's mother is my aunt, duh. Come on, Nick. Present Attorney's Badge Maya: Ah, it's good to see this tarnished badge again. Phoenix: What do you mean by \"tarnished\"...? Maya: Well, look. This badge is like every other. It's bound to lose its color and shine after years and years. But you know, polishing it up once in a while wouldn't be a bad idea. Maya Fey profile Maya: Ha ha ha. I'm warning you! I'm not the same weak Maya you knew a year ago, Nick! Phoenix: You seem to have a lot of faith in yourself. Maya: You'll see soon enough. I think you'll be totally shocked by how good my hamburgers are now! Phoenix: (Were you training to be a medium or a cook?) Turner Grey profile Maya: Hey, it's my client! Phoenix: \"Client,\" huh? You're really serious about your work, aren't you? Maya: I thought I'd say it once, just to try it out, like how you always say, \"My client.\" Any other evidence Maya: Hmm, nothing really comes to mind, Nick. Phoenix: Don't say that with such a big smile on your face. Maya: Ha ha. What can I say? I'm in a good mood today. Any other profile Phoenix: What do you think about this person? Maya: Hey, have I told you this one yet, Nick? We have a legend in this village. It goes like this. \"All the woman of the Fey clan are beauties.\" Well? Phoenix: ...And that's a legend now? After clearing all Talk options: Maya: Well, Nick, I've got to get going. It's about time for the channeling to start. Phoenix: Huh? Oh, yeah... Maya: I'm doing the channeling in my house, so come on in, OK? After I'm done, we can grill up some juicy burgers! Phoenix: Alright. Good luck, Maya. Maya: Thanks! Phoenix: (Well... At least she's still the same perky Maya.) June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Grey: Ah, Mr. Wright. I'm so glad you showed. Phoenix: Some nice weather we're having today. Aren't you happy? Grey: No, not at all. That stupid weather girl made the wrong call again. \"It will rain cats and dogs today!\" she said with a straight face. I can't believe they allow such misguided reports on the public airwaves! Phoenix: (Looks like talking about the weather with this guy is just asking for punishment...) Grey: ...But anyway, this is a splendid manor. Phoenix: (No argument there... It's hard to believe that this is Maya's house, though...) Grey: I was given a guidemap to this building. Here, Mr. Wright. I have a copy for you too. Guidemap added to the Court Record. Examine Door Phoenix: A door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. It looks like there is a strong lock on this door to top it off. Writing on top of the door Phoenix: Someone with a lot of skill wrote these four Chinese characters with a brush. Oh look, here's a translation: \"Once in a Lifetime.\" Its message is people should value their ghostly meetings as once in a lifetime chances. Blue board Phoenix: A piece of cloth with a ton of finely-written characters jammed onto it. Probably esoteric knowledge only mediums should know. ...Hmm, let's see... Here's one in English... It says... \"100 Ways to Save Money\". ... Being a medium sounds like a rough way of life... Door to the Winding Way Phoenix: This door leads out to the Winding Way. The weather outside looks really nice. Talk Today's channeling Phoenix: What are you going to do once the nurse's spirit has been called? Grey: Isn't it obvious? I'm going to have her write a signed confession. Phoenix: A signed confession? Grey: Yes, a confession. Pay attention! I'll have her write this: \"One year ago, on May 2nd, 14 patients died due to my negligence. And then, on May 24th, I fell asleep at the wheel and died in a car accident due to my further negligence. I'm sorry and I apologize for being negligent.\" That's what I'll have her write! With a confession, the rain falling on my soul can finally stop. Phoenix: O-Oh, I see... Maya Phoenix: So, how did you hear about Maya Fey...? Grey: I heard about her from an acquaintance; a girl studying the occult at the college. That girl introduced me to this village. This is the home of the Kurain School of Channeling. Phoenix: The home, huh...? Grey: And Ms. Maya is a daughter of the \"Master\", I hear. Phoenix: Master...? Grey: Anyway, do you see that door? That's the room where people and spirits meet. Ms. Maya's aunt is in there right now. Would you care to meet her...? Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Look, here's my attorney's badge. Grey: Are you trying to compete with me and my profession with that piece of scrap? Phoenix: ...Uh... Grey: I am a surgeon. Compared to you lawyers, I'm practically a saint! Yes, well, I don't exactly have any patients right now, but, and listen good! I'm not the one that made the mistake! Phoenix: (This doctor needs his head examined...) Guidemap (Fey Manor) Phoenix: Wow, this manor is really nice, don't you think? Grey: Do you honestly think this place is all that impressive? Don't make me laugh. Phoenix: Huh? Grey: This is the countryside. Land here is dirt cheap. I will have something much greater one day! I will build my own grand mansion! Did you hear me!? A grand MANSION! This manor will seem like nothing! Phoenix: (Uh, could you keep that shaking fist away from my face? Thanks...) Maya Fey profile Grey: She's still young, but one day, she'll bear a big responsibility. She'll be the Master, you know. The MASTER! Phoenix: (I guess there are \"Master\" mediums, too...) Morgan Fey profile Grey: That's Ms. Maya's aunt. Earlier, she made me eat some sort of traditional dessert the size of a tea saucer! Hmm, I wonder if Ms. Morgan ever performs channelings herself...? Any other profile Phoenix: What do you have to say about this person, Dr. Grey? Grey: ...This person... Hmm... Judging by their face... Phoenix: W-What is it? Grey: They have a weak stomach. Phoenix: R-Really... June 19Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: (Wow... It's such a strange atmosphere in here... These flickering lights... I guess they're candles...) ???: Good sir! Who might you be...? Phoenix: Aaah! I-I'm, uh, my name is Phoenix Wright... ???: Oh... You must be that good sir... Phoenix: (\"Good sir\"...? Is she talking about me?) ???: You are a lawyer, are you not, good sir? I have heard much about you from Mystic Maya. Phoenix: Is that so? (\"Mystic\" Maya...?) ???: I am Mystic Maya's aunt, Morgan Fey. Phoenix: N-Nice to meet you. Morgan: Ah, I had wanted to speak with you about a certain incident, good sir. It would seem that perhaps you ask too much of Mystic Maya in performing your duties. Most unbecoming, I'm afraid. Phoenix: Huh? Morgan: Don't tell me you have already forgotten? That was it not for Mystic Maya and her assistance, you would surely not have won... Phoenix: (First a girl that runs away, and now an old lady who says I stink at doing my job... When did I become the poster boy for \"How Not to Make a First Impression\"...?) Morgan: The past is the past though. Let us speak of the present now. Phoenix: ...Ah, thank you... Examine Door Phoenix: The Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. There is a giant iron lock where the handle is. It feels like a curtain that separates the normal world from the spirit one. Floor panels on left Phoenix: This is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air. Altar Phoenix: I guess this is an altar. Whatever it is, it feels very important. (Changed from [I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important.] in the original release) A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement. Morgan: Good sir! I wonder if you would please not touch the sacred objects. Those objects are being offered to the spirits. If you were to touch them, good sir, they would become cursed. Yes, cursed. Phoenix: (She really didn't have to talk down to me. I'm not that much of an idiot...) Folding screen Phoenix: This folding screen is really showing its age. All of its edges are a bit tattered. The lettering is fading too. I think I recognize a few of the characters on here... ...Ku ...ra ...in... I'm pretty sure that's what it says... Maybe I'll ask Maya about it later... Space behind folding screen Phoenix: There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. Talk Maya Phoenix: So why do you add \"Mystic\" to Maya's name. Isn't that a little... strange? Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Yes! Morgan: How dare you be so rude and disrespectful towards Mystic Maya! Phoenix: I-I'm sorry. Morgan: She must be addressed by her proper title, good sir. You must call her \"Mystic Maya\"! Phoenix: Um, uh... So, about Mystic Maya... Uh... Morgan: It is the blood. Phoenix: Excuse me? \"Blood\"? Morgan: Mystic Maya carries the blood of the Master. In actuality, she is the only one remaining. Phoenix: (Only one remaining...? What's that supposed to mean?) Morgan: Mystic Maya is the last of the rightful heirs of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Phoenix: OK... Then... where do you stand...? Morgan: That is a little more complicated... Although a woman of the Fey family, I am merely a member of the branch family. Phoenix: ...Branch family? What's that? Morgan: It is as it sounds. For a member of the branch family, no matter her spiritual power, she can never become the Master of the Kurain School. Phoenix: So... how strong are you...? Morgan: ... It is a shame, however I will admit. I can not even begin to compare the lowliness of my power to the Master's. Phoenix: (So that's how it is...) Today's channeling Phoenix: So today's channeling will be her first? Morgan: Yes, good sir. Because the spirit of a person who dies in a traffic accident is usually very strong, it is usually easier to call that person to our world. Phoenix: (\"Traffic accident\" indeed.) Morgan: The channeling will take place here, in this Channeling Chamber, good sir. As you can see, I am in the process of preparing. Channeling Chamber Phoenix: So... this room is the... Channeling Chamber...? Morgan: The place where a spirit medium speaks with those who have departed. Phoenix: I don't suppose you'd mind if we observed the session... Morgan: Do not even think of such nonsense! Only the medium and the client may enter here. Phoenix: O-Oh. Morgan: The secrets of the Kurain Techniques can not be seen by just anybody. Phoenix: (That never stopped Maya from doing it in front of me before...) Morgan: It is also for your safety, good sir, if something were to go wrong. That is why, while channeling is being performed, that heavy door is securely locked... Phoenix: Oh, that's what the lock is for... Present Maya Fey profile Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Y-Yes! Morgan: When did you... take a hidden picture of Mystic Maya!? Phoenix: Wh-Wh-What!? Wait... It's not like that at all! Morgan: It is unforgivable! Phoenix: Ow-ow-ow! (Why did she slap me?) Turner Grey profile Phoenix: About this person... Morgan: Oh! It is that man, is it not? A man who wishes to borrow a departed spirit's power to hide the lack of his own. What an insignificant man. Phoenix: Insignificant...? Morgan: That would mean you are that man's insignificant little friend, dear sir. Phoenix: (Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?) Anything else Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Ack! Morgan: We would like to begin the channeling at 3 o'clock. If you don't mind, good sir, would you mind allowing me to make preparations? Phoenix: Uh, um, sure... go ahead... (She's a Fey alright! Just as odd as the rest.) After clearing all Talk options: Morgan: ... Oh, yes. I wonder if you have yet to meet Pearl, good sir. Phoenix: Pearl? Morgan: She is an adorable, angelic young girl. Phoenix: Oh, that odd... Morgan: She is my daughter. Now then, what was it you were about to say...? Phoenix: Wh-What a cute daughter you have... Ahaha... Morgan: A pure heart that knows not of the evils in this world is a powerful thing, good sir. Please refrain from affiliating with her, I request. Phoenix: (Well, it's not like I had the chance to anyway...) Morgan: I must insist and stress that you not let it occur. Phoenix: Okay, okay, I get it! June 19Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Wow. This garden is really breath-taking. Someone put a lot of love into it. What is that over there...? ...Is that an incinerator? It looks a little out of place in a garden like this...) Examine Garden Phoenix: A splendid garden with a small lamp and traditional decorations. It's a bit small to walk around in... Although, that incinerator piques my curiosity... Incinerator Phoenix: It's a small incinerator. I don't think garbage trucks come all the way out here to a little village like this. So every family has to burn their own trash. Side room Phoenix: It looks like there's a room over there, too. A peaceful feeling is emanating from it. Urn Phoenix: It's a really old urn. The ashes of a person long dead are inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on. June 19Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: (So this is... the Side Room. Looks like it's more of a break room. There is bedding spread out on the floor. It looks like someone's sleeping in one. I shouldn't disturb them...) Examine Wooden bear sculpture Phoenix: It's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. \"Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling\" What the!? It's a souvenir. So does this mean it's easy to spot bears here... And for them to spot you...? *gulp* Alcove Phoenix: It's a small alcove. I have no idea what it's supposed to mean or symbolize. If I had one of these in the office, it would end up as storage space. But here, it's decorated with some pretty flowers and a beautiful hanging scroll. Sliding door Phoenix: This is the first time I've seen a sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard. Bed on right Phoenix: There's bedding spread out on the floor. Is that someone sleeping in one over there? She's probably an exhausted medium taking a break and catching some z's. If I wake her up, she might be grumpy and throw a spell on me. It's probably a good idea to not disturb her sleep... Winding Way (after visiting Side Room and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber) ???: Hey! You! Hold on, now! This gal's got a few questions to ask! Phoenix: (Hmm... I'm sure I've heard that southern accent somewhere before...) ???: Oh, well I'll be! It's Mr. Phoenix Wright! How ya been!? Haven't seen you in, what, a year!? Phoenix: Um... You... are... uh... Lotta Hair Phoenix: Um, Lotta Hair, was it? ???: L-L-Lotta Who!? Wait, you best not be making fun of my hair, now! Phoenix: Ah, no, um, I wasn't \"making fun\"... I was \"complimenting\" you on your fine hair... ???: Hmph, I dare say yer one heartless man, Mr. Wright. It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty. But looks like you already forgot that. Phoenix: Hold up... you were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak... ???: Minor detail. Stop being so uptight; lettin' little things get in the way. The name's Hart. Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it! Phoenix: Oh yeah! That's it! Lotta: Now listen here. I'm here to take some pictures today. Gonna get myself a real scoop. Phoenix: Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean. Lotta: You betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous \"paranormal photographer\"!? Leads to: \"Oh, that's right!\" Lotta Hart Phoenix: You're Lotta Hart, right...? Lotta: Bingo! I'm the one and only \"paranormal photographer\", Lotta Hart! Phoenix: Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean. Lotta: Of course! And today, I'm gonna get myself a real scoop! You wait and see! Leads to: \"Oh, that's right!\" Who are you again? Phoenix: Sorry, but who are you again? ???: Oh Lawdy! I've met some cold men in my days, but you... You're in an icebox of yer own! Phoenix: Come on, am I really that bad...? ???: Put yer noggin to some use! You've gotta remember who I am! It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty. Phoenix: Ah! You're the one from that trial! ???: See, I knew you could remember if you tried! Phoenix: You were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak... ???: Why don't we let bygones be bygones, now. It's yesterday's news, right? Name's Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it, ya hear!? Phoenix: Um... So what brings you here today? Lotta: Hah! You should already know! I'm here for the big scoop! I can feel it! Phoenix: Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean. Lotta: You betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous \"paranormal photographer\"!? Leads to: \"Oh, that's right!\" Lotta: Oh, that's right! This ain't no time to be wastin' time! The channeling's about to get started! Phoenix: Is it that time already!? Lotta: We all should hurry up and get to the Meditation Room. ...What are you waiting around for!? Come on! Phoenix: (Lotta Hart, huh? I've been judging her harshly because of that case, but, I guess looking back, we had some good times, too...) June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Morgan: We will now begin the channeling. Mystic Maya and honored guest, please proceed into the Channeling Chamber. Grey: With this, I can finally swat all those pesky flies, once and for all! You hear me!? They won't be able to say a single bad thing about me after this! You would love to hear them apologize, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Me!? Oh, uh, yeah, I sure would. Morgan: Mystic Maya, do you have the Channeling Chamber key? Maya: Yup, right here. Morgan: That is most satisfactory. That key is one-of-a-kind, so please take care of it well. Maya: It'll be fine, Aunt Morgan. I won't lose it, trust me! OK, Dr. Grey. Let's get started. Grey: Finally! Let's go! *click* Morgan: Now let us wait patiently out here for them. Please have some lovely bitter green tea and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts... Lotta: Hold on, now, granny! Morgan: ...Granny? Lotta: How come we ain't allowed in that room!? Morgan: Dear madam, you have an \"impressive\" grasp of English. From where did you learn it? Lotta: What!? I'm from the heart of the heartland! Morgan: Is that so? Then I humbly request that you return to this \"Heart of the Heartland\". Lotta: Wh-What are ya...? Morgan: This is Kurain Village. If you can not follow our traditions and rules, we request that you leave! Lotta: ...! ... Sorry. Phoenix: (Wow. She shut Lotta up! Now THAT's impressive!) Morgan: Now then, let us wait. *BANG* Lotta: Hey now! Wh-What was that just now!? Phoenix: (It came from inside the Channeling Chamber...) *BANG* Lotta: Hey! Th-That's a gunshot! Morgan: E-Excuse me!? Lotta: I've heard that sound before. It's a gunshot! I'd bet my afro on it! Phoenix: (M-Maya! Maya's in there!) Break into the Chamber Lotta: Well, Mister Lawyer! What's the plan!? Phoenix: What else!? We're going to break in! Lotta: What!? But... But there's only one key and that kid's got it. Phoenix: We're going to have to break the door. Is that alright, Ms. Fey? Morgan: Well, yes... But there is one matter... That is... Phoenix: Don't try to stop me! You can send the repair bill to the Wright & Co. Law Offices later! Leads to: \"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\" Ask Morgan what to do Phoenix: Ms. Fey! What should we do!? Lotta: Yellow-bellied chicken liver! What are ya waiting for!? Kick it down already! Phoenix: But... The key... Morgan: That key is one-of-a-kind. In this world, there is only that one. Even I am powerless to open that door. Phoenix: (Hmm, there is really no other way...) Alright. Stand aside! I'm going to break the door down! Morgan: W-Wait! Please! That sort of recklessness... Leads to: \"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\" Lotta: Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man! *SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!* Phoenix: D-Dr. Grey!! *klik* ???: ...I... ...I was... murdered... Phoenix: M-Maya? ???: That man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him... Phoenix: Wh-What!? *klik* Phoenix: Lotta! At a time like this!? Lotta: Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!? Step away from there! Morgan: Please leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police! Phoenix: But, but... Morgan: Hurry! Before there are more victims here! Lotta: Hey, let's go, City Boy! Leave this to the granny! June 19Kurain Village Phoenix: (My cell phone doesn't get reception way out here... So I ended up using the phone booth to call the police...) Lotta: And...? Phoenix: They're on their way. Lotta: That's good. Lawdy, I saw a genuine \"mysterious phenomenon\"... Phoenix: (She seems really on edge because of all this... Not that I blame her... I'm scared to death by what's going on...) Talk What you witnessed Lotta: Hey, Mister. That gal... Maya. She wasn't the one that pulled the trigger, was she...? Phoenix: (Oh, yeah... Lotta doesn't know that when Maya is channeling, her whole physical appearance changes.) Lotta: Then again... Weren't there only the two of 'em in there? I reckon she musta done it then... Dr. Grey Phoenix: Lotta, what do you know about Dr. Grey? Lotta: Not much, but I did some digging... That's one gent with a bad reputation. Phoenix: Really? Lotta: I hear he's good at surgery and stuff, but his personality stinks like wet sheep. Phoenix: (I sort of got the same impression myself...) Lotta: He's real controllin'. Soon as his nurse or patients don't do what he says, he starts a-hollerin'. Musta been real rough to work for him. Present Anything Lotta: Hey, they'll be here soon, right? The police, I mean. I reckon you should be gettin' back to the crime scene, now. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess so...) June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Morgan: Ah, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Ms. Fey! How's, um... Mystic... Maya? Morgan: She has returned to \"this world\". The Spirit Severing Technique was successful. Phoenix: Let me see her, please! Morgan: She is still unconscious. I humbly request that you wait outside for her recovery. Phoenix: (Guess I just have to wait... *sigh*) Gumshoe: The police are here! Sorry to keep you waiting! Huh? ...You again!? Phoenix: What are you doing all the way out here, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: It's actually kinda funny. I was in the area for a business trip, pal. Well, time to check out the crime scene. I'll have to question everyone here later on, so just sit tight, alright? Phoenix: (Why is he grinning at me...?) Morgan: Shall I show you to the scene of the crime, Detective Gymshoe? Gumshoe: Um... My name isn't Gymshoe... Phoenix: (The two of them went into the Channeling Chamber... I guess all I can do for now is see what everyone else has to say...) June 19Kurain Village Lotta: ... Phoenix: (She's probably scared out of her wits after having a murder take place right near her.) Lotta? Lotta: GAWDDON'TLETITBEMENEXT! Phoenix: Eek! Don't scare me like that! Lotta: What do you mean!? Yer the one scaring me! If I weren't so tough, you'd have another dead body on yer hands -- mine! Talk Any ideas Leads to: \"Did you see or notice anything that stuck out at you?\" Present Maya Fey profile Lotta: Must be an awful thing to see each other again and have this happen. Never woulda guessed that gal would end up being a murderer. Phoenix: That wasn't Maya! She was being controlled by a spirit... Lotta: Come on, now, City Boy. Ya really think the cops'll believe that? Turner Grey profile Lotta: Hey, it's that Dr. Grey guy. Pity what happened to him. Pretty scary what ghouls and ghosts can do to a man, huh? Gawd rest his poor soul. Phoenix: (Hmm... Since when was Lotta so religious...?) Morgan Fey profile Lotta: That old lady sure can be forceful. She scared me back there. ...Well, only a little, now, ya hear? Dick Gumshoe profile Lotta: I swear I've seen his face before. Maybe during that last case... Whenever something happens, this detective guy is always there. I wonder if he's the real baddie behind everything? Phoenix: (Somehow, I highly doubt it...) Anything else Lotta: Nope. Don't know nothin' about that. Things that don't catch my eye, don't catch my interest. Phoenix: (And she calls herself a journalist??) Phoenix: Did you see or notice anything that stuck out at you? Lotta: Nah... Well, maybe one thing... Phoenix: What is it!? Lotta: Turns out my poor stomach's not good at handlin' this kind of thing. Phoenix: Huh-what? Lotta: Curses and ghosts and stuff comin' back to get ya... This is just too much, I say. Phoenix: What is too much? Lotta: Being an occult photographer. That's some scary stuff, so I think I'm gonna try being a celebrity photographer, now. Phoenix: Going after photos more within your reach from now on? More glamour, less gore? Lotta: ... Phoenix: What's up? Lotta: Oh, yeah! Phoenix: Wh-What is it? Lotta: I took some hot pictures earlier! Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: Remember!? I took some pictures at the murder scene inside! Phoenix: (Ack! She did! Two even!) Lotta: \"The Séance Murder\"... I sure like the ring of that. It'll be a sensational story! Phoenix: L-Lotta! Lotta: Sorry, but my journalistic sense is burnin' inside me! Hate to cut and run, but I'm headin' back in! Gotta beat those cops to the scoop of the century! UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhahahahahahahahahahaha... ... Phoenix: (I don't know who's scarier... Lotta or the spirits... And why does it feel like we've been through this before...?) June 19Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: (The police are busily running here and there, and I don't see Maya anywhere...) Gumshoe: H-Hey, you! Don't touch anything! Phoenix: Look, I really need to ask you some questions! Gumshoe: Umm... Don't look at me like I'm some sort of uncaring jerk... Tell you what, pal. I'll let you ask me a few questions, alright? Examine Anywhere Gumshoe: Hey, pal! No touching without my permission! Phoenix: I'm just looking at it. Gumshoe: Hey, I can't be too careful if a kid like her can be a murder suspect, now can I? Phoenix: (I guess if I want to search this room, I'm going to have to come back later...) Talk Maya Phoenix: Um, about Maya... Gumshoe: I hate to break this to you, pal, but... with the way things look now, that girl's the only one who could've done it. Phoenix: (Yeah. Only Maya and the victim were inside this room, after all...) But Maya is... Gumshoe: You can ask more about her later, pal. Right now, I've got a job to do and that's collecting evidence. Phoenix: (Detective Gumshoe looks like a real professional. And yet, something about his expression still looks the same...) Cause of death Phoenix: So... Dr. Grey was shot with a gun, huh? Gumshoe: He was shot in the forehead. But... Phoenix: But...? Gumshoe: But he was also stabbed in the chest with a knife. Phoenix: (...A knife?) Gumshoe: Basically, the vic was first stabbed, then he was shot. (Changed from [After being stabbed, the final blow was a shot from a gun.] in the original release) Present Anything Gumshoe: Ah, I'm really busy right now. I can take a look at it later, alright, pal? Phoenix: (He didn't even take a glance at it...) June 19Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: (Hmm, I'm pretty sure there was someone sleeping here earlier...) ???: Like, how can I help you? Phoenix: Ack! Ah, I'm, uh... That is... I... ???: Um, like, so isn't it about time to start? Phoenix: Huh? Time to start what? ???: You know, like, the channeling! Phoenix: Channeling...? Oh, oh, oh, oh!! No, actually, the situation has kind of changed... ???: Huh? Like, what do you mean? Phoenix: Please stay calm, but... there has been a murder! (Changed from [Please stay calm, but... a murder has taken place!] in the original release) ???: ... Um, so, like... A murder is that thing where, like, one person kills another, right? Phoenix: Yes! A person has killed another person! ???: Oh, that's... Uh... What are the words I'm looking for...? It's like... ...like totally a bummer. Phoenix: ...Yeah... (After all that effort, that's all she had to say?) ???: Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to, like, introduce myself. Ini: My name is Ini Miney. Um... At the college, I'm researching and studying \"parapsychology\". Phoenix: \"Parapsychology\"? Ini: That's right. Um... I think people, like, usually call it, \"occult studies\" or something. Like supernatural phenomenon, ESP and psychic powers. That sort of stuff. Phoenix: (That's pretty out there...) I'm Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. Examine Bed on right Phoenix: You left the blanket a mess. Are you going to fold it? Ini: Like I had a really good nap, and, like... I was thinking of leaving it like this, so, like, it's all set for tonight. Talk Ini Miney Phoenix: So what brings you here today? Ini: Um, like, so... I was the one who told Dr. Grey about this place. He asked me, like, \"Do you know of a good spirit medium?\" Phoenix: (Hmm, Dr. Grey did say something about being introduced to this place.) Ini: Cause, like, talking to dead people and, like, multiple personalities are my thing... Phoenix: I see... Then why were you taking a nap here? Ini: Like... I wasn't feeling good. Phoenix: Huh? Ini: I'm, like, allergic to sesame seeds. They, like, must've put some in the food they served for lunch. Phoenix: Oh, that doesn't sound fun. Ini: So I, like, felt sick, and came in here to, like, sleep. I totally feel, like, I've wasted my time 'cause I, like, slept a long time. What happened Phoenix: So you were sleeping here the entire time? Ini: Yeah. Ever since lunch... Phoenix: So you don't know anything about the murder that took place? Ini: Like, what? Oh, that! I, like, totally know nothing. So who was, like, you know, killed...? Phoenix: The surgeon that requested the channeling, Dr. Grey. Ini: ... The victim (appears after \"Ini Miney\" and \"What happened\") Phoenix: You and Dr. Grey knew each other, right? Ini: ...! I don't know any Dr. Grey! Phoenix: Oh really...? Then what was all that talk about him earlier? (Changed from [That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...] in the original release) Ini: Huh!? ...Well, uh... Like, a long, long time ago... I was, like, a patient, yeah. Phoenix: (She sounds like she's trying to hide something...) Present Maya Fey profile Ini: Oh, hey! That's, like, Maya Fey, right? She's, like, totally waaaay famous! Like, well, for people like us, like, you know? Phoenix: (\"Waaaay famous\"? Maya?) Ini: I mean, like, she's, like, the daughter of the Master, right? Phoenix: (Hmm... Well, at least she remembers some things.) Ini Miney profile Ini: Um... This face... Like, I think I've seen it somewhere before... Phoenix: What!? ...Y-You're joking, right? Ini: Ha ha, like, of course I am, silly! Phoenix: (Oh, thank goodness...) Any other evidence Ini: Like, I'm really sorry, but I'm not all that smart... so I don't, like, get it. Phoenix: (Hmm. Why does it feel like she's just putting on an act?) Any other profile Ini: I'm, like, totally bad at remembering people's names. Phoenix: Oh? Ini: But I, like, remember seeing that face somewhere before, like, I think... Phoenix: Well, thanks for trying. (I didn't think it was possible for someone to be this much of an airhead...) June 19Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (There's no one here... as usual.) Ack! ...H-Hey... How are you? Pearl: ... Phoenix: You're Pearl, right? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Hmm. Silent as ever... ...? What's that she's got in her hand? I've seen it somewhere before...) Talk Any option Phoenix: Um... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: (...What is it!? Is it my hair? Is it too spiky? Not spiky enough!?) Present Anything Phoenix: Um... Pearl: ...! Phoenix: (...What is it!? Is it my hair? Is it too spiky? Not spiky enough!?) After clearing \"Any ideas\" Talk option in Kurain Village and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber and Fey Manor - Side Room: June 19Fey ManorMeditation Room Morgan: Oh, dear madam... You have such impeccable timing. Ini: Like, what's all the buzz? Gumshoe: Ahem. Alright everyone, listen up! You too, pal! I'm going to give you all a brief update! Right now, it looks like the investigation's not going to be done until real late... Morgan: That is a terrible shame. I propose that everyone sleep here under the roof of the Fey Manor tonight. Phoenix: (What a mess. I can't believe how crazy this day turned out... Maya was arrested and taken away by the police. And I don't see myself getting any sleep tonight...) June 20, 8:02 AMFey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: (*yawn* Uuugh... Morning... I guess I must have nodded off at some point... I hope Maya's OK. I should hurry and get to the Detention Center, ASAP!) June 20, 10:34 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: N... Nick! Nick! I...! Phoenix: Maya! Maya: What am I going to do!? I never imagined it would turn out like this! Phoenix: Calm down, Maya! Take deep breaths. (Come to think of it, the first time I met her... It all started right here, in this detention center...) Maya: I finally... I finally get to see you again, and... Phoenix: It's not your fault. You didn't do it. Maya: No, I... I did it... I killed that person. Phoenix: But that wasn't you. Maya: It doesn't matter. It might as well have been me. I was too weak... and I... I couldn't control the spirit's power, so... Phoenix: (I don't want to bring up the case quite yet, but...) Maya: ...You don't have to be nice to me. I understand. Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. I wonder if he's bored. Not that I can tell since he never looks over this way. Talk Channeling Phoenix: So you're the Master or something of the Kurain School of Channeling...? Maya: Actually, my mother is for now. But since that title is passed from mother to daughter, I guess I will be someday... Phoenix: But many people think that channeling isn't real, that it's all just an act. Maya: You believe in us, don't you? Phoenix: Yeah... because I've seen it with my own eyes. (When Maya's channeling a spirit... not only her voice, but her whole physical appearance changes. It's a supernatural phenomenon that occurs every time. It happened this time, too... Dr. Grey said that he wanted to call the nurse, so... Maya's body must have taken on that nurse's appearance...) What happened Phoenix: What exactly happened in the Channeling Chamber? Maya: ... I went into that room with Dr. Grey, locked the door... and sat down across from him. Phoenix: OK... Maya: We closed our eyes...and I began the channeling. Phoenix: (This is sounding kind of creepy... like the beginning of a scary story...) Maya: And that's the last thing I remember... Phoenix: What? Maya: After a spirit comes into my body, I lose my self, my consciousness. Phoenix: Then, you don't remember a single thing? Maya: When I came to, I was being held in my aunt's arms. And there was blood... all over my clothes. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Maya: Oh! But... I do remember having a dream. Phoenix: A dream...? \"Dream\" (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: What kind of dream did you have while you were channeling...? Maya: Um... I can't remember it all that well, but... I was dead and buried in the ground. I couldn't move... and it was unbearable... Really suffocating... ...It went something like that. Phoenix: I... I see... (I have no idea what to say to that...) Maya: There was a really familiar smell too... Phoenix: Under the ground? Maya: Yeah, I can't quite place it, but I know I've smelled that same scent before... Present Maya Fey profile Maya: I... I can't face myself... Phoenix: (I should've known better...) Turner Grey profile Maya: !! T-The... That's the guy I k-killed... Phoenix: Ack! I'm sorry! (Why did I pull this picture out!?) Pearl Fey profile Maya: Pearly... She definitely has more than me... Phoenix: Huh? What are you talking about? Maya: Who I think the next Master should be... I mean, she's got more spiritual power than me, and she really works hard at her training... Phoenix: (Talk about bringing the mood down even further... *sigh*) Morgan Fey profile Maya: I... I can't face my aunt right now... Not now... that this has happened... Phoenix: It's alright, Maya. I'm sure she understands. She's on our side, after all. Maya: Yeah, I know... But still... Lotta Hart profile Maya: That's Lotta Hart... right? Phoenix: That girl is still after the next sensational photo. Maya: Ha ha. I guess some things never change. Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: I felt terrible during the questioning session... I mean, Gumshoe kept looking at me... with these really sad eyes... ... Any other evidence Maya: Sorry, Nick, but there's nothing really special about it. Any other profile Phoenix: So... what do you think about this person...? Maya: ...? Phoenix: (I guess I can't expect her to know anything about this person.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ... (...I guess this is about all the information I'm going to gather for today...) I'll be back later, Maya. In the meantime, please make sure you prepare it, OK? Maya: Huh? \"It\"? What is \"it\"? Phoenix: The document requesting me to be your attorney, of course. Maya: ...! But... Phoenix: What's wrong? Maya: Are you sure? I mean, I'm guilty! I'm a murderer! Phoenix: No one's decided that yet. Maya: But I did! I killed that person... with these... two hands...! Phoenix: That's enough, Maya. Maya: It's hopeless! If you defend me, you'll lose, I'm sure... Phoenix: Stop it! Maya: ... ...Help me... Nick, help me... I'm scared... Phoenix: Don't worry, I will. When is the trial? Maya: It sounds like tomorrow. Phoenix: (As usual, zero prep time...) Alright. I'm going now. Maya: Wait. Phoenix: ...? Maya: This jewel... This is called a Magatama. It's a magical charm and it's always protected me. Give this to Pearly... And I'm sure she'll lend you her spiritual powers. Magatama received from Maya. Present Maya's Magatama Maya: Make sure you show that to Pearly, OK, Nick? I'm sure she'll be a big help to you. June 20Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Phew. It feels like I've been gone forever. But it's only been one day... (Oh, that's right!) Where's that newspaper Dr. Grey brought the other day...? ...Ah, here it is. Right on top of my desk. (This is the only thing he left behind that's going to be of any help...) Newspaper Clipping 1 added to the Court Record. Examine Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Until recently, it had been a normal, business-class hotel. Houseplant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. It's a memento of my boss, Mia... who passed away. The rest of the room may be in shambles, but I always manage to care for this little fella. Poster Phoenix: A poster of the TV action hero, the Steel Samurai. Maya stuck it up here right before she left. I wouldn't say that the Steel Samurai and an attorney's office are a good match, but Maya threatened to curse me with some magic spell... so I guess it can stay. Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long, a layer of dust has started to form. One of these days, I should try to build up the courage to read one... Maybe. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I keep it neat for those rare occasions when I actually have a client in the office. After visiting Wright & Co. Law Offices or Kurain Village: June 20Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (Maya must still be in questioning... I hope the detectives are taking it easy on her, but... these kinds of cases aren't taken lightly. I guess I'll come back later.) June 20Kurain Village Phoenix: (I have to save Maya, no matter what! It's her life on the line! What in the world happened in that room yesterday?) June 20Fey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: (The Meditation Room nurtures all mediums young and old. Even mediums in training, I'd wager. But it's pretty deserted today... ...probably because of the murder yesterday...) June 20Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today... I should take this chance and thoroughly check this room. If I'm lucky, I might uncover a clue or two... Morgan: Oh, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Good morning. Morgan: I am on my way to go meet Mystic Maya, and I thought to bring her some items to make her feel more at home. Namely, tea so bitter you lose your tongue and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts. Phoenix: I'm sure Maya will be very grateful... Morgan: That's \"Mystic Maya\", good sir! Phoenix: (Urk. She is one scary lady.) Morgan: Oh, dear, sweet Mystic Maya... Pearl wept constantly for you last night, as did I. Phoenix: (I know it's important for me to search the site, but I should ask her some questions too, while I have the chance...) Examine (left side) Door Phoenix: The Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. The lock on it is broken, because, well... I broke it. It doesn't seem possible, but I managed to break it pretty badly. When we want to do something bad enough, people can do the most amazing things. Floor panels on left Phoenix: This is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air. No matter what I do, my eyes keep getting drawn to the pool of blood in the center here. Altar Phoenix: I guess this is an altar. Whatever it is, it feels very important. (Changed from [I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important.] in the original release) A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement. I'd guess they're used during the channeling... Folding screen Phoenix: It's a beautiful and expensive folding screen. It also looks quite old. There seems to be some sort of sacred text written on it, but I can't read it. ... ! Th-This is... It's a hole! Could this have been made by a bullet? Folding Screen added to the Court Record. Space behind folding screen Phoenix: There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. I hope no one is hiding back there. Talk What happened Phoenix: I would like to ask you a few questions about what happened yesterday. Morgan: Do you mean that awful tragedy? ???: That man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him... Phoenix: M-Maya? Step away from there! Morgan: Please leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police! Phoenix: What happened here in this room after I left? Morgan: Well... First, I struck Mystic Maya on the head. Phoenix: To make her go unconscious, correct? Morgan: That is correct. Next, I performed the Spirit Severing Technique. Phoenix: \"Spirit Severing Technique\"? Morgan: The spirit of that nurse was inside of Mystic Maya's body. I used the technique to send the nurse's spirit back to the other world. Phoenix: (I wonder if this kind of testimony is even admissible in a court of law...) Channeling Chamber Phoenix: By the way, what is this room exactly...? Morgan: The Channeling Chamber? This room was created for the sole purpose of preventing such a tragedy as yesterday. Phoenix: What do you mean? Morgan: Sometimes, when an inexperienced medium calls an especially strong spirit, that spirit may become violent and revolt, as you witnessed yesterday. Phoenix: Revolt? But how? Morgan: When a spirit enters a medium's body, she loses her will and her self steps aside. To put it another way, the spirit is borrowing the medium's body, good sir. Phoenix: But isn't that extremely dangerous? Morgan: An experienced medium has little problem controlling a spirit. Phoenix: But Maya... I mean, Mystic Maya... That was her first channeling... Morgan: And that was why I insisted on locking the door. However, I never thought that would be calling danger upon the client himself... I am grateful that one of our heirlooms was not damaged in this horrible incident. Phoenix: And that would be...? (Changed from [And that is...?] in the original release) Morgan: That folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings. (Changed from [It is that folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings.] in the original release) Along with the Kurain Sacred Urn, they are this village's most treasured possessions. If I ever found out that something had happened to either one... Oh, the inhumanity... Phoenix: (Odd for her to be worrying about the folding screen at a time like this... I guess this isn't just some dilapidated old screen after all...) Pearl Phoenix: So... How is Pearl today...? Morgan: Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Morgan: In this world, Pearl is my most treasured possession. When compared to even Mystic Maya, Pearl has the spiritual power to become a Master. Phoenix: Th-That's very impressive. Morgan: Until now, the women of the branch family have thought themselves to be inferior. .. But. Pearl is different! Her spiritual strength is so great; even greater than some of the main family! Yes, Pearl is a channeling prodigy and is the pride of the branch family! Phoenix: (Wow... She's really fired up now...) Morgan: In any case... Our world is so different from yours, perhaps it is best for you to quit, good sir. Phoenix: \"Quit\"? Quit what? Present Maya's Magatama Morgan: ...Oh my! Phoenix: Wh-What is it? Morgan: That... That is Mystic Maya's Magatama. Why would you have this in your possession!? Phoenix: I-I'm sorry! Morgan: Return it to Mystic Maya at once! Phoenix: Y-Yes, madam! (Why did I feel like I was being scolded by my own mother just now...?) Folding Screen Morgan: Ah, so even someone such as yourself can take interest in something like this. This is the Kurain Channeling Technique Sacred Writings. There are 6 panels in all. Phoenix: I see... But that's not what caught my eye. You see this hole here...? Morgan: It is an old screen, you see. It is only logical that perhaps a bug or worm of some sort is the culprit. Phoenix: (Even though this looks nothing like the eating patterns of any bug I know...) Maya Fey profile Morgan: I can hardly believe Mystic Maya has become like this. Directly influenced by the likes of you, and becoming caught up in a situation such as this... Phoenix: I'm sorry... (...Hey, hold on! How is all this MY fault!?) Morgan: I told her so many times, as I have also told Pearl, \"Do not associate with strange old men you don't know\". Phoenix: (Well, that shouldn't apply to me then, especially since I'm hardly an \"old man\" yet!!) Turner Grey profile Morgan: That doctor was one of those people. Those who intend harm upon the spirits receive harm in return; it's karma at work. It seems that he was the one to take the nurse's life, wouldn't you agree? Phoenix: (I guess that's possible...) Pearl Fey profile Morgan: Good sir! Phoenix: Y...Yes? Morgan: When did you take this picture!? This is one of those... what are they called...? Those... \"hidden camera\" pictures! Phoenix: N-No!! It's not one of those at all!! Morgan: Such an unforgivable offense! You will hand it over to me! Phoenix: N-No! I won't! (If I ever want to talk about Pearl again, I should be much more careful...) Morgan Fey profile Morgan: It shows the same face as the one I see in the mirror every day. Phoenix: And? Anything else? Morgan: No. That is all. Phoenix: (Why in the world did I bother to show this to her!?) Any other evidence Morgan: I will be leaving shortly to meet with Mystic Maya. I simply do not have the time to look at such trivial matters. Any other profile Morgan: We usually do not welcome strangers into our village as they disturb the aura here. Especially people like you, good sir. Phoenix: H-Hey, what do you mean, \"especially people like me?\" Morgan: You selfishly make Mystic Maya help you with your work... You should be thankful I have not taken your life for such a disrespectful act. Phoenix: Y-Yes, madam... Morgan: And even more importantly, remember that if anything were to happen to Pearl... Phoenix: (What is that supposed to mean!?) After clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen: Morgan: Well, then, I do believe it is time for me to take my leave. Phoenix: Alright. Please tell Maya I said hi. Morgan: What was that!? Phoenix: Uh, I mean, Mystic Maya. Morgan: I will tell her. Phoenix: (...*sigh*) June 20Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Little Pearl isn't here today... Maybe she's at school?) June 20Fey ManorSide Room Ini: Oh, hey! Like, you're that guy from yesterday... The, uh, dentist guy... Phoenix: No, no, I'm a lawyer. Ini: That's right! Um... Mr. Smith, Esquire. Phoenix: ...That's \"Wright\". Wait, I mean, you're wrong. My name is \"Wright\". Ini: \"Smith\", \"Wright\"... Well, I got, like, three letters, at least. Phoenix: (I don't think she gets the point...) Anyway, why are you here? Ini: So, like, I study this thing called \"parapsychology\" at this college and... Phoenix: Um, you told me about that yesterday. The sesame allergy, too. What I'd really like to know is why you're still here today? Ini: Oh! So, like, that's what you meant! Like, you shoulda been more, like, clear about it! Phoenix: S-Sorry. My bad. Ini: No, it's OK. Like, it's really... Phoenix: ... Ini: ...? Phoenix: ...That's it? Why'd you stop mid-sentence!? Ini: Did I? ...So, like... what was I talking about again...? Phoenix: ... (If Lotta ever wanted another \"genuine mysterious phenomenon\", it's right here.) Examine Wooden bear sculpture Phoenix: It's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. \"Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling\" What the!? It's a souvenir. Ini: Isn't it cuuuuute? I, like, totally bought that! Phoenix: Ah... so it's yours, huh? Ini: Yeah. So, like, this village is really famous for, like, channeling and bears. Phoenix: Heh. (...Wait. Famous for bears!?) Ini: But it's, like, OK. If you ever, like, see a bear, you just play dead, and they, like, leave you alone. Phoenix: I-Is that right? Ini: Yeah. Cause, like, fighting back is totally of no use. Phoenix: (Has she actually tried to fight one!?) Yellow box Phoenix: Hmm, now where did this box come from? I'm sure this wasn't here last night. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom. Talk Ini Miney Phoenix: So? Why are you still here today? Ini: Like, there's so much for me to, like, study here! Phoenix: Like what? Ini: Like, the medium's training, or like, how they inherit their spiritual power. Phoenix: (I suppose... This village is the real thing, after all.) Ini: So, like, I asked if I could stay here for, like, a little longer. Phoenix: (She sure seems like the care-free type, at least, on the surface...) What happened Phoenix: Have you heard about the murder? Ini: It's, like, totally scary. Phoenix: (...she says, with a silly smile plastered on her face...) ...So do you know anything about it that might help? Ini: ... Phoenix: (Somehow, I don't think she has a grip on reality, let alone what's going on here.) The victim Phoenix: About the victim, Dr. Grey... Ini: I don't know who you're talking about. ...Like... Wait, I think you asked about him, like, yesterday, too... Phoenix: (That's right... Her reaction yesterday when I asked was...) Phoenix: You and Dr. Grey knew each other, right? Ini: ...! I don't know any Dr. Grey! Phoenix: Oh really...? Then what was all that talk about him earlier? (Changed from [That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...] in the original release) Ini: Huh!? ...Well, uh... Like, a long, long time ago... I was, like, a patient, yeah. Phoenix: (OK, she is definitely hiding something from me...) Ini: ...Like, is something wrong? Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Would you take a look at this? Ini: Hey! It's, like, one of those little badges people in Congress all wear... Phoenix: No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. L-A-W-Y-E-R!! Ini: ...? Like, so is that what you are? Maya's Magatama Ini: Wow! It's a Magatama! Aww, you shouldn't have! Phoenix: It's so totally not for you! Ini: Hey! Like, it's not nice to freak me out like that! Phoenix: (That should be my line...) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: I wanted to ask you about this girl... Ini: Oh, that's, like, Maya Fey. She's, like, the Master's daughter. Phoenix: You surprise me. You knew that? Ini: Well, like, I totally know everyone related to the occult. Maya is, like, an idol among spirit mediums. Phoenix: (Maya an idol? I guess stranger things have happened.) Morgan Fey profile Ini: That's Morgan Fey. Like, she's been totally helpful. Phoenix: (Did she just bow to the picture...?) Ini: So what about her? Phoenix: Oh, nothing in particular. I just wanted to know what you knew about her. Ini: Um... Well, she's, like, a really good person. Phoenix: I see. Ini: Like totally. Phoenix: OK. (This is going nowhere...) Ini Miney profile Ini: Um... This face... Like, I think I've seen it somewhere before... Phoenix: What!? ...Y-You're joking, right? Ini: Ha ha, like, of course I am, silly! Phoenix: (Oh, thank goodness...) Any other evidence Ini: Like, I'm really sorry, but... And I know, like, you totally had your heart set on it, but I can't, like, take it. Phoenix: (Who said anything about giving this to you!?) Any other profile Phoenix: What do you know about this person...? Ini: I'm, like, sorry, but it's totally, like, time for my nap... Phoenix: *yawn* (Ack! She's even got ME yawning!) Ini: And I, like, totally don't care about that person anyway... After clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber, and clearing \"The victim\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Side Room: June 20Fey ManorWinding Way Pearl: ... Phoenix: Ack! Y-You surprised me! Pearl: ... Phoenix: And how are you today? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Hmm... I guess she isn't open to friendly chatting... Huh? She's still holding something in her hand... ...It looks like the same thing she had yesterday...) Talk Any option Phoenix: Um... Pearl: Aaaah! Phoenix: H-Huh?? (If only I had something that would catch her interest. Maybe then she'd talk to me.) Present Maya's Magatama Leads to: \"Oh yeah. Maya said to give this to you...\" Anything else Phoenix: Can you take a look at this? Please? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Urk... She's really scrutinizing my face...) Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Th-That's enough already! I'm not that shifty-looking, am I!?) Phoenix: Oh yeah. Maya said to give this to you... Pearl: ... Phoenix: (Ack! I'm in trouble now!! If Morgan sees us like this, I'll be the next one they're channeling...) Pearl: Th-That's... That's Mystic Maya's... Phoenix: ...Huh!? (Sh-She actually spoke!) Pearl: Who are you...? Phoenix: I-I'm Phoenix Wright. I, uh, worked with Maya... Pearl: ...Y-You worked with Mystic Maya...? You... You're Mr. Nick, right? Phoenix: ...Uh, excuse me? (I bet I know who she picked \"Nick\" up from...) Pearl: I know who you are. You're... You're Mystic Maya's... \"special someone\"... Phoenix: WH-WH-WH-WHAT!? Pearl: So then... Of course! You're going to help Mystic Maya, aren't you? That's what you're going to do, right? Phoenix: W-Well, yeah... I will... Pearl: Oh wow... It's like a beautiful fairy tale! That earnest look shining brightly in your eyes... It must be true love... Phoenix: ...Wh-What!? (Why am I being boiled into a bright red lobster by this little kid!?) Pearl: I'm so jealous of Mystic Maya! Ah, what a wonderful relationship... Phoenix: W-Wait... I... uhh... I mean... We aren't... Things aren't like... Pearl: Hee hee, I can tell you're a good person. Alright, Mr. Nick! I may be small, but I'm going to help you in any way I can! Talk Pearl Phoenix: Pearl, are you friends with Maya? Pearl: I feel very grateful to be friends with her... She's so great. I want to be like Mystic Maya when I grow up. I really look up to her. Phoenix: Wow, I had no idea Maya was so... revered. Pearl: Usually when people don't use Mystic Maya's title, I get mad. Phoenix: O-Oh, sorry. Pearl: But if it's you, Mr. Nick, then it's OK. Because... Because... you're \"special\" to her. Phoenix: (Where in the world did she get an idea like that??) Pearl: By the way... this may be rude, but which channeling school are you from? Phoenix: Which channeling school? Pearl: Yes. For example, I study the Kurain technique. Phoenix: ... Ah, I get it! No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. A lawyer. Pearl: ...Law...yer? Phoenix: Yup. Pearl: ...Is that related to spirit mediums in any way...? Phoenix: (Um... None that I know of...) Wait, are you telling me you don't know what a lawyer is? Pearl: I'm sorry, but I have no idea. Phoenix: (Maya did say Pearl doesn't know much about the outside world...) The item in your hand Phoenix: So what's that you've got there, Pearl? Pearl: Oh, this? I found it yesterday. Phoenix: Hmm... Pearl: If you want it, I can give it to you. Accept it Leads to: \"Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me...\" Don't accept it Phoenix: I can't take something this important from you, Pearl. Pearl: Oh... Phoenix: (But I'm sure I've seen that key somewhere before... ...and it might be an important clue later on...) Leads to: \"Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me...\" Phoenix: Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me... Pearl: Hee hee. You look like a child at a toy store, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: (...She not only speaks in a refined manner, but laughs in one, too!) Black Key added to the Court Record. Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: So this is... Pearl: That is Mystic Maya's Magatama. It's one of the most important heirlooms of Kurain Village. Please make sure to take good care of it. Phoenix: Y-Yeah, I will. (Is it really OK for me to have such a priceless object?) Folding Screen Pearl: Are you interested in Kurain's traditional things too, Mr. Nick? The Kurain Sacred Writings are on this folding screen. Phoenix: Oh? Is that what's written on it? Actually, what caught my eye was this \"hole\" in it... Pearl: It's a very old screen, so I think that maybe bugs made it by eating through it. Phoenix: (...It sure doesn't look like something bugs can make...) Black Key Phoenix: About this key... Pearl: I found it while I was playing in the garden yesterday. Phoenix: I've seen it before too, you know? Pearl: ...? Really? Maya Fey profile Pearl: I look up to Mystic Maya a lot. She's my role model. She's so smart, and pretty, and kind, and loving. She's always cheerful, never gets sick, isn't picky, and has good sleeping habits. She always wakes up before me, and always eats breakfast before me too. And she has you; such a wonderful person with whom she can share a lo- Phoenix: Ack! OK, OK! I get the idea! (She really thinks the world of Maya, doesn't she?) Pearl Fey profile Pearl: To tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother won't let me. Phoenix: Your hair now suits you quite well, though, I think. Pearl: R-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget* Phoenix: *fidget, fidget* Morgan Fey profile Pearl: Oh, it's my mother! She takes really good care of me and loves me very much. She says I'm the \"pride of the branch family\"... But I don't know what that means. Phoenix: (\"Branch family\"... That concept is probably still too hard for little Pearl...) Any other evidence Pearl: I'm sure it is helpful to you in some way, but I'm still in training, so I don't know anything about it. I'm really, deeply sorry. Phoenix: No, no, no, it's OK. I shouldn't have shown you something so trivial anyway. I'm very sorry. (This feels so weird, talking to a kid like this...) Any other profile Pearl: Hmm, I'm sorry I don't know who this person is. Phoenix: I guess that makes sense... You've never left Kurain village, after all. Pearl: I'm really sorry, Mr. Nick. I just don't really know anyone outside the village. After clearing all Talk options: Pearl: Um, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: Yes, Pearls? I can call you that, right? You're too cute to just call you Pearl. Pearl: Sure, Mr. Nick... Umm... Are you sure it's OK for me to have this Magatama? Phoenix: Yeah, it's OK. I was told to give it to you. Pearl: But, I can't accept something like this! ...All I really should do is charge this Magatama with spiritual energy... Phoenix: Spiritual energy? Pearl: Please take this. I'm sure it will be helpful. Phoenix: ...What do you mean? Pearl: It will let you see people's secrets. Phoenix: See people's... secrets...? Pearl: Yes. ...If it's alright with you, I would like to accompany you for a little while. I can explain the Magatama's power to you when we meet someone hiding a secret. June 20Fey ManorMeditation Room Gumshoe: Hey, it's you, pal! So you're going to be her lawyer, I bet. Phoenix: Yes. Gumshoe: Oh... I really feel bad for you, pal. Just this once, I wish I could be on your side. Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... Gumshoe: Yeah, but I shouldn't be saying that kind of stuff to you. Hey! You're a cute kid. Pearl: ... Gumshoe: Ha ha ha. I'm not scary. Honest! Phoenix: (Wow, I never knew Gumshoe liked kids...) Gumshoe: H-Hey! I know! I'll show you something cool! How's this? It's a real, genuine pistol... Phoenix: D-Detective Gumshoe!! What are you doing showing her something that dangerous! Gumshoe: Oh, sorry... Talk Maya's guilt Phoenix: What about Maya and the charges against her? Gumshoe: I don't think you can win, pal. If you're talking about proof, we've got a few pieces. Phoenix: You've got proof...? Gumshoe: Yeah, pal. That puffy-haired photographer's going to testify tomorrow. Phoenix: (He must be talking about Lotta. Actually... speaking of Lotta...) Lotta: I took some hot pictures earlier! Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: Remember!? I took some pictures at the murder scene inside! Phoenix: (Lotta's \"hot pictures\"... I wonder what her camera captured...?) Gumshoe: ...Besides, you must've realized by now, pal. There's no way anyone other than Maya Fey could've done it. Phoenix: (...!) Pearl: ... Phoenix: (What am I supposed to say to Pearls now...?) The victim Phoenix: About Dr. Grey... Gumshoe: The victim wasn't super famous, but people still knew who he was. His face was all over those tabloid shows last year. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. Gumshoe: I was looking through some newspapers from last year, and... ... Huh? I could've sworn I had... I cut an article out, but I guess I must've lost it... Phoenix: (He's searching through his pockets... And boy, are those big...) Gumshoe: Hmm... It looked really interesting, too. Hey, do you have a copy, pal? Phoenix: (A copy of that article...? I think Dr. Grey might have brought a copy to the office when he came by...) Tomorrow's trial Phoenix: About Maya's trial tomorrow... Gumshoe: I've got two pieces of news for you, pal. Phoenix: Two? Gumshoe: Yeah. \"Bad news\" and \"even worse news.\" So which do you want to hear first? Phoenix: ...I don't really care... It doesn't change the fact that I'm not going to like it. Gumshoe: Alright, pal. Well, the prosecutor for the trial is Prosecutor von Karma. Phoenix: WHAT!? Von Karma!? Phoenix: (Manfred von Karma... He was an awe-inspiring veteran prosecutor. He never lost a case in the 40 years of his career, and he raised a fearsome disciple. The horrible aftertaste of the evil he force-fed me is something I'll never forget.) Phoenix: ... Wait a sec. But didn't Von Karma stand trial and... Gumshoe: That's where the other piece of bad news comes in... The Von Karma you're facing tomorrow is actually his successor... Phoenix: Successor...? Successor (appears after \"Tomorrow's trial\") Phoenix: So, um... Who is this \"successor\" to Von Karma? Gumshoe: Literally, pal, it's Prosecutor von Karma's kid. His kid became a prosecutor real young... like 13, and hasn't lost a trial since. That's what they call a \"prodigy,\" pal. Phoenix: Hmm... Kid, huh... ... W-W-Wait a sec! Th-Th-Thirteen!? The kid became a prosecutor at the age of THIRTEEN!? I mean, a prodigy like that... I would have heard something about... Gumshoe: Oh, no, no. The kid was born and raised in Germany, pal. That country's got a lot of stuff and is a great place to develop a person's talents. Phoenix: (Germany, huh? That's probably why I've never heard of this person. Ugh... Still, all it takes is someone mentioning the name \"Von Karma\", and I get terrible flashbacks to that case. Stop it! Get a grip on yourself, Phoenix! (Changed from [Stop it! Get over it, Phoenix!] in the original release) None of that matters anymore... now that he's gone... (Changed from [That person is already gone...] in the original release)) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, look. It's my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Ha ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge. Pearl: Uh, um... Mr. Nick? Phoenix: What is it, Pearls? Pearl: I was wondering if I could see it, too? Phoenix: Ah, no, it's OK. It's not that important anyway. Maya's Magatama Phoenix: What do you think about this...? Gumshoe: Hey, that's a pretty nice-looking brooch! You should stop wearing that ugly old attorney's badge, and start wearing that, pal. Pearl: Hee, hee. That detective is so nice! Aren't you happy, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: (Happy?... About what?) Newspaper Clipping 1 Phoenix: Um, Dr. Grey brought this over to my office the other day, and... Gumshoe: Hey! It's that news story! The one about the malpractice suit! Phoenix: Fourteen patients died and it caused a huge stink. Gumshoe: Yeah, but that's not all, pal. Things only got worse after that. Phoenix: You mean the car accident the nurse died in? Gumshoe: ...Hmm... Oh, here we go. I brought my own clipping with me today. Here, pal, this is for you. Phoenix: Alright. Thanks. Newspaper Clipping 2 added to the Court Record. Newspaper Clipping 1 (subsequent times) Gumshoe: The nurse that killed the patients ended up getting killed in an accident. Dr. Grey wound up on a lot of tabloid shows because of that. Now, there was a smart man. I'm sure that was a great way to advertise for his clinic. Phoenix: (Uh, huh. Scaring people off is always the best way to get more patients.) Black Key Phoenix: So about this key... Gumshoe: Hey, is that your house key or something, pal? Phoenix: Come on, does this look like a house key to you? Gumshoe: Then what's it for? Phoenix: It's... ... (Hmm, actually, I should probably keep that a secret...) It's my bicycle key. Gumshoe: Oh. Nothing special, huh? Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: I'm sorry things had to turn out this way, pal. Phoenix: It's too early to give up! No one's proven her guilty of anything, yet! Gumshoe: Look, even if there were a zillion of you, pal, this is a case you... *sigh* Phoenix: (Now why is he sighing?) Pearl Fey profile Gumshoe: Oh, so that's little Pearl. Phoenix: Do you know her? Gumshoe: Only that Ms. Fey was looking for her earlier. Something about being worried that she'll end up talking to the weird guy. So, you have any idea who this \"weird guy\" is, pal? Phoenix: ...Nope. Not a clue. Morgan Fey profile Gumshoe: That's Maya's aunt, right? I got to eat one of her giant strawberry desserts earlier. It was really good! Phoenix: (Aw, I didn't get to eat one yet...) Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: Boy do I look scary in this picture. I guess if I want people to stop thinking cops are scary, I have to change myself. Gotta smile, gotta smile! Phoenix: (There's that classic Gumshoe goofy smile again...) Any other evidence Gumshoe: Ooh, I'd better shut my mouth. Phoenix: Uh, what? Gumshoe: I'm not gonna give you any information about evidence, pal. Phoenix: Oh. Any other profile Gumshoe: I don't have anything to tell you about this one, pal. Phoenix: You don't have to be so mean about it. Gumshoe: Not. A. Word. Pearl: ... Gumshoe: H-H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Phoenix: (That girl has one intense stare... *gulp*) June 20Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: Hello again. We seem to be seeing a lot of each other today. Ini: Aww, she's, like, tooootally cute! Is she, like, your daughter? Phoenix: W-What!? NO! (How old do you think I am!?) Talk The victim Phoenix: I want to ask you about the victim, Dr. Grey. Ini: I, like, totally don't know him. 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: Aaack! What is that!? Ini: ...? Pearl: You can see it, can't you, Mr. Nick? You can see the \"lock\" on that person's heart. Phoenix: Huh, what...? Pearl: This is the power of the Magatama. Only you can see these \"Psyche-Locks\", Mr. Nick. Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks, huh...) Pearl: The more someone wants to hide their secret, the more locks you will see. If it's only one, I think you can easily unlock it. Phoenix: \"Unlock\"...? But how? Pearl: Please use Mystic Maya's Magatama on this person, and let's remove the lock. Phoenix: (I have no idea what she's talking about, but... Guess I'll give it a try.) Pearl: You must be careful, though, Mr. Nick. If you make a mistake, it will hurt you. If you don't think you have the proof you need, you must have the courage to stop. Phoenix: (Well, I've got to start somewhere. Let's give this Psyche-Lock thing a try.) The victim (subsequent times) Phoenix: Iim going to ask you again. Did you know Dr. Grey? Ini: I totally don't know that guy. Like, you're totally more presistent than a roach! 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (This girl is hiding something! I'm sure of it! I guess I have no choice but to remove this lock. Alright, so first, I have to use Maya's Magatama...) The victim (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Leads to: \"Please, tell me all you know about Dr. Grey.\" Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK -- The Victim -- Phoenix: Ini Miney. I believe you do know who Dr. Grey is! Ini: I told you! Like, how many times do I, like, have to repeat myself? If you're, like, so totally sure, then where's, like, your proof? Phoenix: While it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person, I do believe you might have at least, indirectly known of him. Ini: Like, what do you mean, like, \"indirectly\"...? Phoenix: (I should try to show that the possibility existed for now...) (Hmm, so, something that shows a possible connection between Ini and Dr. Grey...) Present Newspaper Clipping 2 Phoenix: Leads to: \"Take a look at this newspaper clipping.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here is your proof! Ini: Like, what is that...? Phoenix: Ouch... I guess it doesn't have anything to do with it, huh? (Pearls did warn me... \"If you make a mistake, it will hurt you,\" she said. If I don't have enough evidence, I should probably \"stop\". I should take another look at the Court Record and think it through one more time.) Leads back to: \"While it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person,\" Phoenix: Take a look at this newspaper clipping. Ini: Like, what is it? ... A story about an accident? Phoenix: Please read the victim's name. Ini: Um...\"Mimi Miney\"... Phoenix: \"Miney\" is a pretty rare last name, wouldn't you say? Ms. Mimi Miney wouldn't happen to be a relative of yours, would she? Ini: ...! So you noticed. Sh-She was my older sister. Phoenix: I'm sorry about your loss... Your sister... Was she a nurse... Perhaps at Dr. Grey's surgical clinic? Ini: ...! Phoenix: Grey Surgical Clinic... I don't think I need to tell you that the clinic was run by the victim, Dr. Turner Grey. Which is how you knew of Dr. Grey; you knew him through your sister! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Phoenix: Please, tell me all you know about Dr. Grey. Ini: My... My sister's name was Mimi Miney. She was, like, a nurse at Dr. Grey's clinic. Phoenix: (That's what I thought...) Ini: I heard that, like, Dr. Grey was really tough on people. Like, a total slave driver. My sis was, like, always coming home totally wiped out 'cause she was overworked. Phoenix: Wiped out? So is that why she fell asleep at the wheel? Ini: That guy, like, drove my sis so hard, so, like, that's why the accident happened. Phoenix: The one where 14 patients died from malpractice? Ini: Yeah, like, I think that was the doctor's fault, too. My sis was pushed by, like, everyone's expectations and, like, her duties and stuff. And that pushed her to her death. Phoenix: Oh... I'm sorry... Ini: So, like, are we done? I've, like, already told my story to, like, everyone... Pearl: Do you understand now, Mr. Nick? This is how a Psyche-Lock works. Phoenix: ...Well, I don't plan to pry into people's hearts unless I absolutely need to... Pearl: The lock this time was pretty easy, but... you might meet people who aren't as willing to give in later on. If you don't have enough proof, be careful and know when to stop trying. After clearing \"Successor\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Meditation Room and clearing \"The victim\" Talk option upon breaking Psyche-Lock in Fey Manor - Side Room: June 20Kurain Village Pearl: Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Hmm? What's wrong? Pearl: I have never left Kurain Village. Phoenix: R-Really? Wow, that's, um, pretty amazing... Pearl: You are going to meet with Mystic Maya... aren't you? Please tell her I said hi. Phoenix: Hey, wait! (She ran off... Again. Well, I know Ini's secret now, but... I still don't have any idea how I'm going to save Maya. I don't even know if I should go in there with a smile or a straight face... *sigh*) June 20Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (What am I supposed to do!? I'm almost out of time! Can I really do anything? Can I really save her...?) ???: Sorry to keep you waiting. Phoenix: (Huh? Must be Maya...) ???: It's been a long time, hasn't it, Phoenix? Phoenix: ...! (That voice...) M-Mia! Mia: Even without me being here, it looks like you've learned to stand on your own. Phoenix: (Mia... She's Maya's older sister, and my mentor. She was a top-notch defense lawyer, but a certain case forced her into \"retirement\". But... whenever I'm in trouble, she comes to help, just like this. Her spirit comes back from the other world and borrows Maya's body for a bit...) Mia: Phoenix, you can't make that kind of face in front of your client. Phoenix: ...! Mia: A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets, and especially when it's bad. Phoenix: Mia... Mia: You can't smile at the end if you haven't been smiling the whole way there. In any case, the face you're making now is no face to show a client, Phoenix. Phoenix: B-But! Mia: So, tell me all about it. I'm going to guess that my sister is in a lot of trouble again... Phoenix: (I told her everything about what had happened in the last two days. Mia closed her eyes, deep in thought, while she listened...) Mia: ...I see... Phoenix: Mia... What am I supposed to do? Mia: ... It's pretty clear what a good lawyer does in this situation. Phoenix: A-And that is!? Tell me, please! Mia: Believe in your convictions. And fight for the complete acquittal of your client. Talk Not guilty Phoenix: You think Maya's not guilty!? How can you be so sure!? Mia: I know she is. And I'll give you a hint as to why. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: Mediums can't have dreams. Phoenix: Can't have \"dreams\"...? Mia: From what you told me, it sounds like Maya was having a dream while channeling. Phoenix: Yeah... She said she dream that she had died and had been buried in the ground. Mia: But that is impossible. You've heard it from her, I'm sure. When a medium channels, her own spirit disappears. Which means that it's impossible for her to dream during that time. Phoenix: ...! Then... What does this mean!? Mia: I think it's safe to bet that Maya was set-up. Phoenix: A set-up!? Mia: It's up to you to blow the lid on this case tomorrow and show how she was set-up. Evidence? Phoenix: How am I supposed to prove her innocence when I have nothing to go on!? Mia: If you're looking for a clue, it's already in your hands. Phoenix: I-It is!? Mia: Just as it sounds, Phoenix, you already hold the \"key\". Phoenix: (R-Really...?) Mia: Come on, show me the \"key\" to this case. Phoenix: (The \"key\", huh? Alright, I'll show it to her; the \"key\" I hold.) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Mia... Mia: *chuckle* Wow, this badge brings back a lot of memories, doesn't it...? I would love to stand with you at the defense table one more time. Phoenix: (Mia...) Maya's Magatama Mia: This is... Maya's Magatama, isn't it? Why do you have it...? Phoenix: Maya gave it to me, but... Mia: I see... ... This is something very important to me. Take good care of it, OK? Phoenix: (She looks at it with such a soft look in her eyes...) Black Key Phoenix: Mia, have you seen this key before? Mia: Ahh, the key... It's literally, the key to understanding everything that's happened in this case. Phoenix: This key? Mia: Phoenix, listen. Right now, that key is sitting in your hand. However, it shouldn't be. ... It contradicts the \"facts\". Phoenix: (What does she mean...?) Mia: I'm certain this key will be the piece of evidence that makes your case tomorrow. Maya Fey profile Mia: I can't see Maya... when I'm in her body like this... But I can tell. She's very lonely and sad. Take good care of her, will you, Phoenix? Phoenix: I-I will... Pearl Fey profile Mia: Pearly! She's really grown up... I left Kurain Village a long time ago. She probably doesn't remember a thing about me by now... Morgan Fey profile Mia: I'm afraid I might have caused Aunt Morgan a lot of stress. When I left Kurain, I left Maya in my aunt's care. And now something like this happens... Dick Gumshoe profile Mia: I've seen this man somewhere before... He had a strange name... and I'm almost sure I've questioned him before. I remember him making a show of confidence at first, but after five minutes, he breaks down and... ...you end up feeling bad for the poor guy... Mia Fey profile Mia: That's right. I'm already dead. But I feel very grateful to have been born a Fey... so I can talk with you like this... Any other evidence Phoenix: Could you take a look at this? Mia: ...Do you have anything more useful? There's no time left. Try to show me something that will help you in tomorrow's trial. Any other profile Mia: I'm sorry, but I don't remember who that is... After clearing all Talk options and presenting Black Key: Mia: ... ... You already know everything you need to know. You know what the \"key\" to this case is... That is enough... Phoenix: But... But! How can I win tomorrow without knowing who the real murderer is!? Who... Who could have...? Mia: ... Phoenix: (I didn't know it at the time, (Changed from [At the time, I didn't know,] in the original release) but this day was going to end with a turn for the surprising...) 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: M-Mia!? Wh-What...!? Mia: What's wrong? Phoenix: (That's right. Only I can see the Psyche-Locks... Which means... Mia must know something about the real murderer! But for this to be something that she would hide under lock and key from even me... What in the world is going on!?) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!) Reunion, and Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 June 21, 9:48 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Maya: Whaaaaaaaat!? Prosecutor von Karma!? You mean...? Phoenix: No, I heard it's his successor this time... Maya: Successor...? ... Manfred von Karma... was a really sinister man. (Changed from [Manfred von Karma. He was a really sinister man.] in the original release) He pulled all sorts of nasty tricks; all so he could win. Phoenix: (He was a man obsessed with the word \"perfection\"... He had a perfect record... for forty long years. Who knows what sorts of dirty tricks he used to get each of those guilty verdicts? And now, his successor... I wonder what kind of person they will turn out to be...) Maya: It's no good... Mystic Maya!! Maya: Pearly! You showed up! Thanks for coming all this way! Pearl: I was really worried about you... Maya: Hey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together? Pearl: Mother is watching over the trainees. She said they have training for two days straight with no breaks. Maya: Huh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself? Pearl: Yup! I snuck out of the manor and followed a map. Phoenix: Don't tell me you walked all the way here... Pearl: Of course not! ...I ran! Phoenix: That's... I can't... Oh my... (If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...) Maya: Pearly... What about the train? Pearl: Huh? What's a... \"tray-in\"? Phoenix: (I give up...) Pearl: ...It's time, isn't it? Maya: Um... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma! Pearl: Mr. Eh-ji-werth? Who is that? Maya: Um, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend. I still remember him as though I'd seen him only yesterday. (Changed from [I still remember him as if I had just seen him only yesterday.] in the original release) Every trial was a scorchingly fierce battle until the very end. (Changed from [Every trial was a scorching fierce battle until the very end.] in the original release) It was always back and forth with them. But when you're rivals for life... Phoenix: Maya! Please don't mention that name ever again... Maya: Huh...? But why, Nick? Phoenix: I'm... I'm sorry, Maya. I forgot you don't know... He... He's... He's gone... And he's not coming back... Maya: Whaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!? Bailiff: Court will commence shortly. Please proceed into the courtroom. Phoenix: ... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway. Maya: N...Nick...? June 21, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2 Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey. Are the prosecution and the defense prepared? ???: ... Phoenix: ... (What is with this kid...?) (Changed from [... (What is with this girl...?)] in the original release) Judge: ... *Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you prepared!? (Changed from [*Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you finally prepared!?] in the original release) Phoenix: Huh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. (Why does he always seem mad at me!?) ???: Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: ...! ???: You must be a little shocked because I am a woman, correct? Phoenix: (...Hold on. So SHE'S the famed \"successor\" to Prosecutor von Karma...?) (Changed from [...Hold on. So this kid is the 'famed' Prosecutor von Karma...?] in the original release) von Karma: I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy. Phoenix: I... see... von Karma: I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge. Phoenix: Revenge...? (Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?) Judge: Um... If it's something of a personal nature, I'm sure you can... Oww! von Karma: I'm talking. If you interrupt again, my whip will do the speaking for me. Phoenix: (Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...) Yeow!! von Karma: Make no mistake; I will defeat you! Prepare to go down, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Judge: Prosecutor von Karma, your opening statement, please... von Karma: Those of Von Karma blood have only one fate. And that is \"perfection\". The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch. Judge: V-Very well... What is the defense's position? Phoenix: Your Honor. Judge: Does the defense wish to enter a plea of \"not guilty\"? Phoenix: ...Yes. von Karma: Foolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the \"justified self-defense\" plea in no time. Phoenix: (\"Justified self-defense\"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of themself. (Changed from [A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself.] in the original release) We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of \"not guilty\", Your Honor! (Because to plead \"justified self-defense\" is to say you did kill someone.) von Karma: How foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness. Phoenix: (She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.) von Karma: Witness, your name and occupation? Gumshoe: Yes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!! von Karma: Get to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder. Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room. Judge: What were they doing in there? Gumshoe: Um... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir. Judge: Ch-Channeling a spirit?? Phoenix: (That's quite the look of disbelief there, Your Honor...) (Changed from [The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...] in the original release) Gumshoe: *ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room. Judge: Ah, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over. Floor Plans added to the Court Record. Judge: So, how was the victim killed? Gumshoe: I was about to get to that... von Karma: Stop wasting my time, then. Witness Testimony -- Cause of Death -- Gumshoe: The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir. The shot was fired from point-blank range. But before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest. The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death. The murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing. Judge: Hmm... So the victim was stabbed before being shot... Gumshoe: This is the victim's autopsy report, sir. Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: The court accepts it into evidence. Mr. Wright, you may question the witness. Cross Examination -- Cause of Death -- Gumshoe: The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The murder weapon, Detective Gumshoe. Whose pistol was it? Gumshoe: It was the victim's. Phoenix: The victim? Now, why would he have... von Karma: von Karma: \"Why would he have a pistol?\" Who cares? The point that you are missing is whose fingerprints are on that pistol. If you're not already paying attention to that, then I suggest you start. Judge: Fingerprints? There were fingerprints? Gumshoe: Along with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir. Judge: Hmm. So the defendant's fingerprints were left on the murder weapon... Phoenix: (Argh...! I walked right into her hands there.) (Changed from [Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.] in the original release) Gumshoe: The shot was fired from point-blank range. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Point blank, huh? So about how far away was it? Gumshoe: It was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away. Phoenix: And how do you know he was shot at point blank? von Karma: Tsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I grow tired of the foolish foolery of the foolish fools of this foolish country... Phoenix: E-Excuse me!? von Karma: Gunpowder burn. Phoenix: ...Gunpowder burn? von Karma: When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole. Gumshoe: Gunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead! Phoenix: (Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...) Gumshoe: But before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Stabbed... And what was he stabbed with? Gumshoe: A fruit knife. Judge: I see. And whose knife was it? Gumshoe: It looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it. Judge: Hmm... All over it, huh? Phoenix: (Urk. This does not look good...) von Karma: Ha ha ha. What will you do now, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Gumshoe: The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How severe was the wound? Gumshoe: If it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand. Phoenix: (This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...) Gumshoe: The murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure he was stabbed first, then shot? Gumshoe: Yup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal. von Karma: A fool is a fool who will only listen to the foolish opinions of other foolish fools... A pistol shot to the forehead at point blank is certainly enough to kill instantly. Does it matter, then, which was first? Think a little more before you open that big mouth of yours, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Grr... What a pain...) Phoenix: (Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...) After pressing first, second, third, and fifth statements: Judge: That's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered. Gumshoe: I brought the two murder weapons with me today. Judge: Very well. The court accepts them into evidence. Pistol added to the Court Record. Knife added to the Court Record. von Karma: The date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time. Judge: And two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them, huh... (Changed from [And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...?] in the original release) Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case. von Karma: Naturally! Phoenix: (This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...) von Karma: Your Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there? Judge: That is quite true... Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Judge: Even in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead \"not guilty\"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose. von Karma: See, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes... Judge: What will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to \"justified self-defense\"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance. Phoenix: (This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!) Plead justified self-defense Phoenix: (If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to \"justified self-defense\"... von Karma: Hah. Judge: Understood. Let the record show that the defense has entered a new plea. Phoenix: (...There's nothing else I could do... Mia...?) Mia: ...You already hold the key... ...If you don't believe, you cannot win... Phoenix: (...! If we plead \"justified self-defense\", we would basically be confessing to murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'll be labeled a murderer... Can I really... Can I really let that happen!?) Your Honor! Judge: Y-Yes? Phoenix: The defense... The defense retracts its previous statement. And instead, will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant is not guilty! Leads to: \"...You.\" Plead not guilty Phoenix: (If we plead \"justified self-defense\"... we would basically be confessing to a murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'd be labeled a murderer... I can't let that happen!) Your Honor! Judge: Have you reached a conclusion, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: The defense will not change its plea. We will accept nothing short of complete acquittal! Leads to: \"...You.\" von Karma: ...You. You have sealed your fate, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Detective! Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! von Karma: Present the final portion of your testimony -- the final strike. Gumshoe: Um... Y-Yes... sir... Judge: N-Now, see here! Proceedings are run by... Eek! von Karma: ... Judge: Oh, yes, of course. Go ahead Detective and give your testimony... von Karma: I think the court would like to hear about the other piece of incriminating evidence! Witness Testimony -- Incriminating Evidence -- Gumshoe: Sorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence. This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime. As you can see, it's covered in blood. The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back. Judge: So this is the costume... There certainly is evidence of a back spray of blood on this. Gumshoe: This piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir. Judge: I see... The court accepts this into evidence. Maya's Costume added to the Court Record. Judge: Alright, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??) von Karma: Hah. What's wrong? You seem to be at a loss. I think this is the last piece of testimony the prosecution should have to offer. Feel free to sulk off with your tail between your legs, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (Please stop calling me by my full name. It's disturbing.) Cross Examination -- Incriminating Evidence -- Gumshoe: Sorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why didn't you say so in your testimony earlier!? Gumshoe: Uh... You're kinda scary today, you know, pal? Judge: Come now, Mr. Wright... There is no need for that kind of attitude in my court... Phoenix: ... Judge: A-Alright. Just, please stop glaring at me like that... Gumshoe: This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Maya's... costume? Gumshoe: Yeah. She was wearing this when we arrested her. Phoenix: (Maya... She's wearing her channeling costume today too... Is she not allowed to wear anything else...?) Gumshoe: As you can see, it's covered in blood. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: This blood on the costume... Gumshoe: Lab results show that it is the victim's blood. Judge: Hmm... So there is blood from the victim on the defendant's clothes. Phoenix: (Definitely not good...) (Changed from [Definitely not good... Urk.] in the original release) So, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence? (Changed from [Hmm, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence?] in the original release) Gumshoe: Um, well... von Karma: von Karma: If you must change the topic, then the good detective here must testify again. But too bad. Not enough time. Let's move on. (Changed from [But too bad. Not enough time. Time to move on.] in the original release) Judge: Ah, yes, Ms. von Karma is perfectly correct... Phoenix: (Grr... Now even the Judge is on her side! But if I bite off more than I can chew here... What should I do!?) Press further Phoenix: (Why is Ms. von Karma suddenly putting up resistance? There must be a reason as to why she suddenly threw out an objection like that... There must be something about this costume...! (Changed from [There must be a clue somewhere on this costume!] in the original release) I just have to look harder!) Judge: Mr. Wright. Ms. von Karma's logic is perfect. There is no way for you to poke a hole in it. Phoenix: (Argh! Looks like my time is up. So, about the costume...) There is nothing wrong. Phoenix: (If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this. Judge: Good. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination There is one little thing... Phoenix: Your Honor. Actually, there is something very wrong with this piece of evidence. Judge: Wh-What!? Gumshoe: What are you talking about, pal!? von Karma: ... Judge: Wh-Where is this problem you are talking about!? Phoenix: (I've come this far... There's no turning back now!) The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here! Present bullet hole on left sleeve Phoenix: Leads to: \"I ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume.\" Present blood splatter Phoenix: Phoenix: The problem is obviously the blood splatter here! Judge: B-But... We've determined that the blood splatter is from the victim. Where is the problem in that? Gumshoe: Yeah, where, pal? Phoenix: Yeah... I wonder about that too... Judge: That last antic of yours just pushed me over the top, Mr. Wright. I hereby declare this cross-examination over... (Changed from [I am declaring that this cross-examination period is over...] in the original release) Phoenix: P-Please wait, Your Honor! (Ack! I'd better not mess up again...) Leads back to: \"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: There is a problem... somewhere around... here! Judge: Wh-What does he mean, Ms. von Karma? von Karma: There's nothing wrong with it. The only thing wrong here is the defense's head. Judge: Well said. You certainly do take after your father! Phoenix: (I've just been made to look like a fool again... Alright... Focus, Phoenix!) Leads back to: \"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\" Phoenix: I ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume. Judge: The sleeve? ...! There is a tiny hole here... Gumshoe: ..A... A hole...? But that wasn't in the report. Judge: Hold on! What's this around the hole? I-It smells faintly of gunpowder! Gumshoe: G-Gunpowder!? No one ever told me! Judge: A hole that smells of gunpowder... Phoenix: (It looks like I've found the \"hole\" I was looking for!) Your Honor, the only logical conclusion you can make is that it must be a bullet hole! Judge: Order! Order! Order!! This is a very grave matter. It's best we correct the Court Record first before anything else. Maya's Costume updated in the Court Record. Gumshoe: Sorry about that. I guess we messed up, sir. von Karma: ... Phoenix: ...! (I-Is she actually... smiling!? What else is she hiding!?) von Karma: Pull yourself together, Detective. That tiny \"hole\" doesn't change a thing. The strength of the evidence still holds. Continue with your testimony. That, just now, was a fluke. Nothing more. Phoenix: Phoenix: H-How can you say something like that!? This is a huge oversight! Judge: While I agree it is a mistake on the part of the police, what Prosecutor von Karma has said is true. The evidence still stands. If you do not find a more definitive problem with the evidence, then... Phoenix: No way!! Judge: Detective Gumshoe, please continue with your testimony. Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir. Leads back to cross-examination Let it go Phoenix: (If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this. Judge: Good. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Alright. I'll give you that the blood spatter is from the victim, but... what is this hole in the sleeve? Gumshoe: Um... Sorry, pal. We must've thought it was just a tear in the seam... Phoenix: Missing the hole is not what I'm asking you about. I'm talking about the hole itself! The smell of gunpowder  clearly gives away that... it is a bullet hole! von Karma: von Karma: As if little things like that matter. Phoenix: But they do. von Karma: A \"bullet hole\" in the sleeve, blood splatter all over the costume... Neither of these things can change the fact the defendant killed the victim. Phoenix: (...Grr... I know there's something more to that costume.) von Karma: Come now Detective. You're wasting precious time. Gumshoe: ... Yes, sir. Gumshoe: The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He wasn't \"fighting back\"? How do you know if he was or wasn't!? Gumshoe: We could find no evidence that the victim put up any sort of struggle, pal. Judge: Hmm... So did the murderer have a fight with the victim, or not? Depending on this, the circumstances around this murder change drastically. Phoenix: (Ugh... We're in real trouble now... If only I had something to prove that the victim did fight back...) Present Maya's Costume (after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Dick Gumshoe!\" Phoenix: (That Von Karma! She thinks she can decide the verdict with this testimony alone! I have to somehow find a critical contradiction and then I'll have her!) Phoenix: Detective Dick Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Y-Yes? Heh, having you call me by my full name is kind of a weird feeling... Phoenix: You said that my client killed \"a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.\" Gumshoe: Yeah, I did. Phoenix: Then what, may I ask, is the bullet hole you police overlooked supposed to mean!? Gumshoe: Eh, um... What does it mean? Phoenix: I'll tell you what it means. It means that the victim had fired off a shot. Is this what it means to \"not fight back\"? Gumshoe: A-Ah! You're right! Judge: It seems you are correct! (Changed from [It would seem that way!] in the original release) If the victim had tried to shoot the defendant, then... it would change everything... (Changed from [If the victim tried to shoot the defendant, then... It would change everything...] in the original release) Phoenix: (Alright! The wind seems to be shifting...) von Karma: Hah. Phoenix: (What is with that \"are you finished yet\" laugh?) von Karma: Are you finished yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Judge: Ms. von Karma? von Karma: It seems... that Maya Fey was shot at by the victim. However, that is only grounds enough to support a \"justified self-defense\" plea. Judge: That is correct. von Karma: But I'm sure you remember, Your Honor, what the defense clearly said. They rejected \"justified self-defense\" and pleaded \"not guilty.\" Phoenix: Ack! Gumshoe: Now that you... Judge: Why, that's right! von Karma: Which means! The defense has yet to prove anything at all! Phoenix: Nooooo!! Judge: W-Well... Yes, that's true... von Karma: Furthermore... just the fact that there is a bullet hole in the costume... is not enough to substantiate even a plea of \"justified self-defense\". Judge: Huh? How so? Gumshoe: Aaah! von Karma: Don't just stand there. Hurry up and tell the court what transpired that day. ...With the new information we acquired added in, of course. Gumshoe: Huh? You mean... By myself...? You want me to put together the scenario all by myself? Aah! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Right away, sir! Witness Testimony -- What Transpired -- Gumshoe: During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest. Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir. While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun. The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed. The defendant then picked up on the opening, took the victim's gun, and ended it... Judge: Hmm... This scenario you have put together does make sense... Gumshoe: Yes, sir. Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (On the surface, it does seem to make sense... (Changed from [Just by listening, it does make sense...] in the original release) However, I won't give up that easily!) Judge: P-Please refrain from glaring at me like that... Now then, your cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- What Transpired -- Gumshoe: During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: There is quite a difference in height between Dr. Grey and the defendant. Add in body strength, and it seems unlikely the defendant could have stabbed the victim! Gumshoe: Now that you mention it... Yeah, I guess... von Karma: von Karma: You think you can get away with such flimsy reasoning? Mr. Phoenix Wright! Maya Fey was in the middle of channeling, was she not? Phoenix: ...? von Karma: When channeling with the Kurain Channeling Technique, the medium physically changes. With the nurse's build, the defendant could have easily been a match for the doctor. Phoenix: (I don't believe it... She even studied up on the Kurain Channeling Technique!) von Karma: Like I said before... I am perfect. Judge: Um... Uh... About what you were talking about... I didn't quite get it... Phoenix: ... von Karma: ... Judge: Um, n-never mind. Let's continue with the testimony... Gumshoe: Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So he was stabbed, but the stab wound didn't kill him. Gumshoe: But if you think about the blood loss, it was pretty bad. Phoenix: How bad would you say it was? Gumshoe: Actually, I went to give blood the other day. And afterward, I felt a little lightheaded and dizzy. ...I guess the damage was maybe... about 10 times the dizziness...? Ack! von Karma: ... Gumshoe: S-Sorry! Gumshoe: While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Where in the world did that pistol come from? Gumshoe: It looks like the victim, Dr. Grey had specifically bought it for that day. Phoenix: But a handgun...? Gumshoe: He got it off the black market about 2 days before the murder. Phoenix: (Why did Dr. Grey bring a gun...? Was he taking precautions against something...?) Gumshoe: The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you're saying that the bullet hole in this costume was made then? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal, but that's what I'd think. The two of them were already fighting when a shot was fired. Phoenix: (Maya... I'm really glad you weren't hurt...) von Karma: ... Present Maya's Costume Phoenix: Leads to: \"Missing the tiny hole on this costume...\" Gumshoe: The defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun, and ended it... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Maya has never fired a gun before in her life! Gumshoe: The victim had already taken off the safety. With the safety off, even an amateur like you can fire it by pulling the trigger. Phoenix: (Even me...? I wonder...?) von Karma: Now do you understand? A Von Karma's logic is perfect. Phoenix: (His testimony certainly makes us look very bad, but there's gotta be a contradiction in there somewhere... And uncovering it is going to uncover the truth! I can feel it!) Phoenix: Missing the tiny hole on this costume... will be the prosecution's undoing. Gumshoe: Eh? What do you mean? Phoenix: This little hole has actually created a huge hole in your testimony! Judge: E-Explain yourself, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: You said the two of them were fighting when the victim fired his gun at point blank. If that were true, then where is the gunpowder burn on this costume!? Gumshoe: G-Gunpowder... burn? Phoenix: This is what you testified earlier: \"When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\" Gumshoe: OH! Phoenix: But there is not a single trace of gunpowder burn on this costume!! Judge: That is a very good point. And... what exactly does this mean? Phoenix: It means that when the shot was fired, they were standing apart from each other. Judge: Hmm... von Karma: von Karma: I'm disappointed, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You think you can punch a hole in my logic with that? With wishy-washy thinking like that, anyone can explain anything away! Phoenix: Then I implore you to disprove my line of thinking. von Karma: Let's see... In the middle of their fight, the victim pushed the defendant away. And it was then, when they were separated, that he fired! How was that? Phoenix: Phoenix: As if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that! von Karma: ...! W-Well... Then... That's right! The defendant must have pushed the victim away! After stabbing him, she must have put some space between the doctor and herself. And then while she was preparing to strike again, the doctor took his shot. There. That sound satisfy even you. Judge: Hmm... That does make an awful lot of sense. What do you think, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (I must be careful. I can't afford to make a mistake here! Concentrate and think!) It makes sense. Phoenix: (Ack, it's no good. I can't find a \"hole\" in her logic at all this time...) I admit it. Somehow, your reasoning makes logical sense. von Karma: That's it. That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Drat. It's 11:00 AM. I've already missed my morning tea. ...However. At least we were able to arrive at a conclusion. Judge: Hmm... It does look that way. Phoenix: (...Oh boy... If I don't do something soon, it'll be curtains for Maya...) Judge: Well then, I think we can... Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! Please... Wait! Judge: Who was that? Mr. Wright? Please refrain from making unnecessary outbursts! Phoenix: (I don't care how, but I must find something to go on in Von Karma's explanation!) Leads to: \"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\" Something doesn't make sense. Leads to: \"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\" Phoenix: There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor! Gumshoe: Fatal...? Judge: Flaw...!? Yeow! von Karma: Very interesting. I would love to see where this \"flaw\" is! Show me something that contradicts my explanation! Phoenix: (There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere! \"She put some distance between them before rushing to make the final blow. And when she was about to strike, the doctor took his shot.\" There must be a piece of evidence that contradicts this line of thinking!) Present Folding Screen Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Take a look at this! Gumshoe: Why are you showing this to me, pal? Phoenix: Prosecutor von Karma's explanation and this piece of evidence... Gumshoe: ...Do not contradict! Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: Haha, looks like you need to use your brain a little more, pal. Phoenix: (Ugh... Being lectured by Gumshoe, of all people, is so embarrassing...) Gumshoe: Come on! Hurry up and get that thinking cap on! Leads back to: \"There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere!\" Phoenix: This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic. Judge: What is that? A folding screen? Phoenix: I would like to point the court's attention to the \"hole\" in this folding screen. von Karma: Aaah! Phoenix: It looks like you already know what I'm talking about. Gumshoe: Who? Where? What? Judge: Mr. Wright! Your explanation, please! Phoenix: (Are these two really that clueless...?) The bullet went through the defendant's sleeve first, then the folding screen. It passed through at a height of approximately 8 inches off the ground... Which means! When the shot was fired, Maya... I mean, the defendant, was not getting ready to strike, but was actually squatting low to the ground! Judge: Order! Order! Th-This changes everything! Phoenix: Please look at this diagram of the crime scene. The victim, Dr. Grey was here when he fired the shot. And the bullet hit this folding screen. It hit at this location, about 8 inches off the ground. At this time, the defendant was in this area. Present area directly in front of bullet hole Phoenix: Leads to: \"She was standing here, near the folding screen!\" Present area behind folding screen Phoenix: Phoenix: Here! Judge: Behind the folding screen...? Phoenix: Ack! von Karma: The victim and his attacker were fighting, were they not? Then what would the attacker be doing all the way back there!? Phoenix: Um... von Karma: Besides which, if the attacker was behind the folding screen, then how could the victim even know where to shoot? It's obviously impossible! Phoenix: ... Yeah, I guess so... Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Boy, did I just screw up royally... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.) Leads back to: \"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: Somewhere around here! Judge: ...? Phoenix: (Uh oh. The judge's face is scrunched like he just smelled some serious bad breath...) Uhh... Um... That is, I mean... Judge: Wait! I just realized I forgot to brush this morning... Excuse me while I freshen up. Phoenix: Uh, sure... Judge: In the meantime, I want you to think things through again, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Ah, of course... Whoops... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.) Leads back to: \"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\" Phoenix: She was standing here, near the folding screen! von Karma: W-Wait a second! We know the defendant was close to the ground based on the height of the bullet hole. But... How can you gauge the distance from that!? Isn't it possible that the defendant was standing much closer to the victim? Phoenix: That's impossible. von Karma: B-But why!? Phoenix: You, of all people, should know the answer to that question, Ms. von Karma. If she were shot from somewhere closer, there would be gunpowder burns present. However! There is nothing of the sort around the bullet hole of this costume! von Karma: Aaaaaah! C-Curse you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You...! Judge: Hmm... I believe it has now been proven that the defendant was standing a ways from the victim when she was shot at. But do you think this has changed the defendant's situation...? It doesn't change anything. Phoenix: (Hmm, even with that explanation, it feels like nothing has changed... But I can't give up just yet!) Leads to: \"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\" It changes everything. Leads to: \"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\" Phoenix: Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything! The prosecution has claimed that the defendant was aiming to kill by stabbing. If that were true, delivering the final strike with the knife would be ideal. However! Where and what was the defendant doing at the time...? Gumshoe: ...Squatting all the way by the folding screen...? Phoenix: Exactly. If Maya Fey was the real murderer, why would she be by the folding screen instead of preparing to strike? von Karma: Nnngh... Judge: Upon further consideration, it does make very little sense. Gumshoe: Yeah, I figured there had to be a reason. Phoenix: Figuring things out and proving the logic behind everything is YOUR job! Gumshoe: Oof... Phoenix: (Alright! With this, the rest of the trial should be in the b--) von Karma: ... Phoenix: (...blast radius of disaster.) von Karma: You are such a smart man, Mr. Phoenix Wright. To think that you've been able to take a completely hopeless case to this point... Now I know why Papa had a tough time with you. Mmm, you amuse me... Phoenix: (Uuugh. Of all the things to inherit, why did it have to be that smarmy smile!?) von Karma: Detective. How dare you damage my perfect logic!? Gumshoe: H-Huh!?... How is it all my fault?? von Karma: You can start repairing your standing by first removing that three-strand \"goatee\". Oh, and rest assured your punishment will come later. Gumshoe: ...P-Punishment... von Karma: Well then, Your Honor, I think I've had all I can take of this detective's face. I think it's time to call in the next witness. Phoenix: (Next witness...? That's gotta be Lotta!) Judge: Very well. The court will take a 5 minute recess. After we reconvene, we will hear from the next witness. To be continued. June 21, 11:37 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Phoenix: Phew, that was a close one. Maya: I know you were giving it your all to defend me. But I could feel the death penalty hanging in the air... Phoenix: I felt like I was pretty close to dying myself... Pearl: But you were wonderful out there. You listened carefully, made theories, and tricked everyone into believing you. Phoenix: Th-Thanks. Wait... Tricked?? Pearl: That must be the \"lawyer's\" secret technique, right? Maya: By the way... Is the next witness who I think it is...? Phoenix: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's Lotta Hart. Maya: Oh... Guess there's no escaping her, huh? (Changed from [Oh... Another jam, like always...] in the original release) Remember, Nick! You promised you'd save me! If you lose, me and my sis's ghosts will come after you and haunt you! (Changed from [If you lose, my ghost will come after you with my sis', and we'll haunt you!] in the original release) Pearl: Your sister...? Um, are you talking about Mystic Mia? Maya: Yeah. Do you remember her, Pearly? My sister was a super good lawyer! She was also Nick's teacher. Pearl: ...Oh, I didn't know that... June 21, 11:43 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2 Judge: Court will now reconvene. Now, the first order of... Oww! von Karma: I don't want to hear it, old man. After I call my witness, sit there quietly and watch like a good little boy. Judge: Y-Yes, sir. von Karma: Bring in the photographer who witnessed the channeling! von Karma: Witness. Your name and occupation, if you please. Lotta: Hey, Phoenix! How ya doin'? Phoenix: Just fine... Lotta: Sorry 'bout this. Didn't exactly have a choice, ya know...? Yeowza! von Karma: Name and occupation. Lotta: I-I declare! What in tarnation!? Hey, Judge! This here is violence against my fair self! Judge: That's fine. Lotta: \"That's fine!?\" That ain't fine!! That's a whip! Eaaah! von Karma: There's no need for foolish outcries from foolishly foolish fools. Just hurry up and testify about what happened on the day of the murder. Lotta: I haven't even gotten to say my name and job yet... von Karma: ... Lotta: The name's Lotta Hart, paranormal photographer, and I'm here to testify! Judge: Now, now, let's all be one big happy family... OK...? Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- Lotta: Only the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber. We were waitin' outside the door and then, \"bang!\" we hear this gunshot! Mr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room. Inside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around. I swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room. Judge: And did you take a picture of the scene right after the murder took place? Lotta: Reckon course! Phoenix: Eh? ...Excuse me? Lotta: Reckon course! It's short for \"Ya reckon!? Of course I did!\" Aah! von Karma: Does it look like I care? Just hurry up and show your picture to the court. Phoenix: (The moment of truth. What will be in that picture?) Lotta: Umm, let's see here... This here's the picture! Judge: Hmm... It would certainly seem that only the defendant and the victim were in that room. Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record. von Karma: Are you ready, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: (I will clear all doubt about Maya through this cross-examination... Just watch me!) Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- Lotta: Only the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was it really only those two that went in!? von Karma: von Karma: What are you blabbering about!? You were there too, were you not!? Phoenix: Urk. von Karma: Why don't you answer that yourself? Was it really just the two of them? Phoenix: ...Yes. Dr. Grey and Maya were the only two who went into the room... Judge: H-Hold on! We can't have the defense testifying against its own client! Lotta: Anyway, folks, only the two of 'em went into the Channelin' Chamber, ya hear? von Karma: But you knew that from the very beginning, didn't you? ...Witness, continue. Lotta: We were waitin' outside the door and then, \"bang!\" we hear this gunshot! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was it really a gunshot!? von Karma: von Karma: Are you insane!? You must have heard it as well! Phoenix: Urk. von Karma: Why don't you testify for the court, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Was it really a gunshot? Phoenix: ...Yes. I think it was something that sounded like a gunshot... Judge: And why are we here listening to the defense testify!? Phoenix: (...And the world becomes just a little crueler...) Lotta: I heard a gunshot a long time ago, so I know. And I tell ya that was a gunshot I heard. Now, this -- this is where the story heats up! Lotta: Mr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, let me get this straight! This \"Mr. Lawyer there\" broke the door down!? von Karma: Honestly, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Why don't you tell us what happened, then? Phoenix: Um... Yes, Ms. von Karma... I broke the door down. Sorry. (Why does this feel like an inquisition?) Lotta: No need for apologizin'! That was great! You're a real man! Judge: Oh, really? That's something I would've liked to see. Phoenix: (The judge is smiling rather openly. I'll take that as a good sign...) von Karma: And? What did you see once you broke in? Lotta: Inside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure it was the defendant, Maya Fey!? Lotta: Sure, I'm sure! Phoenix: (Lotta seems awful confident in her testimony...) Press harder Phoenix: Lotta! Please, think back to that day one more time. Lotta: Wh-Whatcha getting' at? Phoenix: Remember what you said when we broke into the room...? ???: ...I was... murdered... *klik* Phoenix: Lotta! At a time like this!? Lotta: Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!? Phoenix: When you saw the murderer at that time, you couldn't even tell if it was Maya Fey or not! Am I correct!? Lotta: Ah, um, well, ya see... Judge: Order! Ms. Hart! You are here to present accurate testimony! Lotta: Yeah, ah, s-sorry. Phoenix: (Good. This shifts things back to my side...) von Karma: For a defense lawyer, your defense is terribly lacking, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: ! von Karma: Witness. Think back to when those two entered the Channeling Chamber. Lotta: When they entered...? von Karma: One of those people that entered the chamber was Maya Fey, correct? Lotta: Yeah, that's right! Phoenix: (Yeah... It was Maya that went in.) Judge: Hmm... It looks like we've come to a collective conclusion. The person in this picture is most certainly Maya Fey. von Karma: Exactly. Phoenix: (Rats! And I'm trapped like one... Again!) Leads back to cross-examination Leave her be Phoenix: (Even I can see that any normal person would know who that was. It's no good. I shouldn't push my luck on this...) Leads back to cross-examination Lotta: I swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain of that!? Lotta: Sure am! But that old witch chased us out of the room, so... Phoenix: (\"Old witch\"? Does she mean Morgan Fey?) Lotta: But there was no one else in there, and you know it! Phoenix: (The Channeling Chamber was very dark, almost pitch black... Was there really no one else in there? What about...?) behind the folding screen? Phoenix: What about... behind the folding screen? Did you check back there? Lotta: Reckgiven! Phoenix: Huh? What in the...? Lotta: Reckgiven! Ya know! \"Ya reckon!? That's a given!\" I took me a good look around the room once! There ain't no way anyone was hangin' out behind that foldin' screen! Judge: Hmm... If I may have a word with you, Ms. Hart... Lotta: Wh-What? Ya got a problem!? Judge: Reckgiven!... I mean, I am having a little difficulty in understanding you. If you would stop saying such things as \"Reckongiven\" and so forth... Aah! von Karma: Now then, Mr. Phoenix Wright, do you see a problem with the testimony or don't you? Leads back to cross-examination behind the door? Phoenix: What about... behind the door? Did you check there? Lotta: What do I look like to you? I wasn't born yesterday, ya know! First off, the one that bust that door open was you! With the way ya slammed that door, anyone standin' behind it woulda had more face and less nose, free of charge! von Karma: In any case, there was no one standing behind the door. Phoenix: (She actually had the police investigate that too!?) Leads back to cross-examination under the flooring? Phoenix: What about... under the flooring? Did you check there? Lotta: I ain't no ignoramus to make it out here! Phoenix: Huh?... Wh-What are you talking about? Lotta: Don't \"what are ya talkin' about\" me! Under the floorin'? C'mon!, even a bug wouldn't crawl under that! von Karma: Sorry to disappoint, but there was no secret passageway under the flooring. Phoenix: (Oh... Yeah, that was a bit far-fetched, huh...?) Leads back to cross-examination Phoenix: (Argh! Her story adds up... What's worse, I was there at the scene of the crime with her... (Changed from [What's worse is that I was there at the scene of the crime at that time too,] in the original release) and her story is exactly how I would have told it, too... (Changed from [and her story is exactly how I would have told it...] in the original release)) After pressing all statements: Phoenix: (Argh! Just as I thought, there is nothing wrong with her testimony! I was with her, so I know she's telling the truth...) Judge: Enough. It seems that there are no issues with Ms. Hart's testimony. von Karma: At the time of the crime, only two people were in the Channeling Chamber: the victim, Dr. Turner Grey, and the defendant, Maya Fey. Judge: Hmm... The face of the defendant can not be verified in this picture. However, if we think about the circumstances, it would have to be the defendant. Phoenix: (What am I going to do!? If I just let this go...) Judge: What is it, Mr. Wright? You look as if you have something to say... Phoenix: (If I make one wrong move, I'm going to have the judge against me... Is there anything I can present that would prove it's not Maya in that photo?) Present evidence Phoenix: Your Honor! Judge: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: It is possible that the person in this photo is not the defendant! Judge: Wh-Wh-What!? Do you know what you are proposing!? Lotta: Y-Y-Yeah! That's just plain fool's talk! Phoenix: (Thanks guys. Your show of support was just great...) von Karma: ... Judge: ...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof. Prove to this court that the person in this photo is not Maya Fey! Present anything Phoenix: Phoenix: Here is your proof! von Karma: von Karma: ... Phoenix: Is there a problem? von Karma: Oh, no. I thought I would work on my inflections. Just wondering what an \"Objection!\" with a twist of \"You're wrong!\" sounds like. Judge: Mr. Wright. I'm sorry, but I don't follow your logic. Phoenix: (Shoot. I guess I wasn't showing enough confidence...) Present another piece Leads back to: \"...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof.\" Give up Leads to: \"Well, Mr. Wright?\" Can't present anything yet Leads to: \"Well, Mr. Wright?\" Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Nothing, Your Honor... von Karma: That's very smart of you, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You really should give up trying to prove this is not Maya Fey. Phoenix: (I didn't say anything about giving up! I just don't have the right piece of evidence to prove my argument...) Judge: That's enough! Phoenix: (I-Is this it...? Is this all I could do...?) Judge: I think it is quite obvious to this court that a verdict of not guilty is not possible. von Karma: I told you. Totally, 100% impossible. Judge: Ms. von Karma, do you have any further questions for this witness? von Karma: Having established the defendant's guilt, further questioning won't be needed. Judge: What about the defense? No further questions, I presume? Phoenix: (I... I couldn't protect Maya...) The defense... The defense... ...Phoenix... ...Phoenix, you can't make that kind of face... ...A lawyer is someone who smiles... no matter how bad it gets!... Phoenix: M-Mia! Mia: I guess I made it just in time, wouldn't you say? Phoenix: Y-You... But... P-Pearls! Mia: Her clothes ARE a bit small... Anyway, what are you waiting for, Phoenix!? Let's go! Phoenix: B-But how!? She's already taken away every advantage! Mia: The advantage is still in your hand! Think carefully, one more time, about what you saw in the Channeling Chamber. Do you remember what you told me yesterday? Phoenix: D-Dr. Grey!! *klik* ???: ...I was... murdered... Phoenix: W-What!? *klik* Phoenix: Lotta! At a time like this!? Lotta: Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! Mia: You see... There is one final piece to this puzzle. (Changed from [You see... There is one final piece of the puzzle.] in the original release) Phoenix: Mia...? Mia: Question Lotta one more time, Phoenix. I don't know if she's doing it unconsciously or on purpose, but... (Changed from [I don't know if she's doing it subconsciously or on purpose, but...] in the original release) she's not testifying truthfully. Judge: Now then, this court would like to end the cross-examination period. Phoenix: Phoenix: Please wait, Your Honor! The defense would like to request that the witness testify one more time. Judge: Overruled. I'm afraid you're too late, Mr. Wright. The cross-examination has already ended. Furthermore, any unrelated ques- Aah! von Karma: It's fine. I'll allow another testimony. A Von Karma's case is perfect. Absolutely flawless. And what better time than this for you to see that. Judge: B-But... I mean... I have some place I must go after this... Mmph! A-Al-Alright! I'll allow it! Ms. Hart! Hurry and give us another testimony! Lotta: Well... heck... What am I supposed to talk about? Phoenix: Please tell us once more, what happened when you burst into the Channeling Chamber. Lotta: OK! You got it! Mia: See, you got through to the judge somehow, right? Phoenix: (Well, actually it was Von Karma's whip that got through to him...) Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account, Pt. 2 -- Lotta: When we broke into that room, all I could focus on was Maya. I was... uh, kinda scared of the dead body, so I didn't take a good look at it. I'm really bad when it comes to blood and ghosts and stuff. But I still managed to point my camera at Maya and take a shot! Judge: Nothing sounds different from before... Phoenix: (Some parts of her testimony were very vague. I should press her on those sections!) von Karma: Struggle all you like as you taste the bitterness of your defeat. Well, amuse me with your useless questions, Mr. Phoenix Wright. I'm waiting... Cross Examination -- Witness' Account, Pt.2 -- Lotta: When we broke into that room, all I could focus on was Maya. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, what did she look like? Lotta: Ya know, she looked almost like a different person. Judge: A... A different person? von Karma: She may have seemed like a different person, however, she was still Maya Fey. We have already made that point abundantly clear! Judge: Yes, that is true... Well, then, Ms. Hart. Did you happen to see anything else? Lotta: I was... uh, kinda scared of the dead body, so I didn't take a good look at it. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Then perhaps that body was not Dr. Grey's at all! Lotta: Eh!? W-Well... I reckon that's possible... von Karma: von Karma: If the body inside that room was not that of Dr. Grey, then whose body was it, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Phoenix: Well, what if it was that of Maya Fey after the channeling? Or maybe -- Oww! von Karma: Foolish fool spouting foolish foolishness, just as I expect of a foolish fool such as you. If that were the case, then that would mean that Maya Fey is, in fact, dead. And that would make the defendant's chair quite a lonely place, wouldn't it!? Phoenix: (Urk... Sorry, Maya...) Lotta: Are y'all done here? Can I continue? Lotta: I'm really bad when it comes to blood and ghosts and stuff. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And even knowing that, you still persist in being a paranormal photographer? Lotta: That's why I'm getting out of this here business. This gal's gonna get the dirt on the stars and be a tabloid photographer from now on! Phoenix: (She goes through jobs faster than a baby through diapers.) Wah! von Karma: Mr. Phoenix Wright. Would it kill you to stay on topic for a change? Judge: Well? Would it, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (Nice, tag-teamed in stereo. Guess I should be grateful it's not in 5.1...) Lotta: But I still managed to point my camera at Maya and take a shot! Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"Two, right?\" Mia: There must be something we can use in her testimony just now. We must find it! At all costs... Phoenix: Two, right? Lotta: T-Two what? Phoenix: Two shots. You took two shots. Judge: But... Only one has been submitted as evidence! Phoenix: Ms. Hart! Where is the other picture you have been withholding!? Lotta: No, no, no! You've got it all wrong! It's not me! I-I didn't mean anything bad! I know I can be a little mean, but I ain't evil! Phoenix: (Well, at least she knows herself...) Judge: Then why have you not shown this \"other picture\" to this court yet? Lotta: Well, ain't it obvious!? That prosecutor woman told me to shut my trap about it! Phoenix: W-What!? V... Von Karma!! Judge: M-M-Ms. von Karma! Y-Y-You... You're hiding critical evidence...! von Karma: ... Phoenix: (Unforgivable, von Karma. Suppressing evidence like this... You're as bad as your father!) Confront Franziska Phoenix: Your Honor! The defense asks that Prosecutor von Karma be held in contempt of court! Judge: Hmm... Well, yes... Mngh! von Karma: Me? In contempt of court!? You can't be serious. Phoenix: But... But you hid evidence from the court... On purpose! That's... That's... That's not fair! Mia: P-Phoenix!! Are you a lawyer or a school child? Phoenix: (Ack! I was so angry I lost my composure...) Leads to: \"Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?\" Leave it to the Judge Phoenix: (...Argh! I'm so mad that even my throat's clenching up! I'd better let the Judge handle this...) Leads to: \"Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?\" Judge: Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court? von Karma: I thought this picture was not important, and thus, felt no need to submit it. That's all. Phoenix: H-How could you think...!? von Karma: The pictures were more or less the same, so why bother with the second? I mean, it's just so much more trouble than it's worth for me to submit this as evidence. Phoenix: \"M-More trouble that [sic] it's worth!?\" How... How can you say that!? von Karma: If you want to see it that badly, I'll submit it. Lotta's Photo 2 added to the Court Record. Judge: ... Wh-What is...? What is this picture!? von Karma: It's obviously the second picture the witness took that day at the scene of the crime. Well, it's a little off-center, but that's what you get with a nervous amateur. Judge: Um... I think the important point here is the person in this picture! (Changed from [Well, I think the important point here is the person in this picture!] in the original release) This is most definitely NOT Maya Fey! What is the meaning of this!? Phoenix: (This might be the break I was looking for... Now, should I or should I not insist that the person in this picture is not Maya?) Drop the issue Phoenix: ... (It's no good. We've been through this so many times...) Judge: This is not like you, Mr. Wright! Why are you not objecting!? The person in this photo is clearly not the defendant and yet... von Karma: Ha ha ha... There is no way he can raise an objection and hope to live. Judge: Explain yourself! Leads to: \"Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture.\" Insist it's not Maya Phoenix: Your Honor! As you can plainly see, the person in the picture is not Maya Fey! Judge: Y-Yes, I see that... It's not just her face! Her whole body has taken on a different appearance! Phoenix: There is only one conclusion that can be drawn, then. That somehow, this other person snuck in and traded places with the defendant! Judge: Order! Order! Order!! Well, yes, I believe you are correct, Mr. Wright! The person who was inside the Channeling Chamber was not Maya Fey! Phoenix: Mia! We did it! Mia: ...You're too soft. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: You're softer than Aunt Morgan's strawberry desserts, Phoenix. Take a look at Prosecutor von Karma's face. Phoenix: (S-She's... smiling...!?) von Karma: I think you had better continue to worry, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Judge: M-Ms. von Karma! What do you mean by that? Leads to: \"Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture.\" von Karma: Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture. This was taken yesterday at the Detention Center's Visitor's Room. This is Mr. Phoenix Wright and the defendant, Maya Fey during his visit... Judge: Maya Fey? But... Isn't this a totally different person!? von Karma: She looks this way because she is obviously in the middle of channeling a spirit! Judge: It's unbelievable... That she can... von Karma: Yet, it is the truth. (Changed from [However, it is true.] in the original release) When Maya Fey is in that state, she physically changes into the person she's calling! Judge: ... Mia: Ms. von Karma. A word, if I may. (Changed from [I wonder if she knows what she's doing...] in the original release) Phoenix: (M-Mia!?) (Question mark not present in the original release) Mia: Taking pictures of someone during a private visit is illegal. Surely, you must know that that picture can't be submitted as evidence. (Changed from [That picture can't be submitted as evidence.] in the original release) von Karma: ... Obviously, I know this picture is illegal. (Changed from [Obviously, this picture is illegal.] in the original release) But I never intended to submit it as evidence in the first place! Phoenix: (Wh-What is she...?) von Karma: From the moment I showed this picture to the court, this case became all mine. After all, this image has now been forever burned into the judge's mind. Judge: ... Phoenix: (I... I don't have even a single witty line...) Mia: It looks like we've been had. Judge: I don't claim to understand this, and I still cannot believe it... Are you saying that this person... this person is the defendant, Maya Fey!? Phoenix: (If I give up here, the trial will end! But... If I slip up and say something wrong, it will cost me... Is there any way I can prove that the person in this picture is not Maya!?) I can't prove it. Phoenix: (It's no good! My argument doesn't hold any water!) Judge: I see the defense is staying silent on this one. Phoenix: ...Yes... Your Honor... von Karma: And to think. I even gave you this chance to prove your point for free. But you couldn't even point yourself out in a line-up! Judge: Hmm... Yes... Well, then. I believe we have reached a conclusion. Mia: Phoenix! Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: You can't give up! Please, for me? Take a look at the Court Record again and try to find some way out of this jam! Phoenix: Yeah... Some way... Mia: The judge is about to close the trial. You can't let that happen! Phoenix: (Argh... It's come down to this!) Your Honor! Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now. Judge: What is it, now, Mr. Wright!? Phoenix: Please! Please let me explain! Leads to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" I can prove it. Phoenix: Your Honor! Judge: Oh! The fire has returned to your eyes, I see. Phoenix: This picture... Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now. Judge: A contradiction!? Leads to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" von Karma: So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep. Why don't you point out exactly what is so strange in this picture for the court? Present bottom of cuff on left sleeve Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please direct your attention here!\" Present face Phoenix: Phoenix: Please direct your attention here! Judge: ...T-To her... face? Phoenix: With your own two eyes, you can clearly see that this face does not belong to Maya Fey! von Karma: von Karma: Fool! Do you even know what you're talking about anymore!? Phoenix: AAAH! THAT HURT! von Karma: Didn't we just finish discussing that her appearance changes during channeling!? Lotta: I know you ain't no dummy, so don't think yer foolin' no one here! Judge: There is a limit to everything, Mr. Wright. And that includes patience! Mia: Phoenix! You have to think before you speak! You can't just blurt out any old thing. Maya: ...Nick! You're supposed to be helping me! Phoenix: (*cringe* Even Maya's mad at me now... I have to focus!) Leads back to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: The contradiction lies... Here! Judge: ...You don't sound very sure of yourself, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Excuse me, but can you really tell me how much confidence I have in this!? von Karma: Hmph! What is with that attitude!? Phoenix: AAAH! THAT HURT! von Karma: Didn't we just finish discussing that her appearance changes during channeling!? Lotta: I know you ain't no dummy, so don't think yer foolin' no one here! Judge: There is a limit to everything, Mr. Wright. And that includes patience! Mia: Phoenix! You have to think before you speak! You can't just blurt out any old thing. Maya: ...Nick! You're supposed to be helping me! Phoenix: (*cringe* Even Maya's mad at me now... I have to focus!) Leads back to: \"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\" Phoenix: Please direct your attention here! Judge: ...T-To the sleeve? But... But there isn't anything odd about it... Phoenix: And that is exactly what is so odd. Something that should be there is suddenly missing. von Karma: \"Should be there\"...? Aaaaah! Phoenix: There was a bullet hole in the sleeve of the defendant's costume! If that's the case, then it should be in this picture as well! Judge: Ms. von Karma!! Y-You... You intended to hide this valuable piece of evidence!? von Karma: ... Judge: You will most certainly be assigned a penalty for this! Phoenix: (Alright. This should do some major damage to her argument...) Mia: Don't celebrate yet. Phoenix: You like to bring down the mood, don't you? Mia: Take a look at Ms. von Karma's face. Phoenix: (Argh! She's got that condescending grin plastered all over her face again.) von Karma: ...Tsk, tsk, jumping the gun again, I see. Your Honor! I would like to extend an apology on behalf of those incompetent fools. Judge: Wh-What do you mean? And what \"incompetent fools\"...? von Karma: If those fools down at the precinct hadn't missed the bullet hole, I would have gotten a report about it. As I didn't, I could not have known that this picture was of any value to this case. Judge: Hmm, I see... Phoenix: (She's lying through her teeth! I know it! That woman knew about everything! The bullet hole, the picture -- everything!) Mia: But you can't prove that. Franziska von Karma's idea of a \"perfect case\" is quite fascinating, don't you think? von Karma: Your Honor. You need not worry. If you must assign a penalty, I'll personally make sure that detective gets what's coming. I'm sure there will be a great gnashing of teeth at the next salary discussion. Phoenix: (Poor Gumshoe...) Judge: In any case, this is a very big problem! When the defendant was taken into custody, her costume had a bullet hole in its sleeve. However, from this photo, it would appear that right after the shooting, there was none! von Karma: ... Mia: The judge is confused by this strange twist of events. This is your chance, Phoenix! Load all you've got into this one shot, alright!? Phoenix: Got it! (Watch this, Maya!) Your Honor! There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction! This picture is a fake. Phoenix: The fact that the defendant's costume has a bullet hole in its sleeve is a fact! Which can only mean one thing. That this picture is a fake! Judge: Wh-What!? Lotta: Hey! You callin' me a forger now!? Phoenix: Well, no, not you exactly... Well, not per se... Lotta: Oh no ya don't! Don't you be scratchin' yer head with that goofy smile like some monkey! Now, why do ya think I'd do somethin' that nasty!? C'mon now! Mia: Phoenix! Use your brain for a change! Phoenix: S-Sorry, Chief... Leads back to: \"There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!\" The bullet hole was made later. Phoenix: There is only one explanation for why there is no hole in the sleeve in the picture! The hole was created much later, after the murder took place! Judge: A-After the murder!? Lotta: Hey! Those two gunshots we heard were before we broke in, or did ya forget!? Phoenix: Hmm... I-Is that how it went? von Karma: The pistol fired only two shots. No more, no less. Judge: You do know how to count, right? Mia: Phoenix! What are you doing!? Try it one more time! Phoenix: Y-Yes, Chief... Leads back to: \"There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!\" The shooter is someone else. Leads to: \"The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it.\" Phoenix: The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it. However, this person clearly does not. There can be only one explanation. The person who shot Dr. Grey was not the defendant, but a different person altogether! von Karma: Wha-Whaaaat!? Judge: Order! Order! Order! If order is not restored, I will suspend this trial! Oww! Phoenix: Aah! Lotta: Why me!? von Karma: The defense's... The defense's argument is a complete mess! Phoenix: A complete mess? I fail to see how! Please, enlighten us. von Karma: Hey, witness! Lotta: Aah! What the heck!? Is that any way to ask a gal a favor!? von Karma: Be quiet you! You were the one who said it was only the two of them when you entered the room! Lotta: Well, ya know... von Karma: If you were lying, I swear that my whip will be the last thing you see! Lotta: L-Look, sis... You're lookin' mighty scary so why don't we say you... Waah! I-I swear! I wasn't lyin' or nothin'! There wasn't anyone else in there! Honest! von Karma: You see! Now riddle me this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Where did the defendant vanish to!? And where did this other woman appear from!? Phoenix: Umm... (Why is it lately, all I want to do is cry...?) Judge: Well, if the person in this picture is not the defendant, then this poses 2 very big questions. First, where did the defendant vanish to, and second, where did this person come from? von Karma: That's right! Now hurry up and answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Mia: Come on! You can't fall apart here, Phoenix Wright! Phoenix: (I can't believe that even Mia's calling me by my full name... But... I mean... How am I supposed to prove something like this!?) von Karma: Had enough yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Or do you think you have enough in you to turn things around even now!? Phoenix: (To \"turn things around\"... That's right. Mia would always turn things around and change her perspective!) Mia: Phoenix...? Phoenix: (So, where did this intruder appear from, and where did Maya disappear to? I need to look at this situation from a different angle! Let's see... What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room... And what if Maya had left that room somehow... If I could prove that either one of those conditions were true...) Judge: Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you've come up with. Phoenix: I think what happened before we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber is... a 3rd person had entered it. Phoenix: Your Honor! I would like to present some evidence! I have proof that there was someone else in the room before the murder took place! Present anything Phoenix: Phoenix: Please take a good look at this! Judge: ...Okay... von Karma: I've already seen it. Phoenix: Thank you. Judge: And? What is the purpose of this item? Phoenix: Don't you see, Your Honor? von Karma: I don't think you actually see what you are doing. Phoenix: ... *sigh* Judge: I think it is the court that should be sighing at you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ouch, that stung...) Present another piece Leads back to: \"Your Honor! I would like to present some evidence!\" Think it over again Phoenix: (I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...) Leads back to: \"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\" Maya had left the room. Phoenix: Maya had left the Channeling Chamber at some point! And the defense can prove this! von Karma: Oh, how a foolish fool makes a foolish face while dreaming foolishly foolish dreams. Maya Fey was being looked after by her aunt, Morgan Fey. The chances of her leaving the crime scene is lower than that detective's salary! Judge: Anyway, let's see some evidence. Prove that from the murder until the time of arrest, the defendant had left the room. Present Black Key Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key?\" Present anything else Phoenix: The evidence you're looking for is... this? Judge: ... Lotta: Why the heck is there a \"?\" at the end there for!? Phoenix: Well, actually, I'm not really sure about this evidence, you know...? Judge: Next time, only present evidence you actually do have faith in. Phoenix: (Oww... That burned...) Present another piece Leads back to: \"Anyway, let's see some evidence.\" Think it over again Phoenix: (I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...) Leads back to: \"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\" something I can't explain yet. Phoenix: I'm sorry, but I simply can't. von Karma: Y-You see!? And the reason is quite simple. Because there is no explanation. That's why! Judge: Hmm... As I thought. Another big waste of this court's time. Mia: Phoenix! You can't just give up like that! Phoenix: But Mia! Mia: Rethink things one more time! There has to be an explanation! von Karma: I'm already \"perfect\". So of course, my conclusions are also \"perfect\". Phoenix: (Grr... Alright, Wright. Calm down and let's try this one more time!) Leads back to: \"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\" Phoenix: Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key? Lotta: Um... Well, I've seen it... Hey! That's the Channeling Chamber key, right? Before the channeling started, Maya locked the door from the inside with that... von Karma: The defendant herself locked the door...? Lotta: Yeah! That's why we all couldn't get the door open. That key's the only one of its kind, after all. Judge: Oh... One of a kind, you say? von Karma: ...! Wait... Mr. Phoenix Wright... Phoenix: Yes? (It looks like she's catching on...) von Karma: I'm afraid to ask, but... Why is that key currently in your possession? Judge: Huh? What do you mean? Phoenix: If Maya Fey locked herself in, then the key should have been with her. Judge: Yes, agreed. Phoenix: However, she did not have the key at the time of her arrest! Lotta: Aah! Well, ain't that a kick! So how come you're holdin' it!? Phoenix: I got this as a present from a certain little girl. And that little girl was nowhere near the crime scene at the time! von Karma: Th-Th-That's preposterous! Phoenix: This means that Maya Fey must have left the room! If she had not, then I would not be holding this key you see before you! von Karma: N-Nooooooo! Judge: It seems we have come to an impasse. This picture has clearly captured the face of the murderer. However, is this person the defendant or not? The defense is arguing that this person is not the defendant. Furthermore, as proof, this key has been submitted as evidence. Ms. von Karma. von Karma: How. Can. This. Be!? Judge: At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant's guilt is not possible. (Changed from [At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant is not possible.] in the original release) von Karma: My perfect case! How is there a flaw in my perfect case! Don't think you've won yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright! I am a prodigy! I have never lost a case! And I don't intend to lose here in this courtroom to a fool like you! I don't care what I have to do... I will get my guilty verdict! Judge: That's enough! If you would like to continue, do so in the lobby. Court will reconvene tomorrow at 10 AM. That is all. Court is adjourned. June 21, 1:32 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Maya: Woooow! That was you Pearly!? You summoned my sis!? Pearl: Yes. I felt I had no choice... Maya: Great going, Pearly! I knew you were special! Hey, Nick, did you know? Phoenix: (...Umm, yeah. It's not like anyone else in there could have done that.) Maya: Hmm, Nick... I know you're trying really hard and all, but... I really don't remember ever leaving that room. Pearl: And I don't think that a third person... could have gone into that room. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Well, at least we have until tomorrow to figure things out. Like, what happened in that room, for instance. Maya: Yeah. I'm counting on you! Pearl: Ah... I envy the two of you... Maya: Oh, by the way, Nick. Do you think you could take Pearly back home for me? Phoenix: Sure. Alright, Pearls. You ready to go buy some tickets? Pearl: Huh? A tik-ket? Phoenix: (Poor thing... So sheltered.) To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow you. Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maya Fey... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned! Reunion, and Turnabout Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 June 21, 3:24 PMKurain Village Pearl: Thank you very much for bringing me home, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: You're welcome. I had to come and look into a few things here today anyway. Pearl: Um... I thought about this a little. Phoenix: ? Pearl: If Mystic Maya didn't kill that nice man... Phoenix: She definitely didn't! Pearl: Yes, of course. But if she didn't... Then someone else did, right? Um, that \"murderer\" person! Phoenix: Yes, Pearls. Pearl: Oh... I see... Phoenix: (I wonder what's wrong... She seems sad...) Examine Phone booth Phoenix: It's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. I called the police from this phone. Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So, what did you think of seeing your first trial? Pearl: I was really surprised! I had never seen so many people before! Phoenix: O-Oh... Pearl: And Mystic Maya looked so small... and helpless. Phoenix: (Well, Maya's already naturally short, so...) Pearl: And then, that snobby woman with the ruffly clothes... Phoenix: (Ruffly... Oh, she means Franziska...) Pearl: She had such a bad attitude! She acted like she had already decided that Mystic Maya did it... I am going to tell her what I think of her tomorrow! Phoenix: (I wouldn't miss tomorrow's trial for the world...) Prosecutors (appears after \"Today's trial\") Pearl: Why was that woman bullying Mystic Maya? Phoenix: Well, she's the opposite of a lawyer -- a prosecutor, so her job is to prove people guilty. They don't care if someone's innocent. All they care about is if they win. Pearl: Th-That's terrible! B-But... She's really a good prosecutor with a heart on the inside, right? Phoenix: ... There's no one like that. All prosecutors are the same. ... Well, \"he\" might have become a good guy... Eventually... Pearl: \"He\"? Who are you talking about, Mr. Nick? Is it that person Mystic Maya was talking about? Mr. Eh-ji-werth...? Phoenix: ...That was a long time ago. He's not around anymore... Pearl: Huh? Phoenix: He clutched onto his foolish pride too fiercely... and died for it. Pearl: O-Oh... That's too bad... The murderer Phoenix: By the way... Pearl: Yes? What is it? Phoenix: Um, you wouldn't happen to know anything about who the murderer is... would you? Pearl: Wh-Why are you asking me!? Phoenix: No, I was just thinking earlier... Pearl: I didn't see anything! Phoenix: (She \"didn't see anything\", huh...? Speaking of that... During the murder... where was Pearls, and what was she doing...? And on top of that... This key... Just when did she pick this up...?) Pearl's alibi (appears after \"The murderer\") Phoenix: I just realized that I never asked you what you were doing at the time of the crime. Pearl: ...? Phoenix: Pearls, where were you and what were you doing when the murder happened? Pearl: Ah...! Phoenix: ...? Pearl: Wh-What I-I w-was doing? Ah, I-I w-wasn't d-doing a-anything! Phoenix: (She's really bad at lying...) You can whisper it to me. I won't tell anyone else. I promise. 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: Aah! Pearl: ... Um... I guess you can see through my lie, huh? Phoenix: Yeah... Clearly. Pearl: I can't lie to you, can I, Mr. Nick? Pearl's alibi (subsequent times) Phoenix: You really won't tell me what you were doing at the time of the murder...? 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Pearl: I'm sorry... Phoenix: But with the Magatama, I can unlock your Psyche-Locks, right? Pearl: Yes... Ah, what should I do...? Should I tell you what my secret is...? Phoenix: (If you would just tell me, it would be easier for the both of us...) Pearl: I'm so nervous... Phoenix: (Pearls is holding the key to this whole case! I can feel it! ...Speaking of keys, this one turned out to be quite important too... I didn't think it would literally be the \"key\" to today's trial.) Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: So... that's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure? Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: I feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama... Phoenix: (Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...) Folding Screen Pearl: So you like things about spirit channeling too? The Kurain Sacred Writings are on this folding screen. Phoenix: Oh? Is that what's written on it? Pearl: There are six lines to the Sacred Writings. Cleanse thy soul... Open the door to the spiritual realm beyond... Converse with the departed... ... Cast on thyself Protection... Maintain the spell... Release the spell... Phoenix: (So basically, this has nothing to do with the murder... Well, that's super.) Black Key Phoenix: About this key, Pearls... You found it on the day of the murder, right? Pearl: Yes. Phoenix: Now, where you found this key is very important. So, please tell me, Pearls. Where did you find this? Pearl: Um... I found it in the incinerator... Phoenix: The incinerator? (Hmm, is she talking about the one in the garden?) Pearl: The door on it was a little open, so I took a peek... Phoenix: When was that? Pearl: It was after the channeling, when everyone was in a panic. Phoenix: Hmm... Pearl: Um... Mr. Nick? Phoenix: ...? Yes? Pearl: Are you going to tell my mother? Phoenix: Huh? You mean, tell Morgan what you did? Pearl: Yes. If she finds out that I was playing in the left-over trash, I'll get a spanking. Phoenix: ...Ah, gotcha. Well, let's keep it a secret from her then, alright? (Hmm, the incinerator, huh? Sounds like a good place to search next...) Knife Pearl: I've seen this knife before. Phoenix: Really!? Where!? Pearl: M-My kitchen... Phoenix: (Oh... That's right... This knife belongs to the Feys...) Pearl: I'll skin and cut up some apples for you later, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: O-OK... Thanks. Maya's Costume Pearl: Th-That's Mystic Maya's! Phoenix: (Ack!! I shouldn't have shown her something this violent...) Pearl: I-I-Is that... Blood!? Phoenix: Umm... It's nothing. Really. Just forget your ever saw this, okay? (What was I thinking? I can't show stuff like this to a child.) Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Phoenix: (On second thought, showing her this picture might cause severe trauma...) Pearl: ...? Mia Fey profile Pearl: I knew her for a little while. Mystic Mia was your teacher, right? I'm sure she was a great Master of Lawyers. Phoenix: (\"Master of Lawyers\"... I guess...? I mean, it's not exactly a martial art...) Pearl: You should keep training, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Y-Yeah, you're probably right. Pearl Fey profile Pearl: To tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me. Phoenix: I think your hair now suits you perfectly. Pearl: R-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget* Phoenix: *fidget, fidget* Franziska von Karma profile Pearl: Ah! This person! I can't let her get away with bullying Mystic Maya like that! I'm going to cast a curse on her! Phoenix: C-Can spirit mediums really do that...? Pearl: ... Actually, no, I guess not... Grr... I have to find something I can do, then! Phoenix: (When they're mad, the women of the Fey family could give Medusa a run for her money...) June 21Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: This case has had me out of the office most of the time... I can come back tomorrow. Helping Maya should be my top priority now. Examine Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's a handful but I've grown quite attached to the little fella. He also helps me to remember all the good times with Mia. June 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: (Maya must still be in questioning... She'll probably be done in a little bit, so I'll come back later...) June 21Fey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: (It's really empty... There's supposed to be training held today, but I guess it's already over...) Examine Door Phoenix: A door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. But I guess it wasn't strong enough to withstand The Phoenix! June 21Fey ManorChanneling Chamber Phoenix: (...Hmm, looks like Morgan's here too, but she hasn't noticed me yet... What is she doing...? She looks like she's talking to a picture...) Morgan: ...Don't you see? Take a look around... Finally, my chance has come... I've waited for this day for so long! That's right... Prepare yourself, dear Misty... Phoenix: (What in the...!?) Morgan: Who's there!? ...Oh, if it isn't Mr. Wright... Phoenix: Um... Just curious, but that picture you were just looking at... Morgan: Oh, today was that event, was it not, good sir? I heard you did well. Phoenix: Huh, oh, yes... Thank you. Morgan: I am terribly sorry I could not attend the trial today. Please accept my apology. I had a previous engagement, as I had to watch over the trainees' training today. Phoenix: (I get the sense she really doesn't want to talk about the picture...) Morgan: All because the Master can't be here with us, you understand. And that is why a lowly branch family member such as myself must do this. Examine Space behind folding screen Phoenix: There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. There wasn't anyone back here at the time of the murder... Or that's what Lotta testified in court... (I knew I should've taken a look... I can always count on Lotta to make things hard...) Talk What happened Phoenix: Have you remembered anything about the murder? (Changed from [Have you remembered something about the murder?] in the original release) Morgan: No, I told you everything I know already. Phoenix: Were you in this room the whole time when Lotta and I went to call the police? (Changed from [Where [sic] you in this room the whole time when Lotta and I went to call the police?] in the original release) Morgan: Yes, of course. I was by Mystic Maya's side the entire time. I performed the Spirit Severing Technique and held her in my arms afterward. Phoenix: Hmm, you said that yesterday as well. Did anything else happen? Morgan: I would like to say more did, however that is all that occurred. Phoenix: (Ah, I was really hoping for some new info...) Morgan: I suppose nothing happened in the end, good sir. Sorry to have played on your hopes. Phoenix: (Could you possibly be more patronizing...?) (Chnaged from [Why do I feel like I was just made fun of in the worse way possible...?] in the original release) Training Phoenix: So do the students train every day? Morgan: Yes, absolutely. They were given a day off the day after the murder, of course, however... Phoenix: And I assume both Maya and Pearls went through this training...? Morgan: Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ack! Yes, yes! (Wow, she got real scary, real fast...) Morgan: How many times must I tell you before you understand, good sir? They are to be addressed as Mystic Maya and Mystic Pearl. Phoenix: S-Sorry... I meant Mystic Maya and Mystic Pearl... Wait... I'm sorry, but \"Mystic\" Pearl? Isn't that going a bit too far...? Morgan: Next question, please. Phoenix: (Oh man... She's really being a pain in the butt about this...) Morgan: Please remember to watch not only what you say, but how you say it, good sir. The Master Phoenix: So the Master is... um, Maya's mother, right? Morgan: ...Mystic Misty... She is a brilliant medium. Phoenix: And where is she now...? Morgan: We are not sure. Phoenix: Not sure? Morgan: About 16 or 17 years ago, Mystic Misty failed at channeling a certain spirit. And after that... she simply disappeared. Phoenix: ... Morgan: I don't believe she will return to this village, in any case. And in four years' time, her name will be forever erased from this village. Phoenix: ...Erased? Morgan: A person who has been away from the village for over 20 years is considered dead... Phoenix: Oh, I see. Morgan: And that is four years from now for her. When that happens, a new Master will be appointed to Kurain Village. Phoenix: And...? Morgan: Mystic Maya was supposed to become the next Master... However with this... murder, I'm afraid... Phoenix: (I must be imagining things... I thought she was laughing to herself for a second there...) Present Folding Screen Morgan: There are six parts to the Kurain Sacred Writings. To think that this valued treasure of our village... and Mystic Maya were both shot by a gun... Phoenix: Well, that's... Morgan: Even if it was something that occured during a channeling, it is an unforgivable act. Black Key Morgan: This... This is the key to this room! Phoenix: That's right. Morgan: B-But why do you have it, good sir!? Phoenix: That, I'm not telling. Morgan: R-Return it at once! Phoenix: I... I can't. It's evidence, after all. (I think she knows exactly how important this key is to this murder... But what is this feeling I'm getting from her? It feels... Hmm... I can't describe it.) Maya's Costume Morgan: That is Mystic Maya's costume, isn't it...? It's a shame. I never thought anything like that would happen to her... Phoenix: But we don't know that it was Maya that did it... Morgan: Oh, poor Mystic Maya. Phoenix: (Do you ever listen to anyone other than yourself?) Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Morgan: That is Mystic Maya before I applied the Spirit Severing Technique... This picture... It was taken without my express permission. I knew allowing a person like her from the \"Heartland\" into our country was a bad idea. Phoenix: (You do realize that the \"Heartland\" is a part of this country, right...?) Turner Grey profile Phoenix: About this person... Morgan: Oh! It is that man, is it not? A man who wishes to borrow a departed spirit's power to hide the lack of his own. What an insignificant man. And see how pitifully he died. Phoenix: Insignificant...? Morgan: That would mean you are that man's insignificant little friend, dear sir. Phoenix: (Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?) Mia Fey profile Morgan: ...Oh, my... I think I may know of this person from somewhere... Phoenix: It's Mia. You know, Maya's older sister? Morgan: ...! Aah! Yes, that is who she is... Phoenix: (...How could you forget a daughter of the Master...!?) Morgan: If memory serves, she became a lawyer. Oh, how splendid for her, don't you think? Phoenix: (That soft, kind smile... It's the kind that tells you a pair of devil horns are not too far away...) Pearl Fey profile Morgan: Come to think of it, I don't believe I have seen my child today. Would you happen to know where she is, good sir? Phoenix: N-No, I wouldn't. Morgan: Honestly! Take one day off from training, and it is neigh impossible to make it up. Good sir! I pray you are not teaching her strange, fiendish things in her time off! Phoenix: (Oh boy. Here comes her anger. ...And we were having such a civil conversation too...) Morgan Fey profile Morgan: Being born as one of the Fey family, but of weak spiritual power... It makes the people of this village look down upon you, you know? Phoenix: I-I didn't know that... Morgan: But I will be alright. ...As long as I have Pearl. I am satisfied because I have my Pearl. Anything else Phoenix: What do you think about this? Morgan: I am terribly sorry, but I am afraid my spiritual powers are not as strong as you might think... I really am terribly sorry. Phoenix: (Um, but this has nothing to do with your spiritual power...) June 21Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Looks like there's no one here... And even though the weather is gorgeous today, it's raining inside my heart...) Examine Side Room entrance Phoenix: That's the \"Side Room\". Looks like guests can use it as a place to take a break when they feel tired. Urn Phoenix: It's a really old urn. There are the ashes of a person long dead inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on. June 21Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: (The bedding is all laid out today too. Guess I'll leave them alone for now...) Examine Sliding door Phoenix: It's still charming to see a real sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard. Bed on right Phoenix: ...Excuse me... ... (Who am I talking to? There's no one here.) Yellow box Phoenix: Hmm, I keep wondering about this box. I'm sure this wasn't here before the murder took place. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom. After presenting Black Key in Kurain Village: June 21Fey ManorWinding Way Phoenix: (Hey, there's someone by the incinerator... Ooh, looks like they've noticed me. And are now running at top speed towards me...) Ini: Oh, hey! *huff, huff* Like, *huff, huff* You're that dentist guy. Phoenix: Actually, it's Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. Nice to see you again. Ini: Ooh, like, real suave. So, it's, like, my turn. It's nice to see you, too. Phoenix: So, what's up? You're all out of breath... Ini: L-Like, huh? Oh! Like you mean... Like, I'm just totally happy and like, totally excited to be here. Phoenix: Excited? Ini: Like, I mean, there are so many things to, like, see! It's, like, the real deal here! Phoenix: Oh, really? For example...? Ini: For example... Like, that urn over there. Do you, like, know about it? Phoenix: (All I see is an old, cracked piece of pottery...) Examine Incinerator Phoenix: That's right... Pearls said she found this key inside the incinerator. I guess I should take a look inside for myself... ... Th-This... This is from Maya's costume...! There's blood on it... A tiny bit, but still... Cloth Scrap added to the Court Record. Incinerator (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, this piece of cloth was burned in this incinerator. And this key was also found in there. Hmm, I get the feeling this incinerator plays a crucial part in this murder... Urn (after clearing \"Sacred Urn\" Talk option) Phoenix: So there's a spirit in this urn, huh? Hmm, all I see are a bunch of cracks. But I guess maybe the spirit could live in the space between the cracks... Hmm, looks like something's written on it... \"I AM\"? Huh? Weird... Sacred Urn added to the Court Record. Urn (subsequent times) Phoenix: So there's a spirit in this urn, huh? Hmm, all I see are a bunch of cracks. But I guess maybe the spirit could live in the space between the cracks... Hmm, looks like something's written on it... \"I AM\"? Huh? Weird... Talk Sacred urn Phoenix: Is there some sort of legend connected with that urn? Ini: Like, yeah! It's, like, this village's treasure! Phoenix: Huh. Didn't know that. Ini: And, like, it's sealed inside that urn. Phoenix: ...Um... \"It's\"...? What are you talking about? Ini: Like, you know! Ami Fey's spirit! Phoenix: Ami... Fey...? Who's that? Ini: Like, jeez, Mr. Smith. Get with the program! Everyone knows the lady that founded the Kurain Channeling Technique was Mystic Ami. Phoenix: Um, you don't have to get upset with me... Ini: So, like, as long as her spirit, like, lives in that urn, the spiritual power of the Fey family'll stick around. Like, isn't that totally romantic? Phoenix: Umm... Romantic, huh...? (If that urn is really as important as she says, it could be a vital clue...) What happened Phoenix: Ini, I want to ask you about the murder... Ini: Murder...? Phoenix: Dr. Grey's... Remember...? (As if there's another one?) Ini: Oh, that one! Like, you shoulda said so in the first place! So, like, I totally don't know anything 'cause I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room. Phoenix: Well, that's not much help... Did you notice anything at all? Ini: Like, come on. What a total bore. I, like, totally have nothing to do with this, like, murder thing... Phoenix: (Oh, yeah. You only introduced Dr. Grey to Kurain Village. No relation, sure. Even if you were only \"acquaintances\", that still means you knew him. Furthermore, your sister, who died in that accident, was a nurse at his clinic...) Ini: ... Traffic accident (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Alright then. Why don't you tell me about your sister's fatal accident. Ini: ... Like, why? You think, like, it's got something to, like, do with the murder? Phoenix: I don't know yet, but I'm trying to chase down every lead I can... (Changed from [I don't know yet, but I'm trying to chase down every lead I have...] in the original release) 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (...Psy... Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [...A... A Psyche-Lock!] in the original release) Ini: Like, what is it? Phoenix: (Looks like I'm going to need something to pry her mouth open on this one...) Traffic accident (subsequent times) Phoenix: Um, about the accident, Ini... 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Ini: Like, you're totally not gonna give up, are you? Phoenix: No, I'm not. Ini: I totally want to forget about my sister, you know? Time to move on and all that. Phoenix: (Guess I have no choice but to remove those locks...) Present Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Ini: Wow, so, like, the Kurain technique is the real deal. I'm gonna, like, have to write about it in, like, my report for school. Hey, so, like, you'll give me this picture for, like, the report, right? Phoenix: No way! Maya Fey profile Ini: She's, like, in a lot of trouble, huh? Phoenix: (She's stealing quick glances at the picture while smiling like a cheshire cat...) Ini: But, like, this will totally prove the power of channeling. Phoenix: (...\"This\"? What \"this\" is she talking about...?) Pearl Fey profile Ini: Like, that's totally Mystic Maya's cousin, right? Phoenix: Yes. Her name is Pearl. Ini: Hmm? So, like, this little kid is, like, the next Master...? Phoenix: Oh, no, no, no. Maya is the next in line to be Master. Ini: Ah, oh yeah. Like, that's right. After clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber, and presenting Black Key in Kurain Village, then examining incinerator in Fey Manor - Winding Way: June 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: Hey, Nick... I've been waiting... Phoenix: (...She looks so helpless...) Maya: So? So? How was it!? What did you find out!? Phoenix: Um... Well... I found a few things... Maya: Is it so bad that you can't even look me in the eye? (Changed from [My eyes are tearing up, Nick. Don't make me cry...] in the original release) Phoenix: I... I just need a little more time. It'll all come together by tomorrow, I promise. Maya: I'm sorry, Nick. Every time I see you, all I do is cause trouble... Talk Today's trial Phoenix: So how was it? Today's trial, I mean... Maya: You were fantastic, Nick! Every time I thought our goose was cooked, you managed to turn it all around. I bet it would make a great Hollywood movie! Phoenix: Don't be silly. We have to concentrate on the trial. We're going to win this, Maya! Maya: ...Thanks a lot. Really. Hey, Nick? The person who shot Dr. Grey wasn't me, was it? Phoenix: Of course not. You're completely innocent. Maya: If that were true, then I'd be really happy, but... there wasn't anyone else in that room with the two of us, right? Phoenix: Well, did you check behind the folding screen? Maya: Um... I took a quick glance, but there wasn't anyone there. Phoenix: Hmm... (That's exactly what Lotta said too...) Not guilty Maya: Um, Nick... Phoenix: Yeah? Maya: Why do you believe in me? Why do you think I didn't kill Dr. Grey? Phoenix: ...Because of something Mia told me. Maya: My sis? What did she tell you? Phoenix: She said that spirit mediums can't have dreams. When you're channeling, it's impossible for you to dream because your soul leaves you. Maya: Now that you mention it... Wait, then... then... I really am...? Phoenix: You are not the real murderer. I think that... maybe before you even called the spirit, you were drugged. Maya: Drugged...? Phoenix: I think this was planned from the very beginning. And you were set up to take the blame for killing Dr. Grey. Maya: That's... That's... Pearl's alibi (appears after clearing \"Pearl's alibi\" Talk option in Kurain Village) Phoenix: I want to ask you something about Pearls. Maya: Pearly? What about her? Phoenix: No matter what I try, she won't answer me. I want to know what she was doing at the time of the murder. Maya: Huh!? (Changed from [Hmm...] in the original release) W-Wait! Nick! Y-You don't think she did it, do you!? Phoenix: No, no, nothing like that... Maya: She'd never do anything like that! You hear me!? Never! She's a great kid, and really cute... And really great... And cute. Phoenix: I didn't really think she was the murderer. But... she's definitely hiding something. Maya: Hmm... Phoenix: You were with her on that day, right? Maya: Yeah. The two of us. We were playing with her ball. Phoenix: A ball, huh? (Sounds like a dead-end to me...) Ball (appears after \"Pearl's alibi\") Phoenix: So, about this ball... Maya: It's nothing really special... Just a plain old ball. I think she was still playing with it when I started the channeling job that day. Pearly really loves to play with that ball. Phoenix: She \"loves to play with that ball\", huh...? Maya: When she wants to get it, she always climbs right into the clothing box. Phoenix: The clothing box? Maya: Yeah. Pearly's always hiding in there. You know the Side Room? There's a clothing box in there. It's really big, so once you see it, I'm sure you'll know what I'm talking about. Phoenix: (The clothing box in the Side Room, huh?) Present Attorney's Badge Maya: It's the same as the last time I saw it. You just like to show it off, don't you, Nick? Are you that thrilled to be a lawyer? Phoenix: Th-That's not what I meant by it, but... I mean, I don't really think about it. I just sort of shove it in people's faces... Force of habit, I guess. Folding screen Maya: That hole... It looks an awful lot like a bullet hole... Phoenix: That's probably what it is. Maya: That's TERRIBLE! How could this happen to such an important screen!? Phoenix: ... Um, instead of dwelling on the hole, let's focus on the fact that you weren't shot... Maya: ... Hey, you're right! So I was the one who was about to get shot, huh? Th-That's TERRIBLE! Who'd want to shoot little ol' me!? Phoenix: (I guess she didn't realize she was the one being shot at until now...) Black Key Maya: Ah! That's... The Channeling Chamber's... Phoenix: This is the only one in the world, right? Maya: Yeah. During the trial, I was kinda wondering why you had it... Phoenix: I got it from Pearls. Maya: That's weird... I swear I locked the door... and then put the key into one of my pouchy sleeves... Phoenix: Your sleeve? But how and when would your sleeve leave the room? It didn't grow a pair of legs... Maya: I wonder where Pearly found that key... Knife Maya: That's a knife from my family's kitchen. I'll never be able to use it again... Phoenix: It's alright. I'll buy you a new one, OK? Maya: Argh! That's not the point! ...I don't ever want to see another knife... ever again... Maya's Costume Maya: That... That's... That's mine, isn't it? Phoenix: (Dammit! I upset her again...) Maya: It really was me, wasn't it? Wasn't it, Nick? Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Maya: This... This is me, right? I guess I really did shoot Dr. Grey... Phoenix: But that's not you! Maya: Is too! Phoenix: Is not! Maya: Is too, is too! Phoenix: (I should've kept this picture to myself...) Sacred Urn Maya: That's Kurain's Sacred Urn. Mystic Ami's soul is sealed inside of it. Phoenix: Yeah, I know all about it. About how she's the founder of the Kurain Technique. Maya: Ooh, look at Mr. Smarty here! Thinks he knows all! You sound like an occult fanatic. Phoenix: (...Trust me, this isn't going on my resume any time soon...) Maya: You know, I haven't looked at this in a long time. I wonder when it became so cracked? Cloth Scrap Maya: ...What is it? Phoenix: I'm not too sure myself, but I found it just now inside the furnace. Maya: Huh? Is it trash burning day already? Phoenix: That's not something I would know about... (I guess she didn't notice the bloodstain. Probably better that way...) Mia Fey profile Maya: What am I supposed to do, sis!? ... Pearl Fey profile Maya: Pearly... She definitely has more than me... Phoenix: Huh? What are you talking about? Maya: Who I think the next Master should be... I mean, she's got more spiritual power than me, and she really works hard at her training... Phoenix: (Way to go Phoenix... Way to bring the mood down even further... *sigh*) Franziska von Karma profile Maya: So she's Prosecutor von Karma's daughter, huh? Phoenix: Looks like it. Maya: Well, then... she'd know about that person, right? Phoenix: (\"That person\"...? Is she talking about \"him\"?) It's alright. We don't need to talk about that right now... Maya: ... Ami Fey profile Maya: ...Mystic Ami. She's a Legendary Spirit Medium. I like the way that word sounds... \"Legendary\"... Ever since I was young, I've dreamed of being a \"Legend\". Phoenix: (Well, this murder will make you into a \"legend\", alright... Hmm... I probably shouldn't say that last thought out loud...) Any other evidence Maya: Um, I can't think of anything special about it... After clearing \"Ball\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: June 21Kurain Village Phoenix: Ah! Lotta: AAAAAAAAH! Phoenix: H-Hey! Wait! Please! Lotta! ... (She ran off into the manor...) June 21Fey ManorMeditation Room Phoenix: Lotta... Lotta: Aaack! Phoenix: H-Hey! I'm tellin' ya, quit followin' me, ya hear!? I'm a worthless piece of trash! Ya lay eyes on me, and they'll turn ta dust! Phoenix: (...*sigh*...) Channeling Chamber Phoenix: Hey! Morgan! Morgan: Yes, what is it? ...And must you be so noisy!? We have a rule here: \"The hallway is not for running\" Now then, in a calm manner ask your question. Phoenix: Okay... Anyway, did you see Lotta come by here? Morgan: Ah, that girl from the \"Heartland\"... I'm sorry, but she did not pass by here at any time. Phoenix: (Grr... Lotta! You sure know how to waste a man's time...) June 21Fey ManorSide Room Phoenix: I'm pretty sure I saw Lotta run in this direction... but it doesn't look like she's here... Examine Ball Phoenix: It's Pearl's ball. Maya said that it's always kept in the clothing box... So then, what is it doing on the floor...? Pearl's Ball taken. Clothing box Phoenix: It's the clothing box where Pearl's ball is usually kept. I wonder what's inside... Aaaaah! Phoenix: Whaaaa!? Wh-Wh-What were you doing in there!? What were you thinking!? Lotta: I'm a bad person! Just another piece of human trash. I needed a hole to crawl into... Phoenix: ... (So you crawled into this clothing box because there wasn't a hole to crawl into? Oh man... ...Huh?) There's a small hole in this clothing box... And it's about... 8 inches off the ground! That's the same height as the hole in the folding screen! Then, could this...? Clothing Box added to the Court Record. Clothing box (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's the clothing box where Pearls keeps her ball. I thought I felt my soul shake when Lotta jumped out at me. So it's big enough to fit a grown adult... Well, if she can be called an adult... June 21Fey ManorMeditation Room Pearl: Oh, Mr. Nick! That person ran by here just now. Phoenix: What person? Pearl: Um, you know... The person with the fluffy cotton candy hair... Phoenix: (Ah, she means Lotta.) Pearl: She said, \"Don't look at me with 'em eyes!\" but... I'm not that scary, am I...? Phoenix: ...I don't think that's quite what she meant. Pearl: Oh, that's right. She also wanted me to tell you, \"Goin' on a trip to find myself, so don't ya bother findin' me!\" Phoenix: O-Oh... Well, thanks. Pearl: You're welcome. Talk Pearl's alibi (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Pearl: Around when Mystic Maya started the channeling on that day, I was playing in the Winding Way... with my ball. Phoenix: And that's when you... broke the urn? Pearl: Y-Yes... I broke it... I... I accidentally let Mystic Ami's spirit fly away! Phoenix: Don't worry. Morgan will never know, OK? Pearl: I'm a bad child... Breaking a village treasure is unforgivable. I thought... that maybe they would make me leave the village. But the broken pieces were pretty big, so... Phoenix: You thought you could put them back together, and no one would notice? Pearl: ...Yes. Sacred Urn (appears after \"Pearl's alibi\") Pearl: I found some glue and brought it to the hallway... and fixed the urn there. Phoenix: The hallway? You mean \"Winding Way\"? Pearl: Yes. The channeling had already started, so I didn't think anyone would walk by. Phoenix: Hmm, I see... So, about how long did it take you? It must have been a nasty repair job. Pearl: Yes. I might be strong at spiritual things, but when it comes to arts and crafts, I am not nearly as skilled. When I had finished fixing the urn and looked up, I saw you coming into the manor... Phoenix: (So that's around when Lotta and I were coming back inside after reporting the murder.) Pearl: When I saw that, I packed everything up in a hurry. Um... Mr. Nick? Phoenix: What is it, Pearls? Pearl: I'm... I'm going to get banished, aren't I? Phoenix: I really don't think that's going to happen. I mean, I bet Mystic Ami's happy to be free from that cramped urn. Pearl: Y-Yeah, I hope so... Phoenix: (No harm done, and a happy resolution... Phew!) Sacred Urn updated in the Court Record. Sacred Urn (appears after \"Pearl's alibi\") Pearl: I found some glue and brought it to the hallway... and fixed the urn there. Phoenix: The hallway? You mean \"Winding Way\"? Pearl: Yes.

Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Pearl's Alibi -- Phoenix: Pearl. You have to tell me what you were doing when the murder happened, OK? Pearl: Um... But what if I can't just tell you what happened...? Phoenix: Then I'll guess what happened. How does that sound? Pearl: What!? Y-You can do that? (Changed from [Eh!? Y-You can do that?] in the original release) Phoenix: You'll tell me if I guess something right, won't you? Pearl: ...Y-Yes... Phoenix: Now, when the murder was taking place, you were here, right? Present Winding Way Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were here, weren't you Pearls -- in the Winding Way?\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: I'm pretty smart, Pearls. I know you were right here. Pearl: No, I wasn't... Phoenix: Huh? I'm wrong? Pearl: Ooh, I feel a little better. Phoenix: (Ooh, I feel a little warmer... from embarrassment. ...I'd better try again...) Leads back to: \"Now, when the murder was taking place, you were here, right?\" Phoenix: You were here, weren't you Pearls -- in the Winding Way? Pearl: W-Wow! ...Y-You got it. Phoenix: So? Do you think you can tell me now? Pearl: ...I'm sorry... Not yet... Phoenix: Man, oh man... Alright, what next...? OK, I think I know what you were doing there. Pearl: D-Do you really know that much? Phoenix: Well, I am a lawyer, you know. Now, what was it Pearls was doing in the Winding Way? Present Pearl's Ball Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were... playing with this ball, right?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... Phoenix: So? Pearl: I feel just a little better. Phoenix: Huh? Pearl: You are a lawyer, but you're also still a person, after all... Phoenix: Sorry, I'll get it right this time... Leads back to: \"OK, I think I know what you were doing there.\" Phoenix: You were... playing with this ball, right? Pearl: Ah! That's right! How... How did you know...? 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Maya told me that you love to play with your ball. Pearl: Um... Yeah. I was playing with my ball. Phoenix: Un, huh. And then? Pearl: ... Phoenix: Something happened, huh? ...Something really bad... Pearl: *gulp!* Wh-What do you mean, \"something\"!? N-N-Nothing happened...! Phoenix: This is it. While you were playing with your ball, this happened! Present Sacred Urn Phoenix: Leads to: \"This urn... It's a village treasure, right?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ... Phoenix: Were you so surprised that you were shocked into silence? Pearl: ...Yes, at how wrong you are, even though you were so sure of yourself... Phoenix: ...Huh? (Way to embarrass yourself in front of an 8 year old, Wright...) Ah, sorry, sorry. Just see if you were paying attention... Ah heh heh. Pearl: It's okay Mr. Nick. You can always try again. Leads back to: \"This is it.\" Phoenix: This urn... It's a village treasure, right? Pearl: Ah... Um... Phoenix: And the spirit of the founder of the Kurain technique is sealed in here, isn't it? Pearl: ...Y-Yes... Phoenix: What's this? It's cracked all over, isn't it? There's even a few gaps here and there... Pearl: Um... Please don't tease me... Phoenix: Pearl, you broke the Sacred Urn, didn't you? Pearl: ...! Phoenix: The ball smacked into it and knocked it over, right? And if Morgan found out, she'd get really mad, huh? Pearl: ... Phoenix: (She doesn't seem to be fighting back... I think I hit the bull's-eye this time. But it's strange that the lock hasn't broken yet...) Pearl: I-It's... It's a really old urn, isn't it? Phoenix: I-I guess? (Changed from [Eh?] in the original release) Pearl: I-I-It's so old... So it's not that weird... to have a few cracks... Phoenix: (Her voice is shaking...) Pearl: H-How can you tell that urn has been broken!? Present Ami Fey profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Who started the Kurain Channeling Technique?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: ...I'm sorry. I don't want to be mean, but... Phoenix: (*sigh* I figured...) Pearl: Um, do you want to try again? Phoenix: Yeah. (I'm sure I can get it if I think about it some more! The thing I'm missing... must have something to do with what's written on the urn...) Leads back to: \"H-How can you tell that urn has been broken!?\" Phoenix: Who started the Kurain Channeling Technique? Pearl: Huh? (Changed from [Eh?] in the original release) Oh, um, it was Mystic Ami... (Changed from [Um, it was Mystic Ami...] in the original release) Phoenix: That's right. And how do you spell her name? Do you know? Pearl: How do I spell her name? Um... I don't know... Phoenix: It's spelled \"A-M-I\". Pearl: *gasp!* Phoenix: I thought it was a little odd when I saw \"I AM\" written on this urn. Pearl: ... Phoenix: And that's how I knew that someone must have broken this urn. And made a mistake in spelling when they put it back together again... 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful After examining the \"Clothing box\"  in Fey Manor - Side Room and adding it to the Court Record: June 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: M-Mia! Mia: Phoenix, it's good to see you. I was really worried so I thought I'd see how you were doing. Phoenix: ...You might get caught on film again... Mia: There are certain risks you have to take in life, or in my case, death. Anyway, how are you doing? Have you found anything useful? Phoenix: Um, only a little. I think I'm slowly beginning to understand everything, piece by piece. Mia: Everything will resolve itself by tomorrow, somehow. Talk Tomorrow's trial Mia: There's still a whole slew of questions for you to answer before the trial tomorrow. Phoenix: You mean like how did the real murderer get into the room and kill Dr. Grey...? Mia: Yes. Also, when did the murderer enter the Channeling Chamber...? You guys were all standing around in front of the room after the channeling started. Phoenix: Which means that the murderer must have gone into that room before the channeling... Mia: That's what I think, in any case. Phoenix: But Maya's already said there wasn't anyone else in there. Mia: ...That's true... But if we can't figure out the murderer's movements, we're stuck like a beached whale. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Kurain Channeling Technique Mia: I thought I'd never see this day. Are you actually asking me about spirit channeling? Phoenix: This case is all about spirit channeling. And I feel like I don't understand a thing about it... Mia: Well, that's only natural... After all, spirit channeling isn't exactly an everyday thing, is it? Phoenix: Yeah, I guess you're right. Mia: The power to change your physical appearance into the person you're calling was something our ancestor, Mystic Ami Fey acquired. Phoenix: I've heard that name before... Mia: The Fey family was originally a family known for its service to the gods. When Mystic Ami was born, she was given a certain fate through her name. Because, you see, she was named after one of the Buddhas of Buddhism, \"Amitábha\". To this day, her soul is still sealed in the Kurain Sacred Urn. It usually sits in the Winding Way, and has her name written on it. Phoenix: Um, yeah... Mia: Aww, come on, Phoenix. It's just a fairy-tale. Phoenix: (Are you saying that me being able to see you is just a fairy-tale too...?) Present Anything Mia: Come on, Phoenix. We don't have time to be looking at things like this. We need to find out everything we can for the trial tomorrow. After clearing all Talk options: Mia: Well, it's about time I left. Phoenix: M-Mia! Mia: We'll be in big trouble if the guard sees me here... Phoenix... Phoenix: Yes, Chief! Mia: There is still a lot of dirt left in this case. Once you think you've gathered all the evidence, then come back. Phoenix: ...Yes, Chief. After clearing \"Sacred Urn\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Meditation Room: June 21Kurain Village Phoenix: (Phew. I think I've found everything I can. But I can't see how it all adds up... Hmm... (Changed from [But I can't see how they all add up... Hmm...] in the original release)) ...H... He... Phoenix: (And is Ini Miney being here just a coincidence...?) ...Hey, Mister... Phoenix: (How is it that the spirit Dr. Grey wanted to call just happened to be that nurse, and that nurse turns out to be Ini's sister... It's too... convenient...) ...Hey! Phoenix! I'm talkin' to you! Phoenix: (I wish I knew a little more about Ini, but where am I going to find info like that?) Oh, I get it. Ya can't be bothered to look over at trash like me. Is that it, Mr. High-and-Mighty!? Phoenix: Aah! L-Lotta! Lotta: Oh, so ya finally noticed! Phoenix: (I thought I heard a mosquito buzzing in my ear, although I couldn't understand a word...) Lotta: Well, I gotta hand it to ya. Ya sure know how to chase down garbage! I mean, I'm grateful to ya for chasin' this large lump of one around like this. Phoenix: Um... Thanks...? Lotta: But ya know, you're just wastin' yer time. I'll be fine on my own. Phoenix: Wh-What are you going on about? And as for \"following\" or \"chasing\" or whatever it is, isn't that what YOU'RE doing!? Lotta: Um, well, ya see... Well, yer not exactly a real gentleman with a lady's heart, are ya? Phoenix: (You're not exactly the world's number one charmer either, sister.) Talk Today's trial Lotta: Look, I'm really dang sorry about today! When I get all fired up about somethin', it's impossible to stop me. Phoenix: You hurt Maya really badly, Lotta. Lotta: Um... I don't suppose you could forgive a gal like me...? Forgive her Phoenix: Well, I guess. You did help Maya out too, after all. Lotta: For real? Phoenix: Yeah, for real. Lotta: Ah, thank goodness... I'm still... Phoenix: \"I'm still...\" what...? Lotta: N-No, no, nothing, nothing at all. Just talkin' to myself, ya know, gibberish... ...Now then! Lotta Hart, at your service! Phoenix: ? Lotta: I'll share with ya all the dirt I've dug up! Phoenix: Th-Thanks. Lotta: Hey, don't be all surprised! Tell ya what, I'll even give ya all this info for free! Phoenix: (Lotta not taking money? Now I KNOW this one's an alien clone...) Leads back to Talk options Don't forgive her Phoenix: I'm not done... Lotta: Um... Phoenix: And to think we trusted you, Lotta, and what do you do!? You stab us in the back! You stressed us all out and even gave Maya a few strands of white hair! Lotta: Urngh... Phoenix: Now I'm going to have to pray she makes it, or she may come back as a ghost... Lotta: Ack! That's enough! Ya can stop right there! Look, I'll tell ya everything I know! Everything! I'll spill it all! Phoenix: Everything? Lotta: Yeah, ya got it! Everything! But... Well, actually... Tell ya what, I'll even do it for free! Phoenix: (You were expecting me to pay you after what you did to us!?) Leads back to Talk options The murderer Phoenix: If Maya is not the real murderer, then... who do you think is, Lotta? Lotta: Well heck, ain't it obvious? It's that occult freak! Phoenix: You mean Ini Miney? Lotta: Well, there ain't anyone else it could be, right? That granny, you and me, we were all together that whole time... Phoenix: (So, Lotta suspects Ini... Which means she might have already found some info about our mysterious Ini...) Ini Miney (appears after \"Today's trial\" and presenting Ini Miney profile) Phoenix: Speaking of Ini, do you have any other information about her? Lotta: Sure. Phoenix: Well, what is it!? Lotta: Ha ha ha... It'll cost ya... And it'll cost a lot! Phoenix: (Oh, silly me. Here I thought \"free\" meant \"no money necessary\".) Lotta: That girl was hospitalized about half a year ago. Phoenix: Hospitalized...? But why? Lotta: Well, heck, you can go find out on yer own. Phoenix: Huh? Lotta: Here, I'll give ya the clinic's address. Maybe ya can find out something. Phoenix: \"Maybe\"...? What's that supposed to mean!? Lotta: Well... See, actually, it was gonna be annoying, I reckoned, so I didn't actually go there. Phoenix: Aargh... Lotta: Well, that's the way the gumbo spoils, right? Phoenix: Spoiled gumbo sounds... Eww... I mean, look, don't blame this on... Oh, never mind! (Looks like I don't have much of a choice. Better go check out this \"Hotti Clinic\"...) Present Newspaper Clipping 1 or Newspaper Clipping 2 Phoenix: About this clipping... Lotta: Now, you listen here, boy, and listen good. You can't go lookin' at such an old piece of paper, ya hear!? People's got eyes on the front side. You know why? So they can see in front of themselves! Not behind! So how about it? You feelin' my energy? Phoenix: (Nope, not an electron.) Pistol Lotta: Ya think I could have the guts to carry one of these around? A celebrity photographer with a gun? Ya think it'd work? \"Bang, bang!!\" ...Nah... Thanks, but nah. I can't see myself like that. Knife or Maya's Costume Lotta: Aaaaah! Th-There's... There's blood on it!! Get that away from me! Where do you get off showin' somethin' like this to me!? Phoenix: (Oops, guess that was the wrong thing to show her...) Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Lotta: I'm a real natural, aren't I? I caught the murder just right, and even managed to make it mysterious. Phoenix: Mysterious!? All you managed to do was forget to focus your lens! Lotta: Shaddup! That's my technique! My technique, now, ya hear!? Turner Grey profile Lotta: Hey, it's that Dr. Grey guy. It's a pity what happened to him. Pretty scary what ghouls and ghosts can do to a man, huh? Gawd rest his poor soul. Phoenix: (Hmm... Since when was Lotta so religious...?) Maya Fey profile Lotta: Now, this kid -- I think she needs to be taught some manners. This here's her second time in the stew, right? My Pa woulda slapped me straight! Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Lotta: Ya know what they say, if there's a second time, there's bound to be a third, and a fo- OW! Nngh... Ya didn't have to slap me. I get it, I get it. Sorry... Pearl Fey profile Lotta: Hmm... I overlooked this little kid. Phoenix: Wh-What do you mean? Lotta: I mean, I didn't think it, but ya know how it's always 'em silent types? Phoenix: H-Huh!? Wait, wait, wait... Lotta: The little tyke's nothin' but a ball of happy goodness, right? So I reckon, she's the type to have done it! Well, now, that's just how the world turns. Phoenix: I don't think this has anything to do with how the world turns... Morgan Fey profile Lotta: That old lady sure can be forceful. She scared me that day. ...Well, only a little, now, ya hear? Ini Miney profile Lotta: Heh, that's Ini Miney, right? Phoenix: Yeah. I was wondering if you know anything about this girl... Lotta: Ya know! Actually, I did a little checkin' up on her the other day. Her sister, she's the one that Dr. Grey wanted to call back from the spirit world. Phoenix: Yeah, I had heard as much... I had also heard that Ini was the one to introduce Dr. Grey to Kurain Village. Lotta: Ya don't say? That's one sneaky gal, if you ask me... Hey, ya want me to tell ya more about her? Lotta Hart profile Lotta: Ya know, I'm beginnin' to get sick of this hairstyle. Next time I go to the salon, I'm gonna get my hair straightened, I reckon. What do ya think, Phoenix? Phoenix: I think if you got rid of your afro, I wouldn't recognize who you were. Lotta: Yeah, that's kinda the problem, ain't it? Phoenix: (Please, can we get on with the important stuff...? Say, like the murderer...) Franziska von Karma profile Lotta: Hey, this is that prosecutor gal. The one that likes breakin' all the rules. Switches are for horses and lights, not people! How's that? I made a pretty clever pun, didn't I? Phoenix: ...Sorry, didn't hear you. Lotta: Ah, well, I'll forgive the wax in yer ears this once and tell it to ya one more time.

Hmm... Phoenix: Ah, yes... Are you a doctor here...? ???: Hmm, yes... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. Phoenix: (Ack! I didn't think I'd be speaking with the Director himself...) Hotti: Hmm, yes...? So what can I help you with? Uh, huh... Phoenix: I'd like to ask you a few questions about Ms. Ini Miney. Hotti: Hmm? Ms. Miney? Ms. Ini Miney? ...Hmm... Yes... Hmm... OH! Her! Ah, it's too bad. I'll tell you something. That girl left here a long time ago. Nurse: Here you are! Sir! Phoenix: ? Nurse: You know you shouldn't be up and about! Come on, it's back to your room with you! Hotti: Ah, Sweet'ums! Calm down, calm down. Don't be so harsh to an old man like me. Nurse: Don't you dare start that \"Sweet'ums\" thing with me! If you don't behave, you'll get yourself tossed out of this hospital! Phoenix: (Wow. I didn't think nurses could be this direct or forceful towards their boss.) Nurse: Come now. Be a good boy and give me the Director's white lab coat! Hotti: OK, OK. I got it. I. Got. It. Hmm, yes... Phoenix: ... Hotti: ... Phoenix: Um... Hotti: Hmm, yes? Uh, huh? Phoenix: Don't \"Hmm, yes\" me. Who in the world are you? Hotti: I'm Director Hotti. Hoh, hoh. Phoenix: ... Phoenix: (The nurse went off somewhere... Oh the inhumanity. Only person I can talk to... ...is this guy... ...Uuuugh...) Examine Waiting room on left Phoenix: This must be the waiting area. It's got the feeling of one and there are sofas lined up... but I don't see all that many patients. Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, it's the quality, not quantity that counts. Uh huh... Phoenix: (What in the world did that have to do with anything...?) Door at end of hallway Phoenix: (I wonder where that door way down there leads to...?) Hotti: Oh, that's the X-ray room. Hmm, yes... Phoenix: H-H-How did you know what I was thinking!? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, it's... Because that's the X-ray room... Uh huh, yes... Phoenix: (There is something very peculiar about this guy... Because I know it's not me...) Patient with crutches Phoenix: This patient is undergoing rehabilitation. Hotti: And look at that strained face twisting in all those ways... and that oily sweat... hmm... His whole body is swaying back and forth, wobble-wobble, like he's about to fall. Hmm, yes.

Reception area Phoenix: This is the clinic's reception desk, but it doesn't look like there's anyone at the counter. On the wall is this month's \"Word to the Wise: Do something in vain, and your only reward is tiredness.\" Hmm, not exactly the best thing to be telling your patients, is it? Talk Hotti Clinic Phoenix: So, what exactly do you treat at this clinic...? Hotti: Hmm, yes... We treat all sorts of... doctory, clinical stuff, uh, huh, yes... Phoenix: D-Doctory, clinical stuff? Hotti: Well, I don't actually know or particularly care about the details. Hoh, hoh. Phoenix: ... Hotti: Hmm, hmm... Yes... What is that look for? A-Ah, yes. There's a really big general hospital around the corner. Hmm, yes... When they can't accommodate everyone, they move some of their patients here. Uh, huh. Phoenix: You do surgeries here, right? Hotti: Hmm, yes... We do some plastic surgery here, it seems... Hmm... Phoenix: It... seems? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Uh, huh... It seems that way. Ini Miney Phoenix: What do you know about Ms. Ini Miney? Hotti: Now you're talking! Hmm, yes. That girl, she was transferred from the general hospital. Phoenix: From the general hospital...? To here? What kind of surgery did she need? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, she needed surgery. It was really bad. Really bad. Phoenix: So what kind was it...? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well... No, no... You see, that is something... No, I can't tell you. Phoenix: (So you say with a happy smile on your face... \"Mr. Director\"...) Hotti: See, there's this thing about how doctors aren't allowed to talk about patient stuff. It's in all those TV shows too, right? You've seen them, right? Hmm, yes? Phoenix: (I'm never going to get him to unzip those broken zipper teeth of his at this rate... There's got to be something I can show to this old coot...) Ini Miney (after presenting Attorney's Badge) Phoenix: Please tell me what you know about Ini Miney. Hotti: Hmm, yes... I'll get to that, trust me, I will. That girl... That's right. She was transferred here from the general hospital. This was... hmm, yes... a year ago. She was one of those... \"emergency\" cases. Phoenix: What was she ill with? Hotti: Ill? Nah, nah, nah. She was injured, not ill. With my trained eye, I could see. Yep, I could see it was a huge wound at that. Phoenix: A huge injury? Hotti: Her whole body was wrapped around and 'round in bandages and her arm was in a cast. Phoenix: That sounds... pretty severe, alright... Hotti: Hmm, yes... It was an accident; an accident. They're scary, yes? Cars, hmm, yes... Phoenix: Car...? ...You mean it was a traffic accident? Hotti: Yep! That's what gave her the terrible injuries. I swore it was in the papers, hmm... Yes, I looked it all up, I did. It was terrible... Hmm, yes... Phoenix: (...Dare I even ask what is wrong with this old guy...?) The operation (appears after \"Ini Miney\") Phoenix: Just now... You mentioned something about a big operation? Hotti: Hmm? Are you talking about Miss Ini's operation? Phoenix: Y-Yes... Miss Ini's. Hotti: That... Ah, that was one heck of an accident. Hmm, yes... Her whole face was burned like bad toast. It was bad. Very bad. Phoenix: Was it really that bad...? Hotti: Hmm, it was a good thing that Miss Ini had a picture of herself. I heard that picture was how they put her face back together... Hmm... Phoenix: Picture...? Hotti: That girl, see, she had, uh... She had just gotten her license. So she just happened to have a license photo on her, hmm, yes... Phoenix: Oh. Hotti: So, see, I got her picture. As a way to remember her, yes... Well, more like... Swiped... Phoenix: (Um, breech [sic] of ethics...? ...Oh, wait...) Hotti: What? What? A pretty girl like her -- I bet she has lots of pictures of herself... Phoenix: Um... Sure... Hotti: It's a treasure. My treasure... Preciiiious... Phoenix: What happened to the actual license itself? Hotti: Who knows. I didn't bother to ask. It probably got burned up along with the car. Hmm, yes. License Photo added to the Court Record. The operation (subsequent times) Phoenix: Just now... You mentioned something about a big operation? Hotti: Hmm? Are you talking about Miss Ini's operation? Phoenix: Y-Yes... Miss Ini's. Hotti: That... Ah, that was one heck of an accident. Hmm, yes... Her whole face was burned like bad toast. It was bad. Very bad. Phoenix: Was it really that bad...? Hotti: Hmm, it was a good thing that Miss Ini had a picture of herself. I heard that picture was how they put her face back together... Hmm... Phoenix: Picture...?

The accident (appears after \"Ini Miney\") Phoenix: Um... So you \"looked up\" information on Ini's accident, correct? Hotti: Yep, yep. Sure did... Hmm, yes... I read every paper that covered it at the time. Phoenix: What kind of accident was it, do you remember? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Hold on. I'll go get it for you. The article, I mean. Phoenix: H-Huh? Y-You have it? Hotti: Well, well, well, don't get me wrong. I thought something like this might come up, so. Phoenix: (Obsessive to the max... But I bet I could learn about how to stay on a lead from this guy.) Ah, here we go, here we go... Hmm, yes... Hotti: According to this, Miss Ini was in the passenger's seat. Phoenix: The passenger's seat, huh? Hotti: And dozing... Or so it says. A strong jolt woke her up, and the next minute, a sea of fire was all around her. Miss Ini fought with the door, finally got it to open, and somehow managed to get away. ...Anywhoo, you can read all the details in the article. Hmm, yes...

What is with your angry face? Violence isn't the answer, hmm, yes... Phoenix: The trial is tomorrow. And I would really like some information from you. Hotti: Hmm... Is that right...? ...Well, you know, I think I can let you in on a little secret... Phoenix: What's that? Hotti: Hmm, yes... Actually, ... I'm not the real Director. Phoenix: Are you kidding!? Anyone with half a fly's brain knew that! Hotti: Eh!? Wh-What do you mean!? Phoenix: (Do I have to explain this to him...?) Hotti: Well, hmm... Hold on. I'll give you something. Real information, OK?

How about you keep that kind of information to yourself...? Hotti: Hoh, hoh, hoh. Anyway, you wanted to know about Little Miss Ini Miney, right? (Changed from [Hoh, hoh, hoh. Anyway, you wanted to know about Miss Ini Miney, right?] in the original release) Phoenix: (\"Little Miss\" Ini Miney?)

Lotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2 Hotti: Now this is what I'm talking about! Hmm, yes... nice. This is nice and exciting. Phoenix: What do you think? Does anything grab your attention? Hotti: There's no mistaking this is nice... Hmm, yes... I like... Yes... I like this picture... Hmm, yes... Mind if I borrow this for a while...? For... \"private research\" purposes... Phoenix: Umm, that's okay... (I don't think I should support his \"research\"...) License Photo or Ini Miney profile Hotti: Mmm... Miss Ini is really cute in this picture. You'd agree, right? Phoenix: Y-Yeah, sure. Hotti: I wish I could see her again. Maybe the next time she has a big accident. Hmm, yes... Phoenix: ...I'll tell her for you... Hotti: Hmm, yes... Please... Hmm... I'll be waiting for her... Hmm... Yes... Waiting... Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So about this girl... Hotti: Hmm... She is... Um... Not the best... Hmm, yes...

Pearl Fey profile Phoenix: So, about this girl... Hotti: Isn't she the patient down in room 206...? Hmm, yes... I'm sure that cute nurse is taking very good care of her. That nurse said the girl has chicken pox... or was it measles... Maybe the flu...? Phoenix: (Um, Pearls is fine and well, although I feel sorry for the nurse now.) Mimi Miney profile Phoenix: About this person... Hotti: Hmm... Hmm... I feel like... I feel like... Somewhere... I've seen her somewhere before, I think... Hmm... Hmm... Well, when she comes tomorrow for her consultation, I'm sure we can get re-acquainted... Phoenix: (...I don't believe this...) Franziska von Karma profile Phoenix: This person... Hotti: Ooh, she's nice. That look in her eye... She looks like a queen. She's glaring at me. Hmm... Ah, her stare is making me choke up in tears. Phoenix: ...I... I was whipped by her...

Director Hotti (purported) profile Hotti: Oh, it's me. Hmm, yes... My tuft of hair... It's so nice. Shows off my smartness... You should try it too. My new hairstyle that I invented... Phoenix: ...Ah, that's OK. I'll pass on this one... Any other evidence Phoenix: Um, so what do you know about this...? Hotti: I see this and, um, my mind's blank. Hmm, yes. It's boring, that's why. Boring. Hmm, yes... How do I put it? If you had more... Hmm... More attractive items... Yes... Phoenix: (...Attractive...? Huh?) Any other profile Phoenix: So, I'd like to ask you about this person... Hotti: Hmm... Something tells me... Hmm, yes... Umm... No, nothing. There is no need to bring this person in for an exam. Wouldn't do it anyway. Hmm... Phoenix: (Even as a pretend doctor, he gets an F from me...) After clearing \"The operation\" and \"The accident\" Talk options: Hotti: It's been half a year since Miss Ini had her surgery and got better. She was discharged sometime in December last year. Phoenix: (It's already been half a year, huh...?) Hotti: Hmm, yes... So, how was I? I was a real help, wasn't I? Hmm, yes... Phoenix: Y-Yes... Thank you very much. Hotti: Hmm, yes... Well, then, I'll be getting back to my room then. Tell Miss Ini I said hi, OK? Hmm, yes... Phoenix: (It's time for me to leave too, hmm, yes... Ack! OK, it's definitely time to leave!) June 21Kurain Village Lotta: Hey! So how was it!? Didja go to the clinic? Phoenix: Yeah... I found out a few things... I guess... Lotta: ...What's the matter? Ya ain't lookin' so well. Ah, yeah. So earlier, that ol' granny called the cops. Phoenix: ...Huh? The cops? Why would Morgan call the police? Lotta: She said she had \"somethin' to tell 'em\". Things are sure gettin' interestin'. Talk Morgan Lotta: Ah, but honestly, I tell ya, that granny sure got her bloomers in a knot. Phoenix: Well, I guess you could put it that way... Lotta: It always starts out small, ya know? Stealin' the Master's seat, and controllin' the village folk... and now ya see what it's turned into? A murder, that's what. Phoenix: Yeah, what a mess. ... H-Hey, hold on! Lotta: What? Phoenix: That stuff you were just talking about... That's the first I've heard of it. Lotta: Heh, really? Well, it's old news to everyone else in the world. Phoenix: (Well, excuse me for not keeping up with gossip while I'm busy saving people!) Phoenix: You said something about \"stealing the Master's seat\"? Lotta: Yup. Right now, the Master is this medium named Misty Fey, but... the one that was really supposed to be the Master was that old granny. Phoenix: (Morgan was supposed to become... the Master...?) Ini Miney Phoenix: Do you know where Ini is, Lotta? Lotta: Yeah, I saw her not too long ago. She's hangin' around that garden in the middle. Phoenix: OK, thanks. Lotta: Ya got somethin' to ask her? Phoenix: (Yeah. I've got a whole list of things only she can clear up for me...) The Master (appears after \"Morgan\") Lotta: So I hear the Master has always been the oldest daughter. Phoenix: The oldest daughter...? Lotta: Turns out, that old bat is Misty Fey's older sister... Phoenix: O-Oh? Lotta: They say the older sister is usually the one with more spiritual power. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, Maya said the same thing a long time ago... She warned me not to take Mia's powers lightly...) Lotta: Well, anyway... somehow, granny there lost to her younger sister, Misty. Phoenix: I see... Lotta: This made the townsfolk turn against her, so I hear. Said all sorta things too, like, \"She's the oldest, and yet she doesn't have the power to be the next Master. Disgraceful.\" Phoenix: (Wow. I had no idea...) ...So what would've happened had Morgan been stronger...? Lotta: Maya's family woulda been the branch family, I reckon. June 21Fey ManorWinding Way Ini: Hey! Like, I haven't seen you in a while... Phoenix: Yeah. (I think I have enough to finally unlock her secret...) Ini: ...Like, what's with that scary look on your face...? Talk Traffic accident (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Ini: Yeah... I was... riding... Riding in that car... with my sister. We were... like, on our way home... I was riding in the passenger seat when I fell asleep... ...And then, it happened. At the time, I grabbed for my purse, and escaped from the passenger-side door. Phoenix: ...And your sister...? Ini: I, like, couldn't do anything... The car was full of smoke... I couldn't see anything... Phoenix: Oh, I'm sorry... Dr. Grey (appears after \"Traffic accident\") Phoenix: Did Dr. Grey really cause that accident by drugging your sister with sleeping pills? Ini: Like, he was totally out to get my sister... He totally did that to, like, pay my sister back... Phoenix: (Hmm, I wonder... This does give Ini a good reason to want to murder Dr. Grey!) Ini: Ha ha ha. It seems simple, doesn't it? Phoenix: What do you mean!? Ini: But, it would be very hard to catch me. Actually, I'd say impossible. Phoenix: What!? Ini: I think you get the picture. I'm going to serve you a slice of humble pie! I hope you enjoy it. Ha ha ha... Present Maya's Magatama Phoenix: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Traffic Accident -- Phoenix: Please tell me about the traffic accident. Ini: Huh? Like, whose accident? Phoenix: Your sister's accident, naturally! Ini: Oh... Um, oh, yeah... So, like, that Dr. Grey guy made my sister fall asleep... And, like, that's all I have to say about that. Phoenix: Hmm... (Interesting... Ini just asked, \"Whose accident?\"... Which means... She must know something about another person's accident...) Alright, let's change the topic, then. How about you tell me about a certain other person's accident? Ini: Huh? Another person's accident...? Like, you got someone in mind? Present License Photo or Ini Miney profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I want to ask you about your own car accident.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Ini: Oh wow.

Ini: Like, let's make sure we're on the same page. I, like, want proof I was in an accident. Phoenix: (I thought I'd ease into this topic, but...) It doesn't matter what you say, I know you were in a car accident! Leads back to: \"So, wow, like, how strange. I have, like, no idea what you're talking about.\" Phoenix: Would you take a look at this? It's a newspaper article from one year ago. It says, \"Ms. Ini Miney Holds Interview About Crash\".

Ini: I mean, like, this person has, like, the same name, but she's totally not me. My name, \"Ini Miney\" is, like, pretty common. Phoenix: What in the world are you babbling about!? Your sister's name, \"Mimi Miney\" is in here too! Ini: Like, totally, wow... What a scary coincidence! I'm totally getting, like, goosebumps.

Phoenix: I got this from the hospital where you were hospitalized at. Ini: H-Huh? So? Phoenix: There was a certain patient there. He's quite a fan... As a memento of your stay, he stole this. I have to say, this photo looks like you. Ini: ...That creepy fake Director! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: Now are you ready to tell me about the accident...? Ini: Like, wait a sec. OK, so, like, I was in an accident. Sure. But that's, like, totally not related to this murder! Phoenix: Actually, it is. Look at this article. It says that \"one of the women died\", correct? Ini: ...A-And? Phoenix: That woman who died -- who do you suppose they mean? Ini: ... Phoenix: Do you suppose the woman who died in that accident could be...? Present Mimi Miney profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I believe it was your sister, Mimi Miney.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you suppose it could be this person...? Ini: ... Like, no way. Phoenix: ...Huh? Ini: Like, the accident was, like, a year ago, so, like, what's this person got to do with it? I'm totally not interested in stupid people like you. Bye-bye...

Leads back to: \"Do you suppose the woman who died in that accident could be...?\" Phoenix: I believe it was your sister, Mimi Miney. Ini: Mimi...

While the murder was being committed, my aunt was outside with everyone else. Which means she already has an alibi. Phoenix: That's true... Mia: Show me some evidence that would cast suspicion onto my aunt. Present Black Key Phoenix: Phoenix: My evidence is this black key. Mia: ... Phoenix: At the beginning of the channeling, Maya had possession of this key. And yet, somehow, it magically ended up in the incinerator in the center garden. Mia: ...You're right. Phoenix: There is only one person who could have done that while I was busy calling the police. The person taking care of Maya -- Morgan. Mia: ... Phoenix: What's that look mean? Mia: Your argument is too flimsy. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: When did the key find its way into the incinerator? It could have happened long after the murder happened. Phoenix: Long after...? Mia: Someone could have found the key somewhere and dumped it into the incinerator. Phoenix: But that's... Mia: That prosecutor would use something this small to shred your case. Do you have something other than just the key to cast suspicion on Morgan? Present Cloth Scrap Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is the other piece of evidence that points to Morgan as the culprit.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Mia: Phoenix, we don't have any time left. Phoenix: (I haven't even said anything yet...) Mia: You can't pin my aunt as the murderer with one piece of evidence alone. Leads back to: \"Do you have something other than just the key to cast suspicion on Morgan?\" Phoenix: This is the other piece of evidence that points to Morgan as the culprit. Mia: ... Phoenix: I also found this in the garden incinerator. It's the same material as Maya's costume... Except for the splotch of blood. Mia: But this piece may not even be from Maya's costume. Phoenix: But this is what Maya told me. \"While I was channeling, the key was sitting inside my sleeve.\" And both this key and the piece of cloth were found inside the incinerator. Phoenix: Which means that this piece of cloth was a part of Maya's costume. Mia: But when Maya was arrested, she was wearing her costume. Phoenix: That just means someone changed her clothes. Mia: Changed her clothes? But why...? Phoenix: I don't know why. But... There is only one person who could've done that. Mia: The one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt. 1 LOCK BROKEN Leads to: \"You did very well, Phoenix.\" Present Cloth Scrap Phoenix: Phoenix: The proof is this piece of cloth. Mia: ... Phoenix: I found it in the incinerator near the Winding Way. It's the same material as Maya's costume... Except for the splotch of blood. Mia: You mean, it's from Maya's costume that she was wearing at the time of the murder? Phoenix: Yes. Mia: But when Maya was arrested, she was wearing her costume. Phoenix: That just means someone changed her clothes. Mia: Changed her clothes? But why...? Phoenix: I don't know why. But... There is only one person who could've done that. Mia: The one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt. ... Phoenix: What's that look mean? Mia: Your argument is too flimsy. Phoenix: Huh? Mia: You have no proof that this piece of cloth is actually from Maya's costume. Phoenix: But... this blood... Mia: And do you know whose blood that is at this point in time? You don't, do you? Do you have any proof that piece of cloth is from Maya's costume? Present Black Key Phoenix: Leads to: \"I think this is the proof you're looking for.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Mia: Phoenix, we don't have any time left.

Phoenix: At the beginning of the channeling, Maya had possession of this key. And yet, somehow, it magically ended up in the incinerator in the center garden. Mia: ...You're right. Phoenix: And this is what Maya told me. \"While I was channeling, the key was sitting inside my sleeve.\" And both this key and the piece of cloth were found inside the incinerator. Phoenix: Which means that this piece of cloth was a part of Maya's costume. Mia: It would certainly seem that way... Phoenix: Someone changed her into a different set of clothes. And then, burned the costume she was wearing in the incinerator. There is only one person who could've done that. Mia: The one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt. Phoenix: Exactly! 1 LOCK BROKEN Leads to: \"You did very well, Phoenix.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Um, I think this...? Mia: No. You're wrong. Try again.

Mia: Now, I'm going to ask you one more time. Leads back to: \"While the murder was being committed, my aunt was outside with everyone else.\" Mia: You did very well, Phoenix. Phoenix: Thank you. Mia: As long as you have those two pieces of evidence, you can cast suspicion on my aunt. However. Phoenix: H-However? Mia: Like I said in the beginning, my aunt has an alibi. Phoenix: Yeah... She was with us the whole time... Mia: Here's my final question. You don't have to present solid proof of this for me. But I want to know. If my aunt is the culprit, then how did she commit the murder? Phoenix: How she did it, huh...? Mia: I want to hear your thoughts. In order for my aunt to murder Dr. Grey, who or what did she need...? Present Ini Miney profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"...Ini Miney. She's the answer to the final question.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: ... (No idea... Just throwing things out now...) Mia: ...And you were so close too, Phoenix. Phoenix: Yeah... Mia: There is no way my aunt could have done it herself. So, thinking logically, where does that leave you? Should be easy for you to figure out... Phoenix: (So, if Morgan couldn't have done it herself... Then...) Mia: Come on, Phoenix. Think. Leads back to: \"In order for my aunt to murder Dr. Grey, who or what did she need...?\" Phoenix: ...Ini Miney. She's the answer to the final question. Mia: Which means that my aunt and Ini Miney... Phoenix: ...Were in cahoots! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Mia: ...Something's been bothering me all this time. This crime is something no normal person could carry out. The person would have to know a lot about Fey Manor and the village itself to do this. Phoenix: ...But Morgan already has an alibi... Mia: Yes, which is why I can't figure out how it was done. We can assume that Ini Miney is involved somehow... Phoenix: But we have one big problem on our hands. Mia: ...A problem? With what? Phoenix: We don't have a motive. Why would Morgan want to kill Dr. Grey? Why would she have to? Also, we don't really know for sure that she was cooperating with Ini. Mia: ... Phoenix: (Mia doesn't have a clue either, huh?) Mia: Hmm... Then, there is only one possibility... Phoenix: Huh!? Mia: Think about it, Phoenix. Why would my aunt do something like this? And why would she do it in such an underhanded fashion? Phoenix: Um... because...? Mia: Mother... She is the one who holds the key to this. Phoenix: Mother? Whose? Mine? Mia: Don't be silly. Mine, of course! Misty Fey. Phoenix: (Mia and Maya's mother? Why would she bring her up now...?) Mia: Now then... Looks like we've gathered everything we could. All we have to do is win tomorrow! Everything will become apparent then. Phoenix: R-Right, Chief! We won't lose! To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet...

Ini: Yeah, like, that was in May too. Like, the thing with all the patients dying was, like, May 2nd, and like, our accident was, like, on the 24th. Phoenix: Two accidents back to back... Do you assume it's just a coincidence? Ini: My sis was, like, totally tired, so that's why, duh.Ini: Like, something really bad had happened at, like, my sister's clinic around then...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That was the malpractice incident where 14 patients died, correct? Ini: Yeah. Phoenix: What was the cause of the mistake? Ini: Like, I heard it was 'cause the medicines, like, got mixed up. Phoenix: Was that the fault of your sister, Mimi Miney? Ini: Like, no way. Dr. Grey, like, wanted to blame it on my sis... von Karma: von Karma: That incident has nothing to do with our murder here. Besides, the police report has already documented that it was entirely Mimi Miney's fault. Phoenix: (Which means as far as the \"real\" facts are concerned... Mimi Miney is the one who made the mistake...) Ini: But, like, it really wasn't my sis...Ini: And like, the night of the accident, my sis was totally tired while she was driving.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She was \"totally tired\"? You mean, exhausted? Ini: Like, she had to talk to the police, and, like, was being investigated, like, every day. It was, like, a totally terrible situation. Phoenix: It's no wonder, then, that the car accident happened, huh? Press harder Phoenix: So then, why didn't you ask to switch places? Ini: Huh? Like, what are you talking about? Phoenix: I meant switch drivers. If your sister was so tired, then you should have switched with her. Judge: True, true. Ini: Ah, but like... I don't, like, have a driver's license... von Karma: This is news to me. I was not aware you didn't have your license, Ms. Miney. Judge: Hmm... Ms. Miney, please amend your testimony. Ini: Like, OK. Anyway... Adds statement \"I, like, didn't have my license, so, like, I couldn't take over driving for her.\" Leave her be Phoenix: (There's no point in asking her about her sister. I should be trying to find out more information about Ini!) Ini: So, like, can I go on? Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: Your sister... Mimi Miney, was she that exhausted? Ini: Like, she had to talk to the police, and, like, was being investigated, like, every day. It was, like, a totally terrible situation. Judge: Ah, if only you had your license and were able to drive for your sister. Ini: Y-Yeah... That was, like, too bad... von Karma: Now, then, witness. Continue with your testimony.Ini: I was, like, totally pooped too, so I, like, fell asleep in the passenger's seat...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The accident happened at night, correct...? Ini: Yeah, like, it was at, like, 1 AM or so, I think. I had, like, a paper due, like, really soon... so, like, I hadn't slept and was working, like, real hard. von Karma: So it was because the two of you were so tired that this accident happened.Ini: I, like, woke up 'cause of a jolt, and, like, it was a sea of flames around me.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And your sister? What happened to her? Ini: I... I didn't see her... The car was, like, totally black, and there was, like, a ton of smoke... I, like, totally had, like, no clue what was going on.Ini: I, like, opened the door and, like, got away.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Please tell us about your escape in more detail. Ini: I... I, like, kept wanting to forget that time, so, like, I don't remember things about the accident in, like, details anymore... Judge: Hmm, well, it's alright. No need to push yourself. Ini: I think I, like, gave an interview after the accident. Like, that would probably be the most accurate, you know? Phoenix: (Hmm, if it's that article, then I've already got it...)Ini: I, like, didn't have my license, so, like, I couldn't take over driving for her.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And that's why you were in the passenger's seat? Ini: Like, yeah. I was, like, at my college's research lab 'till, like, really late... So my sis was, like, giving me a ride home. Phoenix: I see... Mia: Phoenix. Phoenix: Y-Yes? Mia: You can't do this. You're being too easy on her.Present License Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Miney. That was a lame lie just now.\"Phoenix: (There's got to be some sort of secret sleeping in this testimony...)Mia: Yes, so let's find that one crushing contradiction and end this!Phoenix: Ms. Miney. That was a lame lie just now.Ini: Like, what do you mean?Phoenix: I know you had a license back then! This is a photo you took for the express purpose of getting a driver's license!Ini: Umm...Judge: What is the meaning of this, Ms. Miney!?Ini: Ah, um... Uh... That's... That's right! Y-Yeah, I had, like, a license... But... ... But I didn't get it until after the accident!Phoenix: No, you had it. You had it at the time of the accident! Director Hotti... or the guy pretending to be him anyway, said so!Ini: What, are you talking about that perverted fake clinic director?Phoenix: Yes, that perverted fake clinic director. And how did you know he was perverted. Eowch!von Karma: No one cares. Witness. When did you receive your driver's license?Ini: Like, last November.Phoenix: What? N-N-November...?von Karma: The accident happened last May. That's a half year lapse in time, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix: Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What in the!?Judge: Th-Th-Th-Th-That's what happened, Mr. Wright! At the time of the accident, Ms. Miney did not have a driver's license.Phoenix: Uuuuurk... OW!von Karma: Cry, and my whip will accommodate.Judge: Anyway, without a license, the witness and her sister could not have switched drivers.Ini: I'm, like, glad you get it, but... like, even if I had my license, I, like, don't think my sis woulda, like, let me drive.Phoenix: (...Hmm...) Yeow!Mia: Don't just stand there \"hmm\"-ing to yourself!Phoenix: Not you too, Mia! With the whip... And the pain... And the oww...Mia: Ms. Miney! Why do you think you would not have been allowed to drive anyway?Ini: Eh? Um... That's because...Judge: I think this situation calls for a more detailed testimony. Ms. Miney, if you please.Ini: Eh? Like, how annoying. Oops, like, sorry. Didn't mean to be mean...Witness Testimony-- I Wouldn't Be Allowed --Ini: Like, around that time, I was, like, really close to getting my license. My sis was, like, this totally big fan of cars and, like, really valued them. She, like, had just gotten this really shiny, bright red sports car. She, like, would say things like, \"No way am I letting a newb drive my car!\" So, like, that's why I ended up in the passenger's seat that night too.Judge: Hmm... I see... A bright red car for sports... Now then, the defense may question the witness.Phoenix: (Hmm... I'm not terribly knowledgeable about cars, but...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- I Wouldn't Be Allowed --Ini: Like, around that time, I was, like, really close to getting my license.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So what do you mean by, \"really close\"? Ini: Like, I had one of those \"permit\" things. I think that's what they're called. Phoenix: Um, \"permit\"? Ini: Wow, the big name lawyer boy doesn't even know what a driver's permit is!? Phoenix: Well, this lawyer never had a permit. Wah! von Karma: Ignorance is to be whipped. Phoenix: (What is with her...? All she's said in the last few minutes is utter nonsense...) Ini: So, like, may I continue?Ini: My sis was, like, this totally big fan of cars and, like, really valued them.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She \"valued\" cars? How much would you say she valued her car? Ini: Well, like, she'd flip out at, like, a drop of rain... and, like, she would notice if someone, like, touched the car door with dirty hands. Phoenix: (In that case, why bother taking the car out of the garage, ever!?) Press harder Phoenix: Why did she take such special care of the car? Ini: How can you say that!? It was a brand-spanking new car! Phoenix: ...New car? Ini: Like, you wouldn't want to, like, get it dirty, would you, Mr. Lawyer? Phoenix: (I would think that cars getting dirty is just another fact of life, but... I guess people who really love cars think otherwise...) Mia: Phoenix, try asking something of more significance, alright? Judge: Well, Ms. Miney? What kind of car was it? Leads back to cross-examination Let her be Phoenix: (I guess I just don't get what's so special about cars...) Alright, then, please testify about your sister's car. Leads back to cross-examinationIni: She, like, had just gotten this really shiny, bright red sports car.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: It was a new car...? Ini: Yeah. She had, like, just gotten it. It was, like, from the U.K. Judge: Hm? The \"U.K.\"? Were those her boyfriend's initials? (Changed from [Hm? The 'U.K.'? Was that her boyfriend's initials?] in the original release) Ini: And it was a really special model. She had waited for a whole year for it to arrive. Phoenix: (I guess her love of cars would be the obvious next topic...) Press harder Phoenix: (I really don't know anything about cars... (Changed from [But I really don't know anything about cars...] in the original release) But I had a feeling this was bound to come up!) Leads to: \"Your Honor!\" Let her be Phoenix: I see... Please continue... Mia: Hold on! Phoenix! You can't just ignore this! Phoenix: Mia... I had no idea you liked cars so much too... Mia: That's not my point! Phoenix: O-Oh, yeah! Leads to: \"Your Honor!\" Phoenix: Your Honor! Judge: Y-Yes? Phoenix: Please have the witness append what she just said to her testimony! (Changed from [Please append what the witness has just said to her testimony!] in the original release) Judge: You mean the part about it being a special import car? (Changed from [You mean the part about it being a special car from overseas?] in the original release) Phoenix: Yes! Judge: *sigh* Well, if you like cars that much, then... Phoenix: That's not my point! (Though to be honest, I don't know what the point is either...) Judge: Ms. Miney, would you please fix your testimony? Ini: Sure, whatever. Changes statement from \"She, like, had just gotten this really shiny, bright red sports car.\" to \"My sis' new car was, like, a totally special model from England.\"Ini: My sis' new car was, like, a totally special model from England.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ... (I yelled, \"Hold it\" pretty forcefully, but... I don't actually know what to ask about cars...) Ask for the heck of it Phoenix: Um... So, yes... (What am I supposed to pick for a topic...?) Let's start with this. Why are British cars good? Ini: Like, huh? Phoenix: They're expensive, and their driver's seat is opposite to our cars here in the States. It would seem there is no benefit to owning one. Ini: Like... Huh? Phoenix: This whole steering wheel on the right side thing; it's kind of goofy, isn't it? Ini: Y-You! What do you know!? That sleek shape! The purr of the engine! The wild way it starts! And its smooth handling! The raw feeling of manual transmission! The cool breeze of the AC! Phoenix: Uuugh... Forgive me... (Her personality really changes at the drop of a hat...) Mia: It's interesting, isn't it, Phoenix? Bit by bit, we're beginning to see the real \"contradiction\" behind this case. Leads back to cross-examination Leave it alone Phoenix: (I really stink at talking about cars... If I ask the wrong question, I might make someone mad...) Judge: Ms. Miney, I believe you may continue with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examinationPresent Newspaper Clipping 2 Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Miney.\"Ini: She, like, would say things like, \"No way am I letting a newb drive my car!\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was your sister good at driving? Ini: She was, like, totally awesome! She, like, said she was going to be the, like, \"Racing Queen of the Nursing World\". Phoenix: (...Somehow, I think she bumped my question off-track again...)Ini: So, like, that's why I ended up in the passenger's seat that night too.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And that was when the accident occurred, correct? Ini: Like, yeah... I, like, immediately reached for the passenger side door, and fled, like, in a daze... Judge: Hmm... Sounds like you had a terrifying time...Present Newspaper Clipping 2 (after changing third statement) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Miney.\"Mia: There is something very big here. It's going to be hard to break apart such a natural-sounding testimony. But we have to attack it. And by doing so, a flaw will show itself. It has to.Phoenix: D-Do you really think so?Mia: Believe. There is a path, I know it.Phoenix: (Hmm... Mia almost sounded like a prophet for a second there...)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant until a year ago.

Edgeworth: (...It's time.) Gumshoe: Don't worry, Mr. Edgeworth! I'll be following your every movement with my binoculars! Edgeworth: Good to hear. Now make sure you don't lose sight of me. I'm counting on you for backup. Gumshoe: You can count on me, sir! Edgeworth: I have to go. The kidnapper is supposed to contact me soon. (Who would've thought that upon my return, I'd be thrust into a kidnapping case. And that I would be the one who would have to make the ransom drop-off...) Edgeworth: (Let's see... I checked that the money is all there, safe inside this suitcase... Now all I have to do is await further instructions from the kidnapper... ...which I'm expecting to be transferred to my cell phone. I wonder who else is around? This is the meeting place, after all...) ???: Welcome to Gatewater Land! Edgeworth: Hm? Oh, thank you. ???: And a big hello to you! I'm the Proto Badger! Nice to meet you! ............ Edgeworth: ............ Proto B.: Excuse me, but were you perhaps thinking of taking a picture of me? Edgeworth: A picture...? Of you...? Sorry, but I'm not interested. Proto B.: Aww, that's too bad. Well, have a good day! Edgeworth: ...Hello? ???: ...Who aRE yOu? YoU'Re nOt ERNesT AmaNo! Edgeworth: (It sounds like the kidnapper is using some sort of voice alteration device...) I'm his representative, Miles Edgeworth. ???: ...ARE YoU a cOP? Edgeworth: No, I'm......... a prosecutor. ???: ............ Edgeworth: ............ I know what you're wondering, and yes, I have brought the ransom money with me. ???: I SeE... In THAt caSe, bRIng thE mOnEy wiTh You to tHe StaDIum. Edgeworth: (So this person intends to see if I'm being followed, huh. Please, Detective Gumshoe... I really need you to come through for me this one time.) Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth speaking. ???: NeXT, ComE to THe HaUNteD HOUsE. Edgeworth: And just how long do you intend to have me wander around for? ???: ThAt'S fOr mE To dECIdE. YoU dON't hAVE MucH of A cHOIce hERe, mY fRIeNd. Edgeworth: I suppose not. Edgeworth: ...I've arrived. ???: ...Go iNsIDe. Edgeworth: (Hmph. What a dismal place...) ???: ThaT'S IT. GO thROuGh tHOsE DooRs... Edgeworth: (Am I being watched from somewhere?) ???: LeAVe tHe MoNEy aND GO. NoW. Edgeworth: Nnngh............ .................. (I was hoping for an exchange, but maybe I should do as they say for now and not push it.) Edgeworth: (I couldn't catch even a glimpse of the kidnapper. Perhaps I should keep an eye on this haunted house until police backup arrives.) Edgeworth: (Agh! It was a trap!) March 13, 11:23 AM ???????????? Examine evidence Prosecutor's Badge Front of badge Edgeworth: This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so. Back of badge Edgeworth: Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else! ???: That guy... betrayed... ???: No... can't be... Then the deal... Edgeworth: (Who is that...? And what are they talking about...?) ???: ...split... police... ???: ...Alright... ???: ...in front of... meet up... Edgeworth: (...I can't move my body... ...I-I fear I may faint again...) Edgeworth: Where am I...? (How long was I out...? It wasn't raining like it is now when I made the drop-off... This was supposed to be a simple affair... ...so why have I been taken hostage as well!? I can only assume Detective Gumshoe lost sight of me at some point.) Edgeworth: The only reason I agreed to be the drop-off man was because of that phone call. It was from Mr. Ernest Amano, the director of the powerful zaibatsu, the Amano Group. But aside from that, I also owe him a great debt of gratitude. His only son, Lance, had been kidnapped. I know that Lance is already in his twenties, but I guess some things you never grow out of. Edgeworth: .................. (I can't sit around waiting for someone to come help me! I must escape somehow...) ...Nnnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!! ???: Hahaha! Was that you making that funny sound!? Edgeworth: ............Who's there!? And how dare you laugh at a gentleman's plight!? ...Who are you? Are you one of the kidnappers? ???: A kidnapper? Me? No way! I'm not into such petty crimes. Nope! I'm after something much, much bigger! Edgeworth: .................. (Argh! I must be worn out from today's ordeal. Focus, Miles!) ???: Oh, I forgot to introduce myself! Sorry about that! Ahem! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: Great Thief? (And did she really just claim to be the Yatagarasu?) Kay: Oh, but my real name is Kay Faraday. You can call me \"Kay\", 'kay!? Good! Glad that's settled! Edgeworth: .................. Not quite. I have a mountain of questions for you... ...but first, if you would be so kind as to remove these ropes. Kay: Hmm... I wonder... Should I remove them? I was actually having a lot of fun watching you make those silly faces... Edgeworth: .................. Kay: Hey! There's no need to get all mad and icy glare-y on me, you know! This rope goes through here, and... there you go! Edgeworth: What a relief. I owe you my thanks. Kay: Ah, it's OK. You can pay me back in full later! Edgeworth: (Now then... What question should I start with? Unfortunately, I can already tell nothing is going to be easy with this cheeky girl...) Talk Great Thief Edgeworth: You call yourself a Great Thief, yet are you really a thief at all? Kay: You doubt me? I get it! You think that a young lady like me couldn't possibly be such a big-time thief, right? Edgeworth: (That's... not the part I have a tough time believing...) Kay: I am the real, genuine Yatagarasu, you know. Yup! I'm a pure-blooded Great Thief! It's a little something I inherited from my predecessor. Edgeworth: In that case... you wouldn't mind if I arrested you then, right? Kay: What!? Of course I'd mind! I haven't stolen anything yet! Seriously, I don't know how you can (changed from [can you] in the original release, correcting the typo) say such a horrible thing to your savior! Edgeworth: (That's true. Technically, she hasn't stolen anything in front of me... yet.) Yatagarasu (appears after \"Great Thief\") Edgeworth: When you say you're the \"Yatagarasu\", do you mean you are THE Yatagarasu...? Kay: Yup! The most righteous of the righteous! The legendary Great Thief! But I inherited the title only recently (changed from [the title was only recently succeeded to me] in the original release)... ...so I haven't had a chance to steal anything yet as the second Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: (I was not aware that thieves could pass down their titles like that...) Kay: But don't worry! I've got some big plans in the works! Edgeworth: Big plans, huh? They wouldn't happen to lead to a big arrest, would they? Kay: I knew it! There's just no reasoning with a prosecutor. Edgeworth: I'm not the problem here! Kay: I'll have you know that the Yatagarasu has no interest in stealing petty trinkets! There's one thing and only one thing I want to steal! Edgeworth: (Only one thing? And what would that be?) Kay: But that's going to have to wait until we find our way out of here! Edgeworth: Well, at least there is one thing we agree on. I'm sure I'll have plenty of time later to learn more about you. Present Anything Kay: Don't surprise me like that! I can't believe you're just shoving things in my face! I mean, aren't there more pressing things you'd rather ask little ol' me? Edgeworth: (She has a point... I should probably find out more about my mysterious savior first.) After clearing \"Yatagarasu\" Talk option: Kay: So, you never told me what your name is, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: Ah, I guess not. I'm Miles Edgeworth. Kay: Aha! Now I remember! Edgeworth: (...How can you \"remember\" something I just told you...? But she sure is cheery.) Kay: Alright, then Mr. Edgeworth, let's get outta here! ............Hm? Edgeworth: ...It would seem that we are locked in from the other side. Kay: What!? No way! I don't hear you! La la la! Edgeworth: Kay, you do remember where you came in from, right...? It looks like that might be our only way out of this room... Kay: Whoops, slight miscalculation. That's a good height to make an entrance from, but I can't jump that high to make an exit! Edgeworth: ...*sigh* I suppose we have no choice but to look around and see if we can't find another way out. Begin Investigation Isolation Room Talk Kay Faraday Present anything Kay: Hey! Don't you think getting out of here is more important right now!? You can ask me about that later! Edgeworth: (I suppose she's right...) Examine Cell phone Leads to: \"Hm? Isn't this my phone?\" Lockers Kay: Man! Why did they have to put the windows so high up, anyway!? How is a thief supposed to make her daring escape!? Edgeworth: I suppose we could make our way out if we were able to climb on top of these lockers. Kay: Haha! That's pretty clever! You'd make a good thief yet, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Please don't ever place my name and the word \"thief\" in the same sentence again. Kay: Let's see... I wonder if I can jump and grab the top of the locker here... Man! Why did they have to make such ginormous lockers, anyway!? Edgeworth: (Even if we wanted to use these lockers, we'd need some sort of foothold (Lockers - If we can get to the top, then we can escape. If only there were some footholds...)...) Boxes Kay: Hey! There's something inside the bottom-right box. Oh, I think it's a Pink Badger costume! Edgeworth: Pink Badger...? Kay: You don't keep up with what's going on in the world, do you? In that case, you'd better study up on the whole Badger clan with this! Edgeworth: What is this thing? Kay: Think of it as a bible of all the things you'll ever need to know about the clan! Edgeworth: (...Whatever. I suppose I can keep it as a reference guide or something.) Blue Badger Bible data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: I suppose this means that this is where they keep all the costumes? Kay: It certainly looks that way! It's like the Badger family's home! Edgeworth: (There are eight boxes, but seven of them are empty. Which means that seven of the costumes (Costumes - It seems that the costumes of the Badger family are kept in the Isolation Room.) are in use right now.) But aren't these Badgers the mascots of the police force? Kay: Well, I heard that the police had a hand in sponsoring this theme park. Probably because the Gatewater Group owes the police from all those cases they solved. Edgeworth: They have all the power of the state, and they used it to make a theme park!? Kay: It's not just any theme park! They have a handcuff-shaped, double-looping roller coaster... Edgeworth: That's quite enough. I'm feeling woozy from just the thought of such a thing. (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Key Edgeworth: And what have we here...? Kay: Ah! .................. Edgeworth: (Why do I feel a laser-like stare aimed right at me?) D-Did you want to take a look? Kay: Well, don't mind if I do! Ooh! I see! Yes, this is definitely...! A key (Tiny key - I may be able to open something, somewhere in this room with this key.)! I'm sure it's a key to something! Edgeworth: The \"something\" is what is relevant to my interest... Blue Badger boxes Kay: Look! It's the Blue Badger! Edgeworth: (I suppose even this thing can be popular with women.) Kay: My nemesis (changed from [I can't stand him] in the original release)! Edgeworth: Wh-What in the...!? (Why is she beating it (changed from [suddenly beating the Blue Badger's image] in the original release) up!?) Kay: He's got the word \"badge\" right in his name! That [sic] nothing but bad news for someone like me! (changed from [How bad is that for a girl like me!?] in the original release) And to think he's out there wandering around in this park... I'd better be careful, or he's going to arrest me by the power of his name alone! Edgeworth: (I somehow doubt that the Blue Badger has the power to arrest anyone.) Bad Badger boxes Edgeworth: So this is the Blue Badger's rival, the Bad Badger, huh. Do you feel some sort of reverence towards this Badger, Kay? Kay: ...Hah! I can't believe you would be so stereotypical when it comes to thieves! Surely you must also think there are much cooler, and cuter ones out there, right? That's it! I've decided that thieves and thievery need an image makeover! Edgeworth: (...Good luck with that one.) Proto Badger boxes Edgeworth: This is that Blue Badger I met at the main gate. Kay: Excuse me, but his name is \"Proto Badger\", not \"Blue Badger\"! He's based off of the very first design created by the local police chief. You know, when you compare the two, the Blue Badger looks a bit cuter! Edgeworth: I suppose as he continued to redesign him, the chief managed to make him cuter and cuter. Even humanity has come a long way when you think about how much we've evolved. Kay: Are we comparing the Blue Badger to humans now...? Pink Badger boxes Edgeworth: I suppose this is the Pink Badger? But since it has the same design, doesn't it seem forced to call this one a female? Kay: You think so? I mean, just look at how long her eyelashes are! Edgeworth: That's the only difference. Kay: And the fact that she's pink. Edgeworth: Yes, and? Kay: And her lips are red! See, lipstick! Edgeworth: .................. (What? She has nothing to say about the giant pink ribbon, or is that too obvious?) Boxes (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Boxes (subsequent times, after examining key) Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Beam Edgeworth: This is the beam I was tied to. ............ Kay: Hm? What's up? Edgeworth: I was pondering if perhaps we could make it over to and out the window if we climbed this. Kay: Good thinking! And if it's climbing action you need, just leave it to me! Edgeworth: Thanks. This little hook looks like it might make for a good foothold. Up you go, Kay, and good luck! Kay: Count on it! The Great Thief Yatagarasu spreads her mighty wings, and takes to the skies! Here I go! Kay: ............ Edgeworth: As I thought, this beam (The beam I was tied to - There is a hook on this beam, but it's not enough of a foothold to climb out with.) was definitely not made for climbing. Kay: What do you mean, \"As I thought\"!? I'm not your guinea pig, you know! Beam (subsequent times) Edgeworth: This is the beam I was tied to. ............ Just maybe, we can use this to climb up to and out the window. Kay: Leave it to me! ...............Wait. Didn't I just try this!? I can't climb this thing! Edgeworth: (I suppose we'll just have to find another way to escape.) Bad Badger head Edgeworth: What is this...? Kay: Looks like the Bad Badger, and it's looking as bad as ever! Edgeworth: Looks like a costume head to me. Kay: I guess the Bad Badger's costume is, at the very least, a two-piece, huh. Edgeworth: (The real question is, why is only the head sitting out here on the floor?) Bad Badger's Head data jotted down in my Organizer. Bad Badger head (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What is this...? Kay: Looks like the Bad Badger, and it's looking as bad as ever! Edgeworth: Looks like a costume head to me. Kay: I guess the Bad Badger's costume is, at the very least, a two-piece, huh. Edgeworth: (The real question is, why is only the head sitting out here on the floor?) Paint cans Kay: Maybe we can use this paint to help us escape... Edgeworth: And what exactly do you have in mind? Kay: Well, we could paint \"HELP\" in really giant letters! Edgeworth: And who, pray tell, would see these giant letters? We're inside a building. Kay: OK, then how about we light the paint on fire and send out colored smoke signals! Anyone who saw it would think some crazy arsonist was about, and call the cops! Hmm... Actually, that may not be all that great for me, seeing as I'm a thief and all. Edgeworth: ...Let's try to find something other than this paint to use, shall we? Photo rally sign Edgeworth: They're holding a Blue Badger photo rally? Kay: You didn't know? Plus, it's not just the Blue Badger, it's his whole family, too. If you manage to snap a shot of every member of the family, you get a really posh prize. Edgeworth: Well, there's a costume head sitting over there. Why not start with a picture of that? Kay: You can't do that! That's cheating! There's only one of each Badger in the park, so you have to work for it! Edgeworth: Speaking of Badgers, there was one sitting against a wall in the haunted house. Kay: Seriously? But somehow, I don't think that one counts, Mr. Edgeworth! You have to take pictures of the costumed ones walking around the park! Edgeworth: (Hmm... So these are the rules of this game? How quaint...) Badger Photo Rally data jotted down in my Organizer. Photo rally sign (subsequent times) Edgeworth: They're holding a Blue Badger photo rally? Kay: You didn't know? Plus, it's not just the Blue Badger, it's his whole family, too. If you manage to snap a shot of every member of the family, you get a really posh prize. Edgeworth: Well, there's a costume head sitting over there. Why not start with a picture of that? Kay: You can't do that! That's cheating! There's only one of each Badger in the park, so you have to work for it! Edgeworth: Speaking of Badgers, there was one sitting against a wall in the haunted house. Kay: Seriously? But somehow, I don't think that one counts, Mr. Edgeworth! You have to take pictures of the costumed ones walking around the park! Edgeworth: (Hmm... So these are the rules of this game? How quaint...) Door Edgeworth: Nnrgh... It seems that we won't be able to open this by ourselves. It also seems quite thick, so we can't just break it down. (There must be another way out of here.) Edgeworth: (Hm? Isn't this my phone? It looks like it made it through the ordeal intact.) Kay: If only there was [sic] a way for us to contact someone on the outside... Edgeworth: Ah, but we do have a way... right here. Kay: Ah! There was a cell phone here this whole time!? Edgeworth: If I'm right, Detective Gumshoe should have contacted the precinct for backup by now. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Are you OK!? I was so worried, sir! Edgeworth: I'm fine. I was knocked unconscious for a spell by the kidnapper, that's all. Gumshoe: I'm sorry, sir! I'm such a failure! If only I hadn't lost sight of you...! Edgeworth: Detective, we don't have time for this. Have the police set up a perimeter right now! Gumshoe: You don't have to worry about that, sir! I already got the boys working on that! But in doing that... I sorta... Aaaah...! Edgeworth: What's wrong, Detective? ???: ...Sorry to butt in, but I'm afraid you're going to have to make do (changed from [make due] in the original release, correcting the typo) with me. Edgeworth: Who is this? Lang: Shi-Long Lang of Interpol. A pleasure to speak with you, Mr. Edgeworth. I've heard a great deal about you. Edgeworth: So why exactly is an Interpol agent like yourself involved in a domestic kidnapping case? Lang: Don't sweat the details. A crime's a crime whether it's on a local or a global scale. Besides... ...you're the one who's in a world of trouble. Edgeworth: A-And why would you say that!? Lang: Lang Zi says: \"The pack that runs together, stays together.\" You catch my drift? You caused quite a ruckus by running blindly into a situation and then getting caught. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Lang: You should've contacted the police from the very beginning. Edgeworth: I'm sorry that this happened because of a lapse in judgement. However, I humbly request that you please help me out of here posthaste. Lang: ......Sorry, no can do. Edgeworth: What!? Lang: We're hunting the kidnapper now, and I haven't got any hands to spare. As I said, my pack moves as one. You're the one who wanted to go it alone, so good luck to you... Mr. Prosecutor. Oh, and once we do catch the kidnapper, rest assured we'll come find you... eventually. Edgeworth: ...You... You... Kay: What's wrong? Did you get cut off!? Edgeworth: No... My phone ran out of power. Kay: No way! Edgeworth: It doesn't matter anyway. We should try to get out of here through our own means. Kay: Yeah! I have a name to live up to, after all! If we put our heads together, we're sure to find a way out! Talk Kay Faraday The kidnapping (appears after examining cell phone, Bad Badger head, and photo rally sign) Edgeworth: Do you know where the person who kidnapped me went? Kay: Well, after they locked you up in here... ...it sounded like they went into the next room, and started talking to someone. Edgeworth: (I feel like I heard something as well, but it's all a haze in my mind. However, I do recall that the kidnapper was talking with someone... It was just a guess before, but I guess I really AM dealing with two kidnappers here.) Kay: After that, they left. It almost seemed as if they were done with you. Edgeworth: I suppose that is the case, as my kidnapping seems like an afterthought to the $1 million. Well, if they went into the next room, let's see what we can find out through the slot. Examine Door (after clearing \"The kidnapping\" Talk option) Kay: Ooh, we can peer into the room the kidnappers were in from there! Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Beam Edgeworth: There is a beam in the next room identical to the one in this room. There's even a hook on it to hold a propped-up floor panel in place. Which reminds me... Kay: Did you find something useful, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Hmm, perhaps. I may have found a very handy hint to how we'll get out of here. Hatch Edgeworth: Is that what I think it is? Kay: It looks like the kidnappers had an escape tunnel prepared just in case. That's awesome! They're like a bunch of Great Thieves themselves! Edgeworth: No, they're not, because I highly doubt they made the tunnel themselves. The floor panel was removed and propped up (Open floor panel - The panel is held in place by a hook. The entrance to an underground room perhaps?) against the beam in a very specific way. I think this building was originally built with a basement or underground area. Gray door Edgeworth: There's a door on the opposite side that appears to be the same as this one. Which would mean... ...that I can probably assume that these two rooms are very similar in structure. (I believe I may have just found our ticket out.) Door (subsequent times, after examining hatch) Kay: Ooh, we can peer into the room the kidnappers were in from there! Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Logic Connect \"Open floor panel\" and \"The beam I was tied to\" Leads to: \"This hook on this beam...\" Edgeworth: This hook on this beam... Kay: You know I already tried, and there's no way I can jump from this hook to the window! Come on, even you have to admit when something's just not possible. Edgeworth: Hah, I wasn't about to suggest that again. Rather, that it's here for a different purpose. Kay: Really!? Like what!? Edgeworth: As you saw in the adjacent room, it's clearly for keeping a floor panel propped up. Which means that there should be a panel in this room that we can open as well. Kay: Oh! I get it! Edgeworth: We didn't notice its existence all this time because it was being hidden by this tarp. Kay: Alright then! Let's fold this thing up and see what's underneath! Kay: Now THIS is what I call a treasure! Examine Closed hatch Kay: Wow, this must be another entrance to the secret, hidden basement! I totally smell treasure! Edgeworth: The scent I wish to smell is the sweet fragrance of freedom. Kay: Then what are you waiting for!? Hurry up and open the hatch! Edgeworth: Alright. .........Mmnph. This thing is locked down tight (Underground entrance - We might be able to escape through here, but the door is locked.). Kay: Aww! Fiddlesticks! Logic Connect \"Tiny key\" and \"Underground entrance\" Leads to: \"I believe you're up, Kay.\" Edgeworth: I believe you're up, Kay. Kay: Huh? Why me? Edgeworth: Because we need to use the tiny key that you've taken quite a liking to. Kay: Oh, gotcha! Just leave it to me! I love the tense feeling of these moments when you're about to uncover something big! Edgeworth: I believe the feeling of freedom would be much more satisfying right about now. Kay: Alright! I got the secret door open! And now...! Edgeworth: Ack! Wait! Kay: Wha--!? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: Are you alright!? Kay!? Kay: I'm fine. The ladder just slipped is all! Edgeworth: (Thank goodness she's alright. I about had a coronary...) Kay: There's a lot of really large machinery down here. Edgeworth: What about an exit? Kay: Umm... It's really dark and cramped down there, so I really doubt there's an exit. Argh, I can't believe that happened! Edgeworth: You have only yourself to blame for leaping before you looked, you know. Kay: No way! I mean, how was I supposed to know that the ladder is removable (Underground ladder - It looks as though it can be easily removed, but is it really safe to use...?)!? Examine Open hatch Edgeworth: (I finally got the door to the underground area open...) Kay, I just want to confirm with you that there wasn't an exit down there. Kay: Yeah, it was really cramped, and there was a lot of really large machinery. Edgeworth: I see. Are you hurt at all? Kay: I'm perfectly fine! I was just a little surprised when the ladder suddenly slipped out from under me... Edgeworth: (I wonder if this ladder can be put to some use...) Logic Connect \"Lockers\" and \"Underground ladder\" Leads to: \"I've figured out how we will escape this prison, Kay.\" Edgeworth: I've figured out how we will escape this prison, Kay. Kay: Oh? So, how are we going to bust out? Edgeworth: It seems that your reckless actions were of use after all. Kay: ...Are you actually praising me? Edgeworth: More of a \"thank you\" for giving me an idea regarding this ladder. Kay: The underground ladder? What about it? Edgeworth: This ladder isn't just for those who wish to go down... Kay: Oh! I see! If we use this...! Edgeworth: Yes, I believe it's long enough to reach the top of those lockers. Kay: Well, then what are we waiting for!? Investigation Complete Kay: Alright! Now we can get out of here! Edgeworth: Yes... We spent entirely too much time in here. (Kidnappers who held me hostage, and a mysterious Interpol agent... This case is only getting started, and I'll be the one to bring it to a resounding end!) March 13, 12:11 PM Wild, Wild West Area Edgeworth: It looks like it's stopped raining for now. Kay: Yeah, and thank goodness! You have no idea how hard it was raining earlier! ???: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm so glad to see you managed to escape, sir! I was so stressed that I thought my heart was gonna give out! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, may I ask what in the world that is? Gumshoe: Well, that's... um... MIB: Count off! 1! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 98! 99! MIB: Shifu! All 99 members are here and accounted for, sir! ???: Heh... What the heck do you think you're doing counting my cubs off like that!? Every person is a valuable human being, you get me? And everyone has a name that their parents gave to them. No one is a 2 or a 3... Everyone, regardless of age or rank, is number 1! Got it!? Shifu! Shifu! Edgeworth: ...You are Agent Lang, I take it? MIB: You infidel! How dare you address our Shifu so rudely!? Lang: Grr! Lang Zi says: \"A cub who disrespects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder.\" So don't you ever forget to show the proper respect towards another person! Shih-na. This isn't much, but please accept my card. Edgeworth: Oh, thank you. ...Please, accept mine in return. Lang: You all see that just now!? That is the proper way for two people to show their respect! Keep that in mind and you'll get far in life, got it!? Edgeworth: (Ah, that's right... Franziska did warn me... Something about an elite Interpol Agent from the Republic of Zheng Fa. Apparently, this man has the highest successful arrest rate in the organization.) Agent Lang, why exactly is an Interpol agent involved with this clearly domestic case? Lang: That's none of your business, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: How is it not!? Lang: I've heard a rumor or two about you. You solved a murder that occurred during your flight home recently, right? Hah! But you sure took a while just to arrest one little flight attendant. How pathetic. Gumshoe: H-How dare you say that about Mr. Edgeworth!? Are you saying you could've solved it faster, pal!? Lang: The comedic relief jumps to the aid (changed from [aide] in the original release) of his master... How cliché. Look, what I'm getting at is that if I had been there, no one would've died. Edgeworth: ! Lang: I would've solved the entire case and Agent Hicks would still be with us here today. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang knew yesterday's victim, Agent Akbey Hicks...?) Lang: Hicks was like a brother to me, so now, I'm out to take my revenge! Edgeworth: (Agent Hicks was investigating a smuggling ring with Franziska and a third person... This must be the man she was talking about.) In that case, you should understand how I feel, as the kidnapped is someone I know. So I ask that you please allow me to participate in the investigation... Lang: Lang: This isn't your neatly trimmed Courtroom of Eden, you know. You're out in the wilderness now, Mr. Prosecutor, and way out of your league. No hard feelings, but why don't you go on back to your courtroom now, pretty boy? Edgeworth: You...! You dare to mock the court!? Lang: I do... And I don't need the help of a filthy \"prosecutor\". Sorry, but the truth doesn't need the likes of you to distort it today! Edgeworth: (Who uses the adjective \"filthy\" to describe a prosecutor...!? And why...? Why do I feel such intense loathing emanating from him!?) Lang: Alright, men! Good job on the perimeter around Gatewater Land. Now just find me the kidnapper, and bring the punk to me! Dismissed! Sir! Lang: Now then, Mr. Prosecutor, you just sit tight here and don't cause any trouble, understand? Edgeworth: W-Wait! Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: It's been a while since I last met someone so disagreeable. (Why of all places did he show up here? And completely out of the blue at that! I suppose I'll have to ask Detective Gumshoe to fill me in on that.) Talk Kay Faraday Kay: Maaaan... I can't calmly do any stealing at all with that detective around. Edgeworth: I suppose it's not easy when there's this many members of law enforcement in the vicinity. Kay: It's alright! It's not like I'm in a hurry to steal just any ol' thing! Edgeworth: (...Which is it? Do you plan to steal something or not? Quite the mystery, this one. Maybe I should talk with her a bit more.) Talk Next step Kay: So what are you going to do about your investigation into the kidnapping? Edgeworth: Good question. Since Agent Lang holds the authority to investigate this case now... ...this makes things a bit more complicated. Kay: Oh, come on, you can't let that stop you! I'll even lend you a hand, so let's go! Edgeworth: But you're a self-purported \"Great Thief\", are you not? I don't believe I can let someone of an unlawful nature participate in an investigation. Kay: You don't like to listen, do you? I'm not just any ol' (changed from [ordinary] in the original release) Great Thief; I'm the Yatagarasu! And as I said earlier... ...the Yatagarasu is after one and only one thing. \"One and only one\" (appears after \"Next step\") Edgeworth: What is this \"one and only one\" thing you're after? Kay: The Yatagarasu is only interested in one thing... ...and that is the truth. Edgeworth: I see...  Edgeworth: It was seven years ago... There was a vigilante who threw the business world into a panic. Labeled \"mysterious\" and \"phantom-like\", the Yatagarasu appeared and vanished at will. Though we still don't know much about this thief's ultimate goal, we do know the targets. The Yatagarasu liked to find and publicly disclose (changed from [make public,] in the original release) evidence of corrupt dealings of all sorts. Once a target was chosen, no dramatic calling card or announcement was sent forth. Instead, the chosen corporation was infiltrated without even the target noticing. Some days later, the evidence that was found was sent out to the mass media... ...along with a card with the mark of a three-legged raven. Looking back, I suppose you could call what the Yatagarasu was stealing the \"truth\". (Could this child really be the successor to the original Yatagarasu? But that can't be... can it...?) Present Prosecutor's Badge Kay: If I had one of these, I could be a prosecutor, too, right? Edgeworth: Don't even think of stealing this from me. Kay: If it's that important to you, then why don't you wear it on your lapel? Edgeworth: (Why should I have to label myself as a prosecutor everywhere I go? And why does everyone ask that question of me? That's what I'D like to know.) Gatewater Land Pamphlet Kay: I really love theme parks! Too bad we're not here to have a fun time... Edgeworth: So why did you choose this one, and why choose to show yourself to me of all people? Kay: Because I was tailing you, silly! Duh! Edgeworth: You were following me!? (But why?) Blue Badger Bible Kay: It's a book of information about my arch-enemy, the Blue Badger. But I won't lose to the likes of him! You just wait and see. I'm going to write a \"Tome of Thievery\"! How's that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...The information that winds up on your wanted poster will suffice in this competition.) Badger Photo Rally Kay: Come on! The Badger family is waiting for us to find and take pictures of them! And remember, you have to yell, \"Badger GET!\" each time, or it doesn't count! Edgeworth: They even have a rule for when you take their pictures...? Kay: Tell me about it! I was planning to steal all of my shots, as any proper Great Thief should! Edgeworth: (Does the concept of stealing permeate every aspect of this girl's life...?) Anything else Kay: What do you think about this? Edgeworth: If you're going to steal anything, at least keep your hands off of my lines. Kay: Alright, alright. I'll return it to you. Here you go! Edgeworth: (I was hoping for some information in return, but my line will do for now.) Dick Gumshoe Edgeworth: Great job, Detective. Gumshoe: Sir! Edgeworth: For losing sight of me and the kidnapper, and allowing my investigation to be hijacked. Gumshoe: I... Sir...! Edgeworth: I look forward to your next month's salary assessment. Gumshoe: But... But the case isn't lost yet, sir! I'm gonna show you just how much of a man Dick Gumshoe can be! Edgeworth: Shall I prepare the 21-gun salute now or later? Talk Agent Lang Edgeworth: Detective, are you sure it was the precinct you called for backup? Gumshoe: O-Of course, sir! I think I would know the number to my own precinct like back of my hand! Edgeworth: Then why did an Interpol agent show up instead, with an army of his own agents? Gumshoe: That, I have no idea... About five minutes after I made the call, that wolf-man showed up out of nowhere, sir. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang definitely has an agenda, so the question is, \"What is he after?\") Next step (appears after \"Agent Lang\") Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! I was wondering if I may ask about one thing, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, what is it? Gumshoe: Um... Who is that? The girl over there, I mean. Kay: I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant, Kay Faraday! Gumshoe: Wh-Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: Funny, I don't recall making you my assistant, Kay... Gumshoe: Yeah! I'M Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! ME! It's been like that since... forever! Kay: Sorry, but I just stole your supporting role. Gumshoe: How can you say something so serious with that giant grin on your face, pal!? Mr. Edgeworth! We've got a thief on our hands, sir! She stole my role, sir! I'm taking her in, getting her convicted, and making sure she serves out her sentence! Kay: Oh, come on, it'll be fun! Like musical chairs! You'd better stay fast on your feet! Gumshoe: No way! I won't... I will not lose the spotlight to you, little girl! Present Prosecutor's Badge Gumshoe: If you're going to show me your Prosecutor's Badge, then I'll show you my police badge! Edgeworth: ...Your wallet is looking rather thin, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? Oh, whoops. I must've left my badge at home. I always get the two mixed up. Ha ha. Edgeworth: That's not a laughing matter, Detective! Gatewater Land Pamphlet Gumshoe: Gatewater Land... Who would have guessed this place would be such a success? But the Gatewater Group and I go way back, you know? Edgeworth: Yes... Same here. I handled two murder cases that took place at two of their hotels. And it was you who headed the investigation in each case. Gumshoe: Oh, I remember that, sir! I was 16 back then, standing in front of the hotel in the snow... Edgeworth: (...Clearly, we are not on the same page here.) Blue Badger Bible Gumshoe: You actually got a copy, Mr. Edgeworth!? Ooh! Can you show me the very last page!? Edgeworth: The last page? Very well... Let's see here... ...Interesting. Why is your name listed here under \"Special Thanks\"? Gumshoe: That's it, sir! You found it! Oh... Um... That's because I did the choreography for the \"Dance, Dance, Blue Badger\" song! Edgeworth: (I suspect that no one entrusts him with any real responsibilities at work...) Badger Photo Rally Gumshoe: Oh, are you participating in the photo rally, too, Mr. Edgeworth!? Um... I mean, I'm only doing it as part of my duties! Yeah. Edgeworth: ...I see. In that case, keep up the good work. So, how many have you found so far? Gumshoe: I've been sorta busy with the investigation, so I haven't really found any yet, but... Edgeworth: (Something tells me finding the Badgers isn't really a part of his duties.) Anything else Gumshoe: I'm sorry, sir! Absolutely nothing is coming to mind right now! As a man, the only thing I can attest to is this: \"To be a man, I, Dick Gumshoe, will tell no lie!\" Edgeworth: (His heart's in the right place... Now to work on his deduction skills.) Officers Edgeworth: Excuse me, but if you could just let me through here... Officer: Sorry, I can't let anyone through. Agent Lang's orders. Edgeworth: Nnngh... (I suppose I'll have to deal with this impasse for now.) Blue Badger Blue Badger: .................. Edgeworth: (That wriggling... I just can't bring myself to call it \"dancing\"...) Examine Barrels on left side Edgeworth: I highly doubt I'll find a clue in here, but I might as well check, just to be sure. ...Mnngh. This barrel sure is heavy. You there! Do you know what's inside of this thing? Officer: It's the emergency water supply for putting out fires. Edgeworth: ...I see. Well, they certainly are well prepared. Horizontal bar Edgeworth: This horizontal bar is used... for tying up horses. Apparently, you can ride real horses at the Cowboy's Ranch area just up ahead. Is it possible that the culprits have already escaped with the help of a stolen horse or two? Officer: Under Agent Lang's orders, we already rounded up all the horses... ...and every last one has been accounted for. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang is good, although, I won't go so far as to say I'm impressed just yet...) Rocking chair Edgeworth: It's an old-fashioned rocking chair, the kind that makes you feel instantly at ease. There's something written here... \"A soothing 10-minute sitting for only $100\"...!? I see. Reverse psychology. Make it so expensive that no one would dare sit on it... Barrels by cactus Edgeworth: It's an empty barrel. I'd venture to guess that its only purpose is to set the mood. Cactus Edgeworth: It's a cactus... and there's something written here on this sign... \"This cactus is a very gracious gift to Gatewater Land from the local police precinct.\" (I can't believe the police went so far as to even donate a cactus to this place.) Garage door Edgeworth: Horses are painted on this garage door to complete the Wild West theme. They almost look like they're ready to jump out into the real world and gallop away. ...Almost, being the key word. Tracks Edgeworth: Some sort of tracks were left in the mud here thanks to the rain. They look like tire tracks. Too bad they're destroying the Wild West atmosphere they worked so hard to create. (The tires on whatever made these probably got pretty muddy, as well.) After clearing all Talk options with Dick Gumshoe and Kay Faraday: ???: Laaaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, son!? Edgeworth: Mr. Amano? Ernest: Oh! Miles, my boy! I'm sorry to involve you in such an affair just after you've returned. Edgeworth: For you, Mr. Amano, I gladly offer my assistance. After all, I have you to thank for how well things turned out during my time abroad. If it wasn't [sic] for you, I might not have been introduced to that law office... ...and had the chance to study the inner workings of another country's judicial system. Ernest: No, no, no. Think nothing of it. As you know, Manfred and I go way back. I consider a beloved disciple of his to be like one of my own blood. Edgeworth: ............ Ernest: If you ever want to go overseas again, you need only to ask. I can use my company's vast network to send you anywhere at any time. Kay: So who's the old man? Edgeworth: He is the father of the currently kidnapped Lance Amano, Ernest Amano. Ernest: Now then, have you found Lance yet, Miles? Please... I miss my poor boy dearly! Edgeworth: I'm terribly sorry, but your son's whereabouts remain unknown, Mr. Amano. Ernest: Wh-- Hold on there! Then, what happened to all that money!? Edgeworth: .........I believe the $1 million has been stolen, and that the culprits are now on the run. Ernest: Whaaaaat!? Kay: Poor old man... Don't you have anything you could give him to cheer him up, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (Forgive me, Mr. Amano...) Talk Ernest Amano Talk The kidnapping Edgeworth: I was wondering if you could please tell me the details of the kidnapping one more time? Ernest: Oh. It was yesterday... A call came to the house. From the receiver came the sound of my son... \"Help me, Daddy!\"... *sniff* Edgeworth: I know this is tough, but please stay with me here, Mr. Amano... Ernest: You don't understand. He hasn't called me \"Daddy\" in ages... It was incredibly moving... I wish I had recorded him saying that. Edgeworth: (He definitely should have recorded that conversation... ...but not for the foolish sentimentalities of an old man.) Lance Amano Edgeworth: Refresh my memory, what kind of person is Lance again? Ernest: How will telling you about Lance help you get him back? Edgeworth: Surprisingly, a lot can be deduced from a person's relationships and behavior. Ernest: Very well, then. Lance is my one and only son, and he turned 21 this year. He is very much like me when I was his age -- kind and very attractive. I'm sure women simply can't keep their hands off of him. Edgeworth: Is there anything else about him you noticed of late? Ernest: Now that you mention it, I haven't been able to get in contact with our butler, Oliver. Edgeworth: Your butler...? Ernest: Yes, his name is Oliver Deacon. He's been with our family for years now. He gets along so well with Lance, so I thought maybe he would know where my son is... Oliver Deacon (appears after \"Lance Amano\") Edgeworth: Mr. Amano, could you please tell me a little more about your butler, Mr. Deacon? Ernest: As a butler, he's outstanding. He even serves as Lance's personal private tutor. He took a brief leave recently, but even after it was over, I haven't been able to reach him. Edgeworth: So you still haven't spoken with him since his leave? What about his family and friends? Ernest: They said they hadn't seen him. I've tried everything I could think of, Miles. ...Do you think this could have something to do with Lance's kidnapping? Edgeworth: It's possible, but I can't say anything for sure quite yet. (So even the person closest to the victim has gone missing... Oliver Deacon... Sounds like one name I had better keep in mind.) Present Prosecutor's Badge Ernest: Ah... Seeing that badge reminds me of Manfred. Now, HE was one fine prosecutor, the best of the best. Edgeworth: ...Yes, I can't disagree with you there. Ernest: Hmm... I sense that you don't really want to talk about him. Edgeworth: How I feel about him... It's hard for me to be truthful about that with another person. Ernest: Your hard countenance... I don't know what you're thinking or feeling... ...but mark my words, I think you are Manfred's true successor. I really do. Edgeworth: .................. Anything else Ernest: Ho, ho! That looks to be something with quite a bit of value. But then, all things have some value attached to them. Only by probing deep into the unknown can we become true winners in this world, Miles. Edgeworth: (Thanks, but knowledge isn't what's going to make me a winner here; it's information.) After clearing all Talk options with Ernest Amano: Edgeworth: .................. Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Let's begin our investigation. Even if that Interpol agent holds the authority to head this investigation... ...we can't allow ourselves to stand idly by, twiddling our thumbs. Gumshoe: I'm with you 100%, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! I, Dick Gumshoe, pledge to stick by your side through thick and thin! Edgeworth: Mr. Amano, it was my fault that the culprits escaped. Which is why, with your blessing, I vow to return Lance to you myself. Ernest: Oh! I've never seen you so passionate before, Miles. Good luck to you, my boy. Kay: Alright! Well, what are you waiting for!? Let's do some investigating! Gumshoe: If you think I'm losing to you, pal, forget it! Begin Investigation Wild, Wild West Area Gumshoe: So what should we examine first!? Edgeworth: Hmm... Thanks to Agent Lang, we can't leave this area. But the culprits were here until only very recently. Which means we may be able to find some clues that will tell us how they escaped. Gumshoe: OK! Let's get looking! Detective: Hey! You there! Gumshoe: Who, me!? Detective: What are you doing goofing off in a place like this!? Gumshoe: I wasn't goofing off! I was about to help Mr. Edgeworth kick off his investigation. Detective: You imbecile! All precinct detectives are now under Agent Lang's direct command! Gumshoe: N-No way! I am NOT working for Wolf-boy! Mr. Edgeworth! Can't you do something...!? Edgeworth: .................. I'm not exactly in a position to argue, seeing as how you ARE a member of the police. Detective: Good, now let's go! Gumshoe: Nooooooooooooooooooooooo!!! Detective: Boy, have I got just the job for someone of your talents! Kay: Well, that was exciting. Edgeworth: ............ Kay. Kay: What? Can't you tell I'm all ready to get down to some detective work!? Edgeworth: You should go home. Your parents must be worried about you. Kay: Oh, come on! I finally get to be your assistant and you try to ditch me!? Edgeworth: ...I don't recall offering you the position. Kay: Hmmmph. Why do you have to be so difficult? Besides, it's already too late, you know! Like I said, I've already stolen the position of \"assistant\" a while back! Edgeworth: Hah. You're the only one asserting that. Kay: Well! By the time anyone notices, it's already gone! That's the Yatagarasu way! Edgeworth: You shouldn't speak so lightly of things you know nothing about! Kay: Fine, whatever, you win. Go ahead and do your little investigation. But the talented assistant Kay, is going to tag along no matter what you say! Edgeworth: (Even if she turns out to be useless, she's not going to listen to me. I might as well surrender and let her come along for the ride...) Talk Blue Badger Blue Badger: .................. Kay: Hey! It's the Blue Badger! Badger GET! Edgeworth: (I really don't understand why she is so excited over this badger hunt. Speaking of Badgers, there's a person inside of there...) Mr. Badger, I wonder if you might share with me what you saw? Blue Badger: .................. Edgeworth: (He's doing that contorted wriggling \"dance\" again...) Kay: ............ Aha! ???: Aaaah! You've uncovered my undercover identity, sir! I was to remain under that head, sir! Edgeworth: ...Aren't you Officer Meekins? Meekins: SIR! Mike Meekins, reporting for duty, sir! Edgeworth: (This man was a witness in one of the cases I headed two years ago. About the only thing I remember about this officer is that... ...he often spoke and acted before he thought, which gave me a great deal of headaches.) Kay: Is he a friend of yours, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: I've met him in the courtroom once before. (Hmm... Why was he so upset when we unmasked him? Does he have something to hide?) Mike Meekins (after talking to Blue Badger) Talk Mike Meekins Edgeworth: Officer Meekins, why are you standing here wasting time? Meekins: SIR! Because I'm not a police officer right now, sir! I'm the Blue Badger! And I'm creating memories and dreams for the kids! That's never a waste of time, sir! I have a dream to become as big as Detective Gumshoe, sir! I was patrolling the scorchingly boring beat until a little while ago... ...when the dispatch radio on my shoulder crackled that the kidnappers had escaped, sir! I thought maybe this was my shot at making Detective, sir! I rushed on over to join in, but when I got here, there was a sea of people already... ...and I couldn't spread my trademark friendliness and joy on to anyone... Edgeworth: (It would seem that some people never change...) The Blue Badger Edgeworth: So why exactly are you in that ridiculous outfit? Meekins: Sir! That's because, sir! I'm here to keep the visitors in good spirits, sir! But it's also to hide the fact that I'm an officer on the trail of a kidnapper, sir! Edgeworth: I see. Agent Lang is very wise to employ this sort of diversionary tactics. Meekins: To be handed the role of THE Blue Badger out of all the different disguises, sir... It's... It's such an honor! Any clues? (appears after \"The Blue Badger\") Edgeworth: How long have you been standing here, Officer? Meekins: SIR! For about one little hour, sir! Edgeworth: (Hmm... That's around the time I woke up from being knocked unconscious...) Meekins: And I've been here even since, sir! Edgeworth: (If that's true, then it's possible Officer Meekins saw the kidnappers escaping!) Meekins: B-B-B-However, sir! I must tell you I didn't see a thiiiiiiing, sir!!! Edgeworth: I haven't asked you anything yet, Officer. Meekins: No no no no no! B-But I know you will, sir! Edgeworth: (He's hiding something from me.) Officer Meekins, I insist that you tell me more about your recent movements! Meekins: Sir! I've been playing the Blue Badger this whole time, sir! And getting into it, too! I patrolled the park, all while wearing this costume! And about one hour ago, I came over here, sir! I haven't seen any suspicious-looking people this whole time, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: What you said just now is contradictory to the facts. Kay: How so, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: This is what Officer Meekins's testimony contradicts! Present Badger Photo Rally Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Officer Meekins, let's back things up. I'd like to ask you about your last statement.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your testimony contradicts this piece of evidence! Meekins: I'm just a little patrolman, so I don't understand what you're talking about, sir! Kay: I can't say I get it, either. Edgeworth: (Gnnnrk! This isn't what I was looking for!) I'm sorry, Officer, but could you please repeat what you said one more time? Meekins: Of course, sir! I'd be honored to repeat myself as many times as needed, sir! For almost a whole little hour, I didn't see any suspicious-looking people around, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: As I thought, what you said just now is contradictory to the facts. Kay: OK, so what exactly is so contradictory, Mr. Edgeworth? Leads back to: \"This is what Officer Meekins's testimony contradicts!\" Edgeworth: Officer Meekins, let's back things up. I'd like to ask you about your last statement. Meekins: Sir! Of course, sir! If that's your wish, Mr. Prosecutor! This little patrolman will wait as long as I am commanded to wait! Edgeworth: You said that you saw a Blue Badger, correct? And yet, if you take a look at this, what you saw was not supposed to happen. This park is supposed to have only one of each Badger in it at any given time. Which means that as long as you are the Blue Badger, Officer Meekins... ...you should not have seen another Blue Badger wandering the premises! Meekins: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!? SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!? Kay: Then, that would mean that there are two Blue Badgers (A 2nd Blue Badger - There's only supposed to be 1 Blue Badger in the park, but a second was spotted.) walking around! But why!? Any clues? (subsequent times) Edgeworth: How long have you been standing here, Officer? Meekins: SIR! For about one little hour, sir! Edgeworth: (Hmm... That's around the time I woke up from being knocked unconscious...) Meekins: And I've been here even since, sir! Edgeworth: (If that's true, then it's possible Officer Meekins saw the kidnappers escaping!) Meekins: Yup, I've been hanging around in this area ever since then, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: And yet, if you take a look at this, what you saw was not supposed to happen. This park is supposed to have only one of each Badger in it at any given time. Which means that as long as you are the Blue Badger, Officer Meekins... ...you should not have seen another Blue Badger wandering the premises! Meekins: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!? SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!? Kay: But then, that would mean that there are two Blue Badgers walking around the park! Present Prosecutor's Badge Meekins: Sir! It's so incredibly shiny, but it has a really ugly shape! I knew it! I was right to go for the much more manly police badge, sir! But I lose it alot [sic], and I just know I'm going to lose it for real one of these days, sir! Kay: ...Mr. Edgeworth, I think this cop is one donut short of a baker's dozen. Edgeworth: I know. Believe me, I know. Blue Badger Bible Meekins: Sir! You have a copy of the Blue Badger Bible, too, sir!? That was written by experts on the Badger family, sir! And it's very, very thorough! It doesn't matter that I was made the Blue Badger only a little while ago, sir! That book helped me memorize every name of every Badger, sir! Edgeworth: (It's not that hard to remember four incredibly obvious names...) Badger Photo Rally Meekins: Drip, drop, little by little our privacy is being sold off to the public through this, sir! But that means I need to work extra hard on my cute poses! Kay: Ooh, like what? Meekins: Like thiiiiiiiiiiis! Kay: Great! Now I know what your new pose will beeeeeeeeeee! Look, sir! I've successfully stolen his pose and speaking styyyyyyyyyyyyyle, sir! Edgeworth: *sigh* That's nice, Kay. Anything else Meekins: Sir! I'm undercover as the Blue Badger now, sir! I must pretend to not know anything about anything, sir! Edgeworth: (I mustn't respond to that. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel...) Ernest Amano Present Stolen Costumes Ernest: Just what sort of operation is this, that they would allow their valuables to be stolen!? It's a disgrace to the way businesses are run everywhere! Edgeworth: Well, thieves, by nature. generally tend to target these types. Ernest: Stealing is an abominable behavior, don't you agree, little miss!? Kay: ...Y-Yeah, the worst! Edgeworth: (Am I going to have to add \"hypocrite\" to the list of things you are, missy?) Examine Barrels on left side Kay: Hah! I've got you now, you vile criminals! Edgeworth: ...I'd think the kidnappers would have better sense than to try hiding in these. Kay: Oh, come on! Lighten up, will ya? I was only joking! I don't REALLY think that the criminals would be hiding here, right in front of two officers! Edgeworth: ...I-I certainly hope not. Footprints Kay: Hey! There's a bunch of footprints in the mud over here! Edgeworth: I remember hearing rain fall out here while I was being held in there. Kay: Yup, it was just a passing rain. That's why the ground has already pretty much dried up. Edgeworth: I should be thankful. It left us with some nice footprint samples. Kay: You know what? I bet if we followed them, we can find out where the kidnappers went! Plus, we'd be able to spot them because of their muddy shoes! Edgeworth: ...I don't think it will be that easy. Kay: Why not? Edgeworth: Look carefully. There are quite a few different sets here. And we don't know which ones belong to the kidnappers. Kay: Oh, that's true... We don't know what kind of shoes (What kind of shoes? - If only we knew, we'd be able to track the kidnappers from the footprints.) they were wearing. Horizontal bar Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth, isn't this one of those things you tie horses to? Edgeworth: Yes, although the horses are in another location at the moment. Kay: Aww... And here I was hoping I would get to ride one. Edgeworth: You know how to ride a horse? Kay: Nope! Never rode one in my life! But I have an Asian friend who was born in the year of the horse! Edgeworth: (\"Non sequitur\" is the only way to describe your logic...) Barrels by cactus Kay: If these were real, I wonder what you'd put in them. Edgeworth: Water would be the obvious answer... Kay: But if you stored water in a barrel under the blazing hot sun, wouldn't it go bad? Edgeworth: People of that period probably didn't care about how it tasted. Kay: Sorry, but I can't let you get away with making fun of our forefathers! I mean, maybe they really liked the strange taste! Edgeworth: ...Look who's making fun of them now. Cactus Kay: Look! There's a blurb about the cactus here! \"This cactus is a very gracious gift to Gatewater Land from the local police precinct.\" Edgeworth: (I can't believe the police went so far as to even donate a cactus to this place.) Kay: So, is the police department running a cactus farm on the side? Ha ha, just kidding! They wouldn't do something so silly! Edgeworth: (Actually, I have the vague impression I've seen a cactus farm at the precinct before.) Garage door Edgeworth: Horses are painted on this garage door to complete the Wild West theme. Kay: They look so life-like, don't you think!? Edgeworth: Are you thinking of wrangling, or rather, stealing them? Kay: If you can coax them out of there, sure! Come on, I know you can sweet-talk them out! Edgeworth: I could be holding a cube of sugar in my hand and they wouldn't budge, Kay. Tracks Edgeworth: It's a set of tire tracks originating from the garage. Kay: Aha! So that means a car left from the garage at some time, right? Edgeworth: Correct. But for the car to leave these tracks... ...it would mean that it left during the passing rain. (That's the only explanation as to why these tracks are made of mud.) Hmm, three treads... I think we can also safely assume it's a special type of car. Logic Connect \"Costumes\" and \"A 2nd Blue Badger\" Edgeworth: A second Blue Badger that shouldn't exist... Clearly, the true identity of the person underneath is... Kay: Oh, I know! It's one of the kidnappers, right!? The person wore a costume to get away (Costumed escape - The identity of the second Blue Badger was probably the kidnapper in disguise.)! Edgeworth: Precisely. After all, the costumes that went missing from the storage area are... Kay: ...A Blue Badger, a Proto Badger, and a Bad Badger. Edgeworth: Yes, those three. Kay: So there are three phony Badgers running around in the park somewhere, huh! Stolen Costumes data jotted down in my Organizer. Connect \"What kind of shoes?\" and \"Costumed escape\" Leads to: \"Now that we know that the kidnappers were wearing Badger costumes...\" Partner Kay: Yes? Talk The kidnapping Edgeworth: Kay, what do you think about the kidnapping? Kay: Well, I don't know anything about the victim... ...so actually, I was hoping you could tell me. Edgeworth: Ah, that's right. I never did explain the situation to you. I got involved because of a phone call I received. It was from none other than the director of the Amano Group, Mr. Ernest Amano. His only son, Lance, had been kidnapped, and he wanted me to be the drop-off man. Little did I suspect that I would be abducted myself. Kay: And that's when I found you tied to a pole screaming, \"Nnnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!!\" Edgeworth: Can you please drop that already!? Present Prosecutor's Badge Kay: If I had one of these, I could be a prosecutor, too, right? Edgeworth: Don't even think of stealing this from me. Kay: If it's that important to you, then why don't you wear it on your lapel? Edgeworth: (I suppose I can't really tell her... ...that no one in the Prosecutor's Office wears their badges. But why does everyone ask that question of me? That's what I'D like to know.) Stolen Costumes Kay: Looks like there's another thief afoot! Edgeworth: Only if we assume that this is not your handiwork. Kay: Are you kidding!? You know that the Blue Badger is enemy number one to me! Can you imagine me ever being on good terms with that thing!? Edgeworth: .................. Actually, it's surprisingly easy. Edgeworth: Now that we know that the kidnappers were wearing Badger costumes... ...those footprints from earlier take on a new, and very significant meaning. Kay: Oh, you mean now we know which tracks belong to the kidnappers, right!? Edgeworth: Yes. More than shoe prints, we need to follow the paw prints of Badgers. Kay: OK, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to use those footprints and go Badger hunting! Examine Footprints Leads to: \"Hmm... So we're looking for footprints made by a costume...\" Kay: Hmm... So we're looking for footprints made by a costume... Hey! I think I found them! There are two sets here! Edgeworth: They both do look like possible candidates. Kay: This set is walking off to the west... Argh! It just stops! I can't make heads or tails of where it's headed from here! Edgeworth: I think we can assume it's headed towards the stadium... Kay: Hmm... I wonder where the other set leads? This one seems to be headed east... Huh? Quick, Mr. Edgeworth! I've got him! I got one of the culprits! Meekins: Aaaah! Nooooo! I'm not a kidnapper, sir!!! Edgeworth: Down, Kay. Clearly, those footprints belong to Officer Meekins. But our criminals were each wearing a costume. Kay: Aha! Maybe they came over to this garage for something? Edgeworth: That's what I would suppose. Officer Meekins, if you could step aside for a moment. We need to examine the garage. Meekins: SIR! Roger Wilco, sir! Examine Garage door Leads to: \"Let's open this shutter and see what we find.\" Footprints Edgeworth: There are two sets of prints that could be from the kidnappers... Kay: One set is headed off to the west... Edgeworth: To the stadium, I would suppose... Kay: And the other set heads to the east... Edgeworth: We should follow these prints to their conclusion and investigate the garage. Kay: OK! Edgeworth: Let's open this shutter and see what we find. Kay: Maybe we'll find the kidnappers hiding inside! Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Edgeworth: Wh-What in the--!? (We seem to have stumbled across a dead body...) Kay: ............ Edgeworth: (She must be in severe shock to have been the first to find it... Now then, who is this man?) Ernest: I-It's Oliver! Edgeworth: ! Mr. Amano, are you saying that this man is... Ernest: Yes... He's my butler... How could something like this have happened!? Edgeworth: (Indeed. And why was Mr. Deacon here to begin with? I'd better investigate this crime scene quickly, before Agent Lang or his men return. The kidnapper's footprints lead right to this garage... ...and right to a dead body. Is it possible one of the kidnappers is now a murder victim (Victim was kidnapper? - Following a kidnapper's prints led us to a body. Was the victim in a costume?)...?) From my cursory examination, I believe this man died of a fatal bullet wound. Preliminary Findings data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: You sure are calm for someone who just found a body. Edgeworth: (It's surprising what one can become accustomed to in the span of two days...) Leads to examination of body Talk Ernest Amano Edgeworth: Mr. Amano... This body... Ernest: Yes... That's my butler, Oliver... How could something like this have happened!? Edgeworth: (Indeed. And why was Mr. Deacon here to begin with?) Examine Footprints Edgeworth: There are two sets of prints that could be from the kidnappers... Kay: One set is headed off to the west... Edgeworth: To the stadium, I would suppose... Kay: And the other set heads to the east... Edgeworth: ...Right to the garage. (Do these prints belong to the victim we found inside the garage?) Rocking chair Kay: Ooh, did you know? I really love this kind of chair, the way it rocks back and forth! When I grow old, I plan to sit in one of these and rock the day away every day! But you don't have to wait, Mr. Edgeworth! You're at just the right age for one! Edgeworth: (Do I really project myself as someone of that age?) Blue Badgermobile Edgeworth: What a peculiar car... Kay: Yeah. From the look of it, it must be the Blue Badgermobile. And it has three tires... So maybe it left those tire tracks behind!? Edgeworth: *sigh* That's simply not possible. Kay: Huh? Why? Edgeworth: Take a look at the tires. There's no mud stuck to them. Therefore, it must have been here since before it started to rain. Kay: Oh, gotcha! Good eye! Edgeworth: (It's a shame I don't see any other clues around...) Body Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Examine Pendant Edgeworth: (This is an unusually-shaped pendant...) Kay: What is it? Is it something valuable? Edgeworth: (She seems to have regained some of her composure...) Kay: It looks like a horse pendant! It's got an antique feel about it, and it's really pretty... Hold on... This is made of platinum silver! Nice! It IS worth something after all! Ooh, and look! There's something written on the back. \"Colin Devorae\"... It's a name. Edgeworth: \"Colin Devorae\"...? (But this man's name is...) Wounds Edgeworth: (As long as that Interpol agent has control of this case... ...I'm not going to be able to have a real autopsy done on the victim. I'm no doctor, but let's see what I can piece together myself.) Hmm, there are two gunshot wounds one in his abdomen and one in his shoulder. Kay: So that means he was shot twice...? Edgeworth: No, I don't think so. I think the abdominal one is an entry wound, and the one near his shoulder is the exit wound. Kay: Nice! I knew you could figure it out! Edgeworth: It comes with experience, and I've seen my share of crime scenes. (Speaking of experience... ...this crime scene seems a bit too clean for a murder where the bullet went clean through. I should make a note of this oddity.) Preliminary Findings data updated in my Organizer. Wounds (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Hmm, there are two gunshot wounds one in his abdomen and one in his shoulder. Kay: So that means he was shot twice...? Edgeworth: No, I don't think so. I think the abdominal one is an entry wound, and the one near his shoulder is the exit wound. Kay: Nice! I knew you could figure it out! Edgeworth: It comes with experience, and I've seen my share of crime scenes. (Speaking of experience... ...this crime scene seems a bit too clean for a murder where the bullet went clean through. I should make a note of this oddity.) Deduce pendant (after examining pendant) Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Preliminary Findings Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's something not right about the name on the pendant. The victim is the Amano family butler, and his name is \"Oliver Deacon\". But the name on the pendant is \"Colin Devorae\". Kay: I wonder what's up with that? Edgeworth: I don't know, but... ...I think we've hit upon an important piece of information. Mr. Deacon's Pendant data jotted down in my Organizer. Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence alone solves this whole case! Kay: Really!? You think so!? Because to be honest, I don't really see how it solves anything... You must be confused jumping from a kidnapping to a murder. Yeah, that's it! Edgeworth: (Nngh! I can't believe I made such a large blunder... ...that even this little girl could point it out!) Leads back to examination of body Examine evidence Mr. Deacon's Pendant Front side Edgeworth: It's the victim's pendant, which is shaped like a horse. Kay: It's got a real dignified look on its face. That makes it worth all the more... ! Oh no, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What? Did you find an important piece of evidence? Kay: This... is made of platinum silver! That makes this thing super-valuable! I've seen this type of jewelry at a lot of stores before, so I know it when I see it! Edgeworth: ............Kay, if you ever laid so much as a finger on those pieces of jewelry... Kay: Wh-What? Me? I-I'd never do something like that! Edgeworth: (......Is it possible that she has never wanted to steal from a jewelry store before?) Name on back Edgeworth: The name \"Colin Devorae\" is engraved here. Kay: I really admire people who carve their own names into a pendant. Edgeworth: Oh? And why would that be? Kay: You have no imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. Did you ever think that maybe people want to have their loved ones always nearby? Edgeworth: It's not as if I have a wedding band, and I have no interest in accessorizing. Kay: *sigh* I suppose. Anyway, you know what? More than wearing flashy accessories... ...I'd rather be engraving my name into every treasure I can find all around the world! Edgeworth: (A sign of affection is one thing, but blatant vandalizing is just a bit different.) Partner Talk The murder Edgeworth: It appears that this case has taken a turn for the unexpected. Kay: I'll say! I was shocked to open that shutter and find a dead body inside! Edgeworth: I suppose most people would be, since the average person rarely runs across a corpse. Kay: Wait! You just compared me to a \"normal person\", didn't you!? I'll have you know that I'm... Edgeworth: Sorry. I suppose I should have recognized that you're a... thief, correct? Kay: No! I'm a GREAT Thief! And a GREAT Thief is not surprised by anything! Got it!? Edgeworth: (Apparently, with GREAT thievery comes GREAT loss of short-term memory.) Present Mr. Deacon's Pendant Kay: This horse is really pretty... Edgeworth: Don't even think about it. Kay: OK, I'll just hold onto it then! Don't worry, it's safe with me! Edgeworth: (Just so we're clear, Kay, a five-finger discount is not part of the bargain.) After examining wounds and correctly deducing pendant: Investigation Complete ???: Laaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, sweetie!? Edgeworth: Excuse me, but you are...? ???: *ba-dump* Edgeworth: ? ???: Oh, this is bad... He's really good looking! Ack! Stop it, Lauren! You can't let yourself fall for a playboy like him! You're in love with... Kay: Sounds like someone doesn't know the meaning of the phrase \"inner monologue\", huh? Edgeworth: Sorry to interrupt your... conversation, but might you be a friend of Lance? ???: Yes, I'm Lance's girlfriend... My name is Lauren Paups. Edgeworth: His girlfriend...? Paups: Oh, it's not like that! We're more like friends... and, um... We're not lovers or anything! We! Well, we haven't gotten that far yet! But... I guess that's how people are going to see it, so I should just accept it... I even got this ring as a present from Lance... *swoon* Kay: Ha ha, you know what she reminds of? A cartoon character! Edgeworth: N...Nnnnrrrghn... May I inquire as to why you are here? Paups: I haven't been able to get in contact with Lance lately... ...and I began to get really worried. *sob* I looked everywhere for him, and then I heard about the kidnapping, so I came here. Kay: Wow, you're really strong for having made it through all this by yourself! Paups: Um! Is it true!? Has Lance really been kidnapped!? Edgeworth: ...No one is supposed to know, but yes, it's true. Paups: Oh, Lance...! I can't believe you've been spirited away... I wonder how you're doing right now... Kay: Looks like she's gone back to the \"fair maiden in love\" routine... So, Mr. Edgeworth, where do we go from here? Edgeworth: Well, we found a body, so we should look into the murder... ???: Lang: My men brought me up to speed over the radio. And I have to say, you really should've called. I heard you found something very intriguing. Edgeworth: I have nothing to hide, Agent Lang. It's exactly what you see before you. Lang: I'll take it from here. Yeah, that guy's really dead. Hey! You waiting for an invitation? Hurry up and detain the suspect, now. Edgeworth: (Suspect? Who...?) Lang: Officer Meekins, is it? You're coming with us. Meekins: What!? SIR! I had nothing to do with it, sir! Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Don't you think you're being a bit rash!? Do you even have a good reason to suspect Officer Meekins!? Lang: Hah, I leave that kind of stuff to you prosecutors. It's your job, after all. Like I said earlier, the crime scene isn't as forgiving as your precious courtroom. Edgeworth: That's your answer!? Lang: I know you like your logic and reasoning... ...but that sort of impractical fluff is not needed out here in the field. Edgeworth: ! Lang: All you have to do is arrest suspicious person after suspicious person. That's how you eliminate crime from the streets! Edgeworth: But that's also precisely how you unnecessarily arrest innocent people by mistake! Lang: \"Innocent people\"? Nonsense! There's no such thing as an innocent person. We've all got a blemish or two in our hearts. Edgeworth: That's tyranny! I won't allow such a thing to go on unchecked before my eyes! Lang: Heh! Too bad you don't call the shots around here! Edgeworth: As I have sworn to uphold the laws of this land, I cannot allow you to take this man in. That you would arrest a man on false charges without even conducting an investigation... ...have you no honor as a member of law enforcement!? MIB: You! How dare you speak so disrespectfully to our Shifu!? Lang: Hold it! .................. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You amuse me, Mr. Prosecutor. Lang Zi says: \"Every pack has its own rules.\" If you can play by their rules and come out on top, that is a true victory. Alright, I'll give your beloved laws a fair shake. I'll show you just how much investigating I've done... ...through my line of logic! Argument -- Shi-Long Lang's Logic -- Lang: I've seen a lot of bodies like the one being carted off in my time. I can say he was shot in a single glance, but even you figured that much out, right? With your current gun laws, it's not exactly easy to get your hands on a gun. Not unless you're a member of law enforcement like Officer Meekins, isn't that right? Edgeworth: That is your reasoning...? Lang: Solid as a rock! It's based on the philosophy of detainment! Kay: Um... What's this \"philosophy of detainment\"? Lang: Hah! You don't know!? In that case, pay attention, girlie. In my country, the criminals have a saying: \"Beware of the wolf.\" Edgeworth: Why the wolf...? Lang: Because in my language, \"lang\" means \"wolf\", and you don't mess with me or my pack. And as for the detainment philosophy, its father is my honorable ancestor, Lang Zi. Edgeworth: (Hmm... You'd think I'd have heard of him and his teachings if he is [sic] that famous...) Lang: Lang Zi developed it as he worked to lock criminals away thousands of years ago. To this day, the Zheng Fa police still trains its recruits using his philosophies. Kay: But \"thousands of years ago\"? That makes your story about as believable as a fairy tale! Edgeworth: Hmph. Anything wears down and breaks over time. Do you really believe something as ancient as that can be applied to today's world? Lang: ......You want to put it to a test? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So what can you tell me about the body? Lang: A lot. Even without an autopsy, I have my eyes. They teach you the basics of forensics along with the detention philosophy. Edgeworth: Oh? Then you wouldn't mind telling me a little of what you've figured out, correct? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Yes, I think anyone who saw the bullet wounds would come to the same conclusion. Lang: Lang: Heh, don't pat yourself on the back yet! Edgeworth: What's that supposed to mean? Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Search where the water is deepest.\" You have to keep your eyes on the big fish that lurks in the depths, which is the killer. Edgeworth: Is that right? And what would you know about the killer? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It would appear you've studied a little of our laws. Lang: Studied? Who needs to study what every child on any street corner already knows? It's that... that......... Shih-na! Shih-na: The \"Federal Firearms Restriction Act\". Lang: That's it. The Federal Firearms Restriction Act. I hear it's not easy to get a gun these days. Edgeworth: (Interesting. That woman is the one in charge of keeping track of the information.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If that's the case, there are plenty of other officers who might be potential suspects. You're not seriously going to arrest each and every one of them, are you? Lang: As if I would need to! I've already looked into everyone else here. Edgeworth: Oh? Lang: Other than Officer Meekins. I know no one else's weapon has been fired. Edgeworth: ! H-How did you check every single person's weapon in such a short span of time!? Lang: That's because each and every one of my subordinates is extremely capable. It didn't take more than a few minutes to conduct the entire investigation! Edgeworth: (The power of sheer numbers...) But you have yet to check Officer Meekins's weapon, correct? Lang: Thanks for reminding me. Hey, you! Show me your gun. Meekins: ..................Oh! Edgeworth: (What's wrong...? Why does he look so sickly pale all of a sudden?) Meekins: ............Gun! Lang: What did you say? I can't hear you. Stop mumbling and spit it out already! Meekins: Sir, sir... I LOST MY GUN, SIIIIIIIIIIR!!! Edgeworth: How could you be so irresponsible!? Lang: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! In the end, it looks like you're still the only suspect we've got. You're the one who waited here outside this garage to ambush and kill the victim! Edgeworth: (So you think that Officer Meekins waited here to kill the victim, do you, Lang? I think this little accusation deserves a lot more scrutiny.) Add statement \"Officer Meekins ambushed the victim in this garage and killed him here with his gun!\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you are implying that the murder weapon in this case is a policeman's service revolver? Lang: I don't know for sure just yet, but it's entirely possible. After all, Officer Meekins did just admit that he \"lost his gun\". Ha ha ha ha! You'd think he could come up with a better lie than that! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean to tell me that the murder occurred here, in this garage? Lang: From the fact that the suspect was found almost next to where the body was found... ...I'd say that it's pretty obvious that this is the crime scene. Lang Zi says: \"A criminal always returns to the scene of the crime.\" Kay: Hey! Finally, a quote even I've heard of before! Lang: Furthermore, Lang Zi says: \"Successful investigations are the result of multiple returns to a crime scene.\" Edgeworth: (Looks like neither detectives nor criminals have changed their ways over the millenniums.) Edgeworth: (So this is the kind of conclusion the philosophy of detainment can lead you to...) Kay: I don't get it, Mr. Edgeworth. Why are you putting yourself on the line for Mr. Meekins? Edgeworth: It's not that I particularly care about what happens to Officer Meekins. Kay: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: However, I can't simply stand by while Agent Lang ignores our country's laws.

    "cot": "Evidence 9 (Victim's Costume) indicates that the victim was wearing a costume and was likely shot from point-blank range with gunpowder burn evidence. It also notes that there is a lack of blood at the crime scene and that the costume fully masks the wearer. This suggests careful planning or that the victim was involved in something more complex.\n\nTestimony 4 (Lang's statement: \"Officer Meekins ambushed the victim in this garage and killed him here with his gun!\") bluntly accuses Officer Meekins of committing the murder at the scene with his gun.\n\nThe contradiction arises because Evidence 9 suggests the victim was wearing a costume that masks the identity and that was likely involved in the shooting (gunpowder burn on costume), while Lang directly accuses Officer Meekins of the killing without considering the evidence of the costume and its implications. Moreover, the evidence suggests the body was moved due to the lack of blood at the scene, contradicting a simple ambush theory as proposed by Lang.\n\nThus, the evidence on the costume (Evidence 9) contradicts Lang's testimony accusing Meekins of a straightforward ambush with his gun (Testimony 4).\n",

Edgeworth: (...It's time.) Gumshoe: Don't worry, Mr. Edgeworth! I'll be following your every movement with my binoculars! Edgeworth: Good to hear. Now make sure you don't lose sight of me. I'm counting on you for backup. Gumshoe: You can count on me, sir! Edgeworth: I have to go. The kidnapper is supposed to contact me soon. (Who would've thought that upon my return, I'd be thrust into a kidnapping case. And that I would be the one who would have to make the ransom drop-off...) Edgeworth: (Let's see... I checked that the money is all there, safe inside this suitcase... Now all I have to do is await further instructions from the kidnapper... ...which I'm expecting to be transferred to my cell phone. I wonder who else is around? This is the meeting place, after all...) ???: Welcome to Gatewater Land! Edgeworth: Hm? Oh, thank you. ???: And a big hello to you! I'm the Proto Badger! Nice to meet you! ............ Edgeworth: ............ Proto B.: Excuse me, but were you perhaps thinking of taking a picture of me? Edgeworth: A picture...? Of you...? Sorry, but I'm not interested. Proto B.: Aww, that's too bad. Well, have a good day! Edgeworth: ...Hello? ???: ...Who aRE yOu? YoU'Re nOt ERNesT AmaNo! Edgeworth: (It sounds like the kidnapper is using some sort of voice alteration device...) I'm his representative, Miles Edgeworth. ???: ...ARE YoU a cOP? Edgeworth: No, I'm......... a prosecutor. ???: ............ Edgeworth: ............ I know what you're wondering, and yes, I have brought the ransom money with me. ???: I SeE... In THAt caSe, bRIng thE mOnEy wiTh You to tHe StaDIum. Edgeworth: (So this person intends to see if I'm being followed, huh. Please, Detective Gumshoe... I really need you to come through for me this one time.) Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth speaking. ???: NeXT, ComE to THe HaUNteD HOUsE.

Edgeworth: (Am I being watched from somewhere?) ???: LeAVe tHe MoNEy aND GO. NoW. Edgeworth: Nnngh............ .................. (I was hoping for an exchange, but maybe I should do as they say for now and not push it.) Edgeworth: (I couldn't catch even a glimpse of the kidnapper. Perhaps I should keep an eye on this haunted house until police backup arrives.) Edgeworth: (Agh! It was a trap!) March 13, 11:23 AM ???????????? Examine evidence Prosecutor's Badge Front of badge Edgeworth: This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so. Back of badge Edgeworth: Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else! ???: That guy... betrayed... ???: No... can't be... Then the deal... Edgeworth: (Who is that...? And what are they talking about...?) ???: ...split... police... ???: ...Alright... ???: ...in front of... meet up... Edgeworth: (...I can't move my body... ...I-I fear I may faint again...) Edgeworth: Where am I...? (How long was I out...? It wasn't raining like it is now when I made the drop-off... This was supposed to be a simple affair... ...so why have I been taken hostage as well!? I can only assume Detective Gumshoe lost sight of me at some point.) Edgeworth: The only reason I agreed to be the drop-off man was because of that phone call. It was from Mr. Ernest Amano, the director of the powerful zaibatsu, the Amano Group. But aside from that, I also owe him a great debt of gratitude. His only son, Lance, had been kidnapped. I know that Lance is already in his twenties, but I guess some things you never grow out of. Edgeworth: .................. (I can't sit around waiting for someone to come help me! I must escape somehow...) ...Nnnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!! ???: Hahaha! Was that you making that funny sound!? Edgeworth: ............Who's there!? And how dare you laugh at a gentleman's plight!? ...Who are you? Are you one of the kidnappers? ???: A kidnapper? Me? No way! I'm not into such petty crimes. Nope! I'm after something much, much bigger! Edgeworth: .................. (Argh! I must be worn out from today's ordeal. Focus, Miles!) ???: Oh, I forgot to introduce myself! Sorry about that! Ahem! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: Great Thief? (And did she really just claim to be the Yatagarasu?) Kay: Oh, but my real name is Kay Faraday. You can call me \"Kay\", 'kay!? Good! Glad that's settled! Edgeworth: .................. Not quite. I have a mountain of questions for you... ...but first, if you would be so kind as to remove these ropes. Kay: Hmm... I wonder... Should I remove them? I was actually having a lot of fun watching you make those silly faces... Edgeworth: .................. Kay: Hey! There's no need to get all mad and icy glare-y on me, you know! This rope goes through here, and... there you go! Edgeworth: What a relief. I owe you my thanks. Kay: Ah, it's OK. You can pay me back in full later! Edgeworth: (Now then... What question should I start with? Unfortunately, I can already tell nothing is going to be easy with this cheeky girl...) Talk Great Thief Edgeworth: You call yourself a Great Thief, yet are you really a thief at all? Kay: You doubt me? I get it! You think that a young lady like me couldn't possibly be such a big-time thief, right? Edgeworth: (That's... not the part I have a tough time believing...) Kay: I am the real, genuine Yatagarasu, you know. Yup! I'm a pure-blooded Great Thief! It's a little something I inherited from my predecessor. Edgeworth: In that case... you wouldn't mind if I arrested you then, right? Kay: What!? Of course I'd mind! I haven't stolen anything yet! Seriously, I don't know how you can (changed from [can you] in the original release, correcting the typo) say such a horrible thing to your savior! Edgeworth: (That's true. Technically, she hasn't stolen anything in front of me... yet.) Yatagarasu (appears after \"Great Thief\") Edgeworth: When you say you're the \"Yatagarasu\", do you mean you are THE Yatagarasu...? Kay: Yup! The most righteous of the righteous! The legendary Great Thief! But I inherited the title only recently (changed from [the title was only recently succeeded to me] in the original release)... ...so I haven't had a chance to steal anything yet as the second Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: (I was not aware that thieves could pass down their titles like that...) Kay: But don't worry! I've got some big plans in the works! Edgeworth: Big plans, huh? They wouldn't happen to lead to a big arrest, would they? Kay: I knew it! There's just no reasoning with a prosecutor. Edgeworth: I'm not the problem here! Kay: I'll have you know that the Yatagarasu has no interest in stealing petty trinkets! There's one thing and only one thing I want to steal! Edgeworth: (Only one thing? And what would that be?) Kay: But that's going to have to wait until we find our way out of here! Edgeworth: Well, at least there is one thing we agree on. I'm sure I'll have plenty of time later to learn more about you. Present Anything Kay: Don't surprise me like that! I can't believe you're just shoving things in my face! I mean, aren't there more pressing things you'd rather ask little ol' me? Edgeworth: (She has a point... I should probably find out more about my mysterious savior first.) After clearing \"Yatagarasu\" Talk option: Kay: So, you never told me what your name is, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: Ah, I guess not. I'm Miles Edgeworth. Kay: Aha! Now I remember! Edgeworth: (...How can you \"remember\" something I just told you...? But she sure is cheery.) Kay: Alright, then Mr. Edgeworth, let's get outta here! ............Hm? Edgeworth: ...It would seem that we are locked in from the other side. Kay: What!? No way! I don't hear you! La la la! Edgeworth: Kay, you do remember where you came in from, right...? It looks like that might be our only way out of this room... Kay: Whoops, slight miscalculation. That's a good height to make an entrance from, but I can't jump that high to make an exit! Edgeworth: ...*sigh* I suppose we have no choice but to look around and see if we can't find another way out. Begin Investigation Isolation Room Talk Kay Faraday Present anything Kay: Hey! Don't you think getting out of here is more important right now!? You can ask me about that later! Edgeworth: (I suppose she's right...) Examine Cell phone Leads to: \"Hm? Isn't this my phone?\" Lockers Kay: Man! Why did they have to put the windows so high up, anyway!? How is a thief supposed to make her daring escape!? Edgeworth: I suppose we could make our way out if we were able to climb on top of these lockers. Kay: Haha! That's pretty clever! You'd make a good thief yet, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Please don't ever place my name and the word \"thief\" in the same sentence again. Kay: Let's see... I wonder if I can jump and grab the top of the locker here... Man! Why did they have to make such ginormous lockers, anyway!? Edgeworth: (Even if we wanted to use these lockers, we'd need some sort of foothold (Lockers - If we can get to the top, then we can escape. If only there were some footholds...)...) Boxes Kay: Hey! There's something inside the bottom-right box. Oh, I think it's a Pink Badger costume! Edgeworth: Pink Badger...? Kay: You don't keep up with what's going on in the world, do you? In that case, you'd better study up on the whole Badger clan with this! Edgeworth: What is this thing? Kay: Think of it as a bible of all the things you'll ever need to know about the clan! Edgeworth: (...Whatever. I suppose I can keep it as a reference guide or something.) Blue Badger Bible data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: I suppose this means that this is where they keep all the costumes? Kay: It certainly looks that way! It's like the Badger family's home! Edgeworth: (There are eight boxes, but seven of them are empty. Which means that seven of the costumes (Costumes - It seems that the costumes of the Badger family are kept in the Isolation Room.) are in use right now.) But aren't these Badgers the mascots of the police force? Kay: Well, I heard that the police had a hand in sponsoring this theme park. Probably because the Gatewater Group owes the police from all those cases they solved. Edgeworth: They have all the power of the state, and they used it to make a theme park!? Kay: It's not just any theme park! They have a handcuff-shaped, double-looping roller coaster... Edgeworth: That's quite enough. I'm feeling woozy from just the thought of such a thing. (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Key Edgeworth: And what have we here...? Kay: Ah! .................. Edgeworth: (Why do I feel a laser-like stare aimed right at me?) D-Did you want to take a look? Kay: Well, don't mind if I do! Ooh! I see! Yes, this is definitely...! A key (Tiny key - I may be able to open something, somewhere in this room with this key.)! I'm sure it's a key to something! Edgeworth: The \"something\" is what is relevant to my interest... Blue Badger boxes Kay: Look! It's the Blue Badger! Edgeworth: (I suppose even this thing can be popular with women.) Kay: My nemesis (changed from [I can't stand him] in the original release)! Edgeworth: Wh-What in the...!? (Why is she beating it (changed from [suddenly beating the Blue Badger's image] in the original release) up!?) Kay: He's got the word \"badge\" right in his name! That [sic] nothing but bad news for someone like me! (changed from [How bad is that for a girl like me!?] in the original release) And to think he's out there wandering around in this park... I'd better be careful, or he's going to arrest me by the power of his name alone! Edgeworth: (I somehow doubt that the Blue Badger has the power to arrest anyone.) Bad Badger boxes Edgeworth: So this is the Blue Badger's rival, the Bad Badger, huh. Do you feel some sort of reverence towards this Badger, Kay? Kay: ...Hah! I can't believe you would be so stereotypical when it comes to thieves! Surely you must also think there are much cooler, and cuter ones out there, right? That's it! I've decided that thieves and thievery need an image makeover! Edgeworth: (...Good luck with that one.) Proto Badger boxes Edgeworth: This is that Blue Badger I met at the main gate. Kay: Excuse me, but his name is \"Proto Badger\", not \"Blue Badger\"! He's based off of the very first design created by the local police chief. You know, when you compare the two, the Blue Badger looks a bit cuter! Edgeworth: I suppose as he continued to redesign him, the chief managed to make him cuter and cuter. Even humanity has come a long way when you think about how much we've evolved. Kay: Are we comparing the Blue Badger to humans now...? Pink Badger boxes Edgeworth: I suppose this is the Pink Badger? But since it has the same design, doesn't it seem forced to call this one a female? Kay: You think so? I mean, just look at how long her eyelashes are! Edgeworth: That's the only difference. Kay: And the fact that she's pink. Edgeworth: Yes, and? Kay: And her lips are red! See, lipstick! Edgeworth: .................. (What? She has nothing to say about the giant pink ribbon, or is that too obvious?) Boxes (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Boxes (subsequent times, after examining key) Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Beam Edgeworth: This is the beam I was tied to. ............ Kay: Hm? What's up? Edgeworth: I was pondering if perhaps we could make it over to and out the window if we climbed this. Kay: Good thinking! And if it's climbing action you need, just leave it to me! Edgeworth: Thanks. This little hook looks like it might make for a good foothold. Up you go, Kay, and good luck! Kay: Count on it! The Great Thief Yatagarasu spreads her mighty wings, and takes to the skies! Here I go! Kay: ............ Edgeworth: As I thought, this beam (The beam I was tied to - There is a hook on this beam, but it's not enough of a foothold to climb out with.) was definitely not made for climbing. Kay: What do you mean, \"As I thought\"!? I'm not your guinea pig, you know! Beam (subsequent times) Edgeworth: This is the beam I was tied to. ............ Just maybe, we can use this to climb up to and out the window. Kay: Leave it to me! ...............Wait. Didn't I just try this!? I can't climb this thing! Edgeworth: (I suppose we'll just have to find another way to escape.) Bad Badger head Edgeworth: What is this...? Kay: Looks like the Bad Badger, and it's looking as bad as ever! Edgeworth: Looks like a costume head to me. Kay: I guess the Bad Badger's costume is, at the very least, a two-piece, huh. Edgeworth: (The real question is, why is only the head sitting out here on the floor?) Bad Badger's Head data jotted down in my Organizer. Bad Badger head (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What is this...? Kay: Looks like the Bad Badger, and it's looking as bad as ever! Edgeworth: Looks like a costume head to me. Kay: I guess the Bad Badger's costume is, at the very least, a two-piece, huh. Edgeworth: (The real question is, why is only the head sitting out here on the floor?) Paint cans Kay: Maybe we can use this paint to help us escape... Edgeworth: And what exactly do you have in mind? Kay: Well, we could paint \"HELP\" in really giant letters! Edgeworth: And who, pray tell, would see these giant letters? We're inside a building. Kay: OK, then how about we light the paint on fire and send out colored smoke signals! Anyone who saw it would think some crazy arsonist was about, and call the cops! Hmm... Actually, that may not be all that great for me, seeing as I'm a thief and all. Edgeworth: ...Let's try to find something other than this paint to use, shall we? Photo rally sign Edgeworth: They're holding a Blue Badger photo rally? Kay: You didn't know? Plus, it's not just the Blue Badger, it's his whole family, too. If you manage to snap a shot of every member of the family, you get a really posh prize. Edgeworth: Well, there's a costume head sitting over there. Why not start with a picture of that? Kay: You can't do that! That's cheating! There's only one of each Badger in the park, so you have to work for it! Edgeworth: Speaking of Badgers, there was one sitting against a wall in the haunted house. Kay: Seriously? But somehow, I don't think that one counts, Mr. Edgeworth! You have to take pictures of the costumed ones walking around the park! Edgeworth: (Hmm... So these are the rules of this game? How quaint...) Badger Photo Rally data jotted down in my Organizer. Photo rally sign (subsequent times) Edgeworth: They're holding a Blue Badger photo rally? Kay: You didn't know? Plus, it's not just the Blue Badger, it's his whole family, too. If you manage to snap a shot of every member of the family, you get a really posh prize. Edgeworth: Well, there's a costume head sitting over there. Why not start with a picture of that? Kay: You can't do that! That's cheating! There's only one of each Badger in the park, so you have to work for it! Edgeworth: Speaking of Badgers, there was one sitting against a wall in the haunted house. Kay: Seriously? But somehow, I don't think that one counts, Mr. Edgeworth! You have to take pictures of the costumed ones walking around the park! Edgeworth: (Hmm... So these are the rules of this game? How quaint...) Door Edgeworth: Nnrgh... It seems that we won't be able to open this by ourselves. It also seems quite thick, so we can't just break it down. (There must be another way out of here.) Edgeworth: (Hm? Isn't this my phone? It looks like it made it through the ordeal intact.) Kay: If only there was [sic] a way for us to contact someone on the outside... Edgeworth: Ah, but we do have a way... right here. Kay: Ah! There was a cell phone here this whole time!? Edgeworth: If I'm right, Detective Gumshoe should have contacted the precinct for backup by now. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Are you OK!? I was so worried, sir! Edgeworth: I'm fine. I was knocked unconscious for a spell by the kidnapper, that's all. Gumshoe: I'm sorry, sir! I'm such a failure! If only I hadn't lost sight of you...! Edgeworth: Detective, we don't have time for this. Have the police set up a perimeter right now! Gumshoe: You don't have to worry about that, sir! I already got the boys working on that! But in doing that... I sorta... Aaaah...! Edgeworth: What's wrong, Detective? ???: ...Sorry to butt in, but I'm afraid you're going to have to make do (changed from [make due] in the original release, correcting the typo) with me. Edgeworth: Who is this? Lang: Shi-Long Lang of Interpol. A pleasure to speak with you, Mr. Edgeworth. I've heard a great deal about you. Edgeworth: So why exactly is an Interpol agent like yourself involved in a domestic kidnapping case? Lang: Don't sweat the details. A crime's a crime whether it's on a local or a global scale. Besides... ...you're the one who's in a world of trouble. Edgeworth: A-And why would you say that!? Lang: Lang Zi says: \"The pack that runs together, stays together.\" You catch my drift? You caused quite a ruckus by running blindly into a situation and then getting caught. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Lang: You should've contacted the police from the very beginning. Edgeworth: I'm sorry that this happened because of a lapse in judgement. However, I humbly request that you please help me out of here posthaste. Lang: ......Sorry, no can do. Edgeworth: What!? Lang: We're hunting the kidnapper now, and I haven't got any hands to spare. As I said, my pack moves as one. You're the one who wanted to go it alone, so good luck to you... Mr. Prosecutor. Oh, and once we do catch the kidnapper, rest assured we'll come find you... eventually. Edgeworth: ...You... You... Kay: What's wrong? Did you get cut off!? Edgeworth: No... My phone ran out of power. Kay: No way! Edgeworth: It doesn't matter anyway. We should try to get out of here through our own means. Kay: Yeah! I have a name to live up to, after all! If we put our heads together, we're sure to find a way out! Talk Kay Faraday The kidnapping (appears after examining cell phone, Bad Badger head, and photo rally sign) Edgeworth: Do you know where the person who kidnapped me went? Kay: Well, after they locked you up in here... ...it sounded like they went into the next room, and started talking to someone. Edgeworth: (I feel like I heard something as well, but it's all a haze in my mind. However, I do recall that the kidnapper was talking with someone... It was just a guess before, but I guess I really AM dealing with two kidnappers here.) Kay: After that, they left. It almost seemed as if they were done with you. Edgeworth: I suppose that is the case, as my kidnapping seems like an afterthought to the $1 million. Well, if they went into the next room, let's see what we can find out through the slot. Examine Door (after clearing \"The kidnapping\" Talk option) Kay: Ooh, we can peer into the room the kidnappers were in from there! Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Beam Edgeworth: There is a beam in the next room identical to the one in this room. There's even a hook on it to hold a propped-up floor panel in place. Which reminds me... Kay: Did you find something useful, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Hmm, perhaps. I may have found a very handy hint to how we'll get out of here. Hatch Edgeworth: Is that what I think it is? Kay: It looks like the kidnappers had an escape tunnel prepared just in case. That's awesome! They're like a bunch of Great Thieves themselves! Edgeworth: No, they're not, because I highly doubt they made the tunnel themselves. The floor panel was removed and propped up (Open floor panel - The panel is held in place by a hook. The entrance to an underground room perhaps?) against the beam in a very specific way. I think this building was originally built with a basement or underground area. Gray door Edgeworth: There's a door on the opposite side that appears to be the same as this one. Which would mean... ...that I can probably assume that these two rooms are very similar in structure. (I believe I may have just found our ticket out.) Door (subsequent times, after examining hatch) Kay: Ooh, we can peer into the room the kidnappers were in from there! Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Logic Connect \"Open floor panel\" and \"The beam I was tied to\" Leads to: \"This hook on this beam...\" Edgeworth: This hook on this beam... Kay: You know I already tried, and there's no way I can jump from this hook to the window! Come on, even you have to admit when something's just not possible. Edgeworth: Hah, I wasn't about to suggest that again. Rather, that it's here for a different purpose. Kay: Really!? Like what!? Edgeworth: As you saw in the adjacent room, it's clearly for keeping a floor panel propped up. Which means that there should be a panel in this room that we can open as well. Kay: Oh! I get it! Edgeworth: We didn't notice its existence all this time because it was being hidden by this tarp. Kay: Alright then! Let's fold this thing up and see what's underneath! Kay: Now THIS is what I call a treasure! Examine Closed hatch Kay: Wow, this must be another entrance to the secret, hidden basement! I totally smell treasure! Edgeworth: The scent I wish to smell is the sweet fragrance of freedom. Kay: Then what are you waiting for!? Hurry up and open the hatch! Edgeworth: Alright. .........Mmnph. This thing is locked down tight (Underground entrance - We might be able to escape through here, but the door is locked.). Kay: Aww! Fiddlesticks! Logic Connect \"Tiny key\" and \"Underground entrance\" Leads to: \"I believe you're up, Kay.\" Edgeworth: I believe you're up, Kay. Kay: Huh? Why me? Edgeworth: Because we need to use the tiny key that you've taken quite a liking to. Kay: Oh, gotcha! Just leave it to me! I love the tense feeling of these moments when you're about to uncover something big! Edgeworth: I believe the feeling of freedom would be much more satisfying right about now. Kay: Alright! I got the secret door open! And now...! Edgeworth: Ack! Wait! Kay: Wha--!? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: Are you alright!? Kay!? Kay: I'm fine. The ladder just slipped is all! Edgeworth: (Thank goodness she's alright. I about had a coronary...) Kay: There's a lot of really large machinery down here. Edgeworth: What about an exit? Kay: Umm... It's really dark and cramped down there, so I really doubt there's an exit. Argh, I can't believe that happened! Edgeworth: You have only yourself to blame for leaping before you looked, you know. Kay: No way! I mean, how was I supposed to know that the ladder is removable (Underground ladder - It looks as though it can be easily removed, but is it really safe to use...?)!? Examine Open hatch Edgeworth: (I finally got the door to the underground area open...) Kay, I just want to confirm with you that there wasn't an exit down there. Kay: Yeah, it was really cramped, and there was a lot of really large machinery. Edgeworth: I see. Are you hurt at all? Kay: I'm perfectly fine! I was just a little surprised when the ladder suddenly slipped out from under me... Edgeworth: (I wonder if this ladder can be put to some use...) Logic Connect \"Lockers\" and \"Underground ladder\" Leads to: \"I've figured out how we will escape this prison, Kay.\" Edgeworth: I've figured out how we will escape this prison, Kay. Kay: Oh? So, how are we going to bust out? Edgeworth: It seems that your reckless actions were of use after all. Kay: ...Are you actually praising me? Edgeworth: More of a \"thank you\" for giving me an idea regarding this ladder. Kay: The underground ladder? What about it? Edgeworth: This ladder isn't just for those who wish to go down... Kay: Oh! I see! If we use this...! Edgeworth: Yes, I believe it's long enough to reach the top of those lockers. Kay: Well, then what are we waiting for!? Investigation Complete Kay: Alright! Now we can get out of here! Edgeworth: Yes... We spent entirely too much time in here. (Kidnappers who held me hostage, and a mysterious Interpol agent... This case is only getting started, and I'll be the one to bring it to a resounding end!) March 13, 12:11 PM Wild, Wild West Area Edgeworth: It looks like it's stopped raining for now. Kay: Yeah, and thank goodness! You have no idea how hard it was raining earlier! ???: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm so glad to see you managed to escape, sir! I was so stressed that I thought my heart was gonna give out! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, may I ask what in the world that is? Gumshoe: Well, that's... um... MIB: Count off! 1! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 98! 99! MIB: Shifu! All 99 members are here and accounted for, sir! ???: Heh... What the heck do you think you're doing counting my cubs off like that!? Every person is a valuable human being, you get me? And everyone has a name that their parents gave to them. No one is a 2 or a 3... Everyone, regardless of age or rank, is number 1! Got it!? Shifu! Shifu! Edgeworth: ...You are Agent Lang, I take it? MIB: You infidel! How dare you address our Shifu so rudely!? Lang: Grr! Lang Zi says: \"A cub who disrespects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder.\" So don't you ever forget to show the proper respect towards another person! Shih-na. This isn't much, but please accept my card. Edgeworth: Oh, thank you. ...Please, accept mine in return. Lang: You all see that just now!? That is the proper way for two people to show their respect! Keep that in mind and you'll get far in life, got it!? Edgeworth: (Ah, that's right... Franziska did warn me... Something about an elite Interpol Agent from the Republic of Zheng Fa. Apparently, this man has the highest successful arrest rate in the organization.) Agent Lang, why exactly is an Interpol agent involved with this clearly domestic case? Lang: That's none of your business, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: How is it not!? Lang: I've heard a rumor or two about you. You solved a murder that occurred during your flight home recently, right? Hah! But you sure took a while just to arrest one little flight attendant. How pathetic. Gumshoe: H-How dare you say that about Mr. Edgeworth!? Are you saying you could've solved it faster, pal!? Lang: The comedic relief jumps to the aid (changed from [aide] in the original release) of his master... How cliché. Look, what I'm getting at is that if I had been there, no one would've died. Edgeworth: ! Lang: I would've solved the entire case and Agent Hicks would still be with us here today. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang knew yesterday's victim, Agent Akbey Hicks...?) Lang: Hicks was like a brother to me, so now, I'm out to take my revenge! Edgeworth: (Agent Hicks was investigating a smuggling ring with Franziska and a third person... This must be the man she was talking about.) In that case, you should understand how I feel, as the kidnapped is someone I know. So I ask that you please allow me to participate in the investigation... Lang: Lang: This isn't your neatly trimmed Courtroom of Eden, you know. You're out in the wilderness now, Mr. Prosecutor, and way out of your league. No hard feelings, but why don't you go on back to your courtroom now, pretty boy? Edgeworth: You...! You dare to mock the court!? Lang: I do... And I don't need the help of a filthy \"prosecutor\". Sorry, but the truth doesn't need the likes of you to distort it today! Edgeworth: (Who uses the adjective \"filthy\" to describe a prosecutor...!? And why...? Why do I feel such intense loathing emanating from him!?) Lang: Alright, men! Good job on the perimeter around Gatewater Land. Now just find me the kidnapper, and bring the punk to me! Dismissed! Sir! Lang: Now then, Mr. Prosecutor, you just sit tight here and don't cause any trouble, understand? Edgeworth: W-Wait! Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: It's been a while since I last met someone so disagreeable. (Why of all places did he show up here? And completely out of the blue at that! I suppose I'll have to ask Detective Gumshoe to fill me in on that.) Talk Kay Faraday Kay: Maaaan... I can't calmly do any stealing at all with that detective around. Edgeworth: I suppose it's not easy when there's this many members of law enforcement in the vicinity. Kay: It's alright! It's not like I'm in a hurry to steal just any ol' thing! Edgeworth: (...Which is it? Do you plan to steal something or not? Quite the mystery, this one. Maybe I should talk with her a bit more.) Talk Next step Kay: So what are you going to do about your investigation into the kidnapping? Edgeworth: Good question. Since Agent Lang holds the authority to investigate this case now... ...this makes things a bit more complicated. Kay: Oh, come on, you can't let that stop you! I'll even lend you a hand, so let's go! Edgeworth: But you're a self-purported \"Great Thief\", are you not? I don't believe I can let someone of an unlawful nature participate in an investigation. Kay: You don't like to listen, do you? I'm not just any ol' (changed from [ordinary] in the original release) Great Thief; I'm the Yatagarasu! And as I said earlier... ...the Yatagarasu is after one and only one thing. \"One and only one\" (appears after \"Next step\") Edgeworth: What is this \"one and only one\" thing you're after? Kay: The Yatagarasu is only interested in one thing... ...and that is the truth. Edgeworth: I see...  Edgeworth: It was seven years ago... There was a vigilante who threw the business world into a panic. Labeled \"mysterious\" and \"phantom-like\", the Yatagarasu appeared and vanished at will. Though we still don't know much about this thief's ultimate goal, we do know the targets. The Yatagarasu liked to find and publicly disclose (changed from [make public,] in the original release) evidence of corrupt dealings of all sorts. Once a target was chosen, no dramatic calling card or announcement was sent forth. Instead, the chosen corporation was infiltrated without even the target noticing. Some days later, the evidence that was found was sent out to the mass media... ...along with a card with the mark of a three-legged raven. Looking back, I suppose you could call what the Yatagarasu was stealing the \"truth\". (Could this child really be the successor to the original Yatagarasu? But that can't be... can it...?) Present Prosecutor's Badge Kay: If I had one of these, I could be a prosecutor, too, right? Edgeworth: Don't even think of stealing this from me. Kay: If it's that important to you, then why don't you wear it on your lapel? Edgeworth: (Why should I have to label myself as a prosecutor everywhere I go? And why does everyone ask that question of me? That's what I'D like to know.) Gatewater Land Pamphlet Kay: I really love theme parks! Too bad we're not here to have a fun time... Edgeworth: So why did you choose this one, and why choose to show yourself to me of all people? Kay: Because I was tailing you, silly! Duh! Edgeworth: You were following me!? (But why?) Blue Badger Bible Kay: It's a book of information about my arch-enemy, the Blue Badger. But I won't lose to the likes of him! You just wait and see. I'm going to write a \"Tome of Thievery\"! How's that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...The information that winds up on your wanted poster will suffice in this competition.) Badger Photo Rally Kay: Come on! The Badger family is waiting for us to find and take pictures of them! And remember, you have to yell, \"Badger GET!\" each time, or it doesn't count! Edgeworth: They even have a rule for when you take their pictures...? Kay: Tell me about it! I was planning to steal all of my shots, as any proper Great Thief should! Edgeworth: (Does the concept of stealing permeate every aspect of this girl's life...?) Anything else Kay: What do you think about this? Edgeworth: If you're going to steal anything, at least keep your hands off of my lines. Kay: Alright, alright. I'll return it to you. Here you go! Edgeworth: (I was hoping for some information in return, but my line will do for now.) Dick Gumshoe Edgeworth: Great job, Detective. Gumshoe: Sir! Edgeworth: For losing sight of me and the kidnapper, and allowing my investigation to be hijacked. Gumshoe: I... Sir...! Edgeworth: I look forward to your next month's salary assessment. Gumshoe: But... But the case isn't lost yet, sir! I'm gonna show you just how much of a man Dick Gumshoe can be! Edgeworth: Shall I prepare the 21-gun salute now or later? Talk Agent Lang Edgeworth: Detective, are you sure it was the precinct you called for backup? Gumshoe: O-Of course, sir! I think I would know the number to my own precinct like back of my hand! Edgeworth: Then why did an Interpol agent show up instead, with an army of his own agents? Gumshoe: That, I have no idea... About five minutes after I made the call, that wolf-man showed up out of nowhere, sir. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang definitely has an agenda, so the question is, \"What is he after?\") Next step (appears after \"Agent Lang\") Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! I was wondering if I may ask about one thing, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, what is it? Gumshoe: Um... Who is that? The girl over there, I mean. Kay: I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant, Kay Faraday! Gumshoe: Wh-Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: Funny, I don't recall making you my assistant, Kay... Gumshoe: Yeah! I'M Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! ME! It's been like that since... forever! Kay: Sorry, but I just stole your supporting role. Gumshoe: How can you say something so serious with that giant grin on your face, pal!? Mr. Edgeworth! We've got a thief on our hands, sir! She stole my role, sir! I'm taking her in, getting her convicted, and making sure she serves out her sentence! Kay: Oh, come on, it'll be fun! Like musical chairs! You'd better stay fast on your feet! Gumshoe: No way! I won't... I will not lose the spotlight to you, little girl! Present Prosecutor's Badge Gumshoe: If you're going to show me your Prosecutor's Badge, then I'll show you my police badge! Edgeworth: ...Your wallet is looking rather thin, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? Oh, whoops. I must've left my badge at home. I always get the two mixed up. Ha ha. Edgeworth: That's not a laughing matter, Detective! Gatewater Land Pamphlet Gumshoe: Gatewater Land... Who would have guessed this place would be such a success? But the Gatewater Group and I go way back, you know? Edgeworth: Yes... Same here. I handled two murder cases that took place at two of their hotels. And it was you who headed the investigation in each case. Gumshoe: Oh, I remember that, sir! I was 16 back then, standing in front of the hotel in the snow... Edgeworth: (...Clearly, we are not on the same page here.) Blue Badger Bible Gumshoe: You actually got a copy, Mr. Edgeworth!? Ooh! Can you show me the very last page!? Edgeworth: The last page? Very well... Let's see here... ...Interesting. Why is your name listed here under \"Special Thanks\"? Gumshoe: That's it, sir! You found it! Oh... Um... That's because I did the choreography for the \"Dance, Dance, Blue Badger\" song! Edgeworth: (I suspect that no one entrusts him with any real responsibilities at work...) Badger Photo Rally Gumshoe: Oh, are you participating in the photo rally, too, Mr. Edgeworth!? Um... I mean, I'm only doing it as part of my duties! Yeah. Edgeworth: ...I see. In that case, keep up the good work. So, how many have you found so far? Gumshoe: I've been sorta busy with the investigation, so I haven't really found any yet, but... Edgeworth: (Something tells me finding the Badgers isn't really a part of his duties.) Anything else Gumshoe: I'm sorry, sir! Absolutely nothing is coming to mind right now! As a man, the only thing I can attest to is this: \"To be a man, I, Dick Gumshoe, will tell no lie!\" Edgeworth: (His heart's in the right place... Now to work on his deduction skills.) Officers Edgeworth: Excuse me, but if you could just let me through here... Officer: Sorry, I can't let anyone through. Agent Lang's orders. Edgeworth: Nnngh... (I suppose I'll have to deal with this impasse for now.) Blue Badger Blue Badger: .................. Edgeworth: (That wriggling... I just can't bring myself to call it \"dancing\"...) Examine Barrels on left side Edgeworth: I highly doubt I'll find a clue in here, but I might as well check, just to be sure. ...Mnngh. This barrel sure is heavy. You there! Do you know what's inside of this thing? Officer: It's the emergency water supply for putting out fires. Edgeworth: ...I see. Well, they certainly are well prepared. Horizontal bar Edgeworth: This horizontal bar is used... for tying up horses. Apparently, you can ride real horses at the Cowboy's Ranch area just up ahead. Is it possible that the culprits have already escaped with the help of a stolen horse or two? Officer: Under Agent Lang's orders, we already rounded up all the horses... ...and every last one has been accounted for. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang is good, although, I won't go so far as to say I'm impressed just yet...) Rocking chair Edgeworth: It's an old-fashioned rocking chair, the kind that makes you feel instantly at ease. There's something written here... \"A soothing 10-minute sitting for only $100\"...!? I see. Reverse psychology. Make it so expensive that no one would dare sit on it... Barrels by cactus Edgeworth: It's an empty barrel. I'd venture to guess that its only purpose is to set the mood. Cactus Edgeworth: It's a cactus... and there's something written here on this sign... \"This cactus is a very gracious gift to Gatewater Land from the local police precinct.\" (I can't believe the police went so far as to even donate a cactus to this place.) Garage door Edgeworth: Horses are painted on this garage door to complete the Wild West theme. They almost look like they're ready to jump out into the real world and gallop away. ...Almost, being the key word. Tracks Edgeworth: Some sort of tracks were left in the mud here thanks to the rain. They look like tire tracks. Too bad they're destroying the Wild West atmosphere they worked so hard to create. (The tires on whatever made these probably got pretty muddy, as well.) After clearing all Talk options with Dick Gumshoe and Kay Faraday: ???: Laaaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, son!? Edgeworth: Mr. Amano? Ernest: Oh! Miles, my boy! I'm sorry to involve you in such an affair just after you've returned. Edgeworth: For you, Mr. Amano, I gladly offer my assistance. After all, I have you to thank for how well things turned out during my time abroad. If it wasn't [sic] for you, I might not have been introduced to that law office... ...and had the chance to study the inner workings of another country's judicial system. Ernest: No, no, no. Think nothing of it. As you know, Manfred and I go way back. I consider a beloved disciple of his to be like one of my own blood. Edgeworth: ............ Ernest: If you ever want to go overseas again, you need only to ask. I can use my company's vast network to send you anywhere at any time. Kay: So who's the old man? Edgeworth: He is the father of the currently kidnapped Lance Amano, Ernest Amano. Ernest: Now then, have you found Lance yet, Miles? Please... I miss my poor boy dearly! Edgeworth: I'm terribly sorry, but your son's whereabouts remain unknown, Mr. Amano. Ernest: Wh-- Hold on there! Then, what happened to all that money!? Edgeworth: .........I believe the $1 million has been stolen, and that the culprits are now on the run. Ernest: Whaaaaat!? Kay: Poor old man... Don't you have anything you could give him to cheer him up, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (Forgive me, Mr. Amano...) Talk Ernest Amano Talk The kidnapping Edgeworth: I was wondering if you could please tell me the details of the kidnapping one more time? Ernest: Oh. It was yesterday... A call came to the house. From the receiver came the sound of my son... \"Help me, Daddy!\"... *sniff* Edgeworth: I know this is tough, but please stay with me here, Mr. Amano... Ernest: You don't understand. He hasn't called me \"Daddy\" in ages... It was incredibly moving... I wish I had recorded him saying that. Edgeworth: (He definitely should have recorded that conversation... ...but not for the foolish sentimentalities of an old man.) Lance Amano Edgeworth: Refresh my memory, what kind of person is Lance again? Ernest: How will telling you about Lance help you get him back? Edgeworth: Surprisingly, a lot can be deduced from a person's relationships and behavior. Ernest: Very well, then. Lance is my one and only son, and he turned 21 this year. He is very much like me when I was his age -- kind and very attractive. I'm sure women simply can't keep their hands off of him. Edgeworth: Is there anything else about him you noticed of late? Ernest: Now that you mention it, I haven't been able to get in contact with our butler, Oliver. Edgeworth: Your butler...? Ernest: Yes, his name is Oliver Deacon. He's been with our family for years now. He gets along so well with Lance, so I thought maybe he would know where my son is... Oliver Deacon (appears after \"Lance Amano\") Edgeworth: Mr. Amano, could you please tell me a little more about your butler, Mr. Deacon? Ernest: As a butler, he's outstanding. He even serves as Lance's personal private tutor. He took a brief leave recently, but even after it was over, I haven't been able to reach him. Edgeworth: So you still haven't spoken with him since his leave? What about his family and friends? Ernest: They said they hadn't seen him. I've tried everything I could think of, Miles. ...Do you think this could have something to do with Lance's kidnapping? Edgeworth: It's possible, but I can't say anything for sure quite yet. (So even the person closest to the victim has gone missing... Oliver Deacon... Sounds like one name I had better keep in mind.) Present Prosecutor's Badge Ernest: Ah... Seeing that badge reminds me of Manfred. Now, HE was one fine prosecutor, the best of the best. Edgeworth: ...Yes, I can't disagree with you there. Ernest: Hmm... I sense that you don't really want to talk about him. Edgeworth: How I feel about him... It's hard for me to be truthful about that with another person. Ernest: Your hard countenance... I don't know what you're thinking or feeling... ...but mark my words, I think you are Manfred's true successor. I really do. Edgeworth: .................. Anything else Ernest: Ho, ho! That looks to be something with quite a bit of value. But then, all things have some value attached to them. Only by probing deep into the unknown can we become true winners in this world, Miles. Edgeworth: (Thanks, but knowledge isn't what's going to make me a winner here; it's information.) After clearing all Talk options with Ernest Amano: Edgeworth: .................. Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Let's begin our investigation. Even if that Interpol agent holds the authority to head this investigation... ...we can't allow ourselves to stand idly by, twiddling our thumbs. Gumshoe: I'm with you 100%, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! I, Dick Gumshoe, pledge to stick by your side through thick and thin! Edgeworth: Mr. Amano, it was my fault that the culprits escaped. Which is why, with your blessing, I vow to return Lance to you myself. Ernest: Oh! I've never seen you so passionate before, Miles. Good luck to you, my boy. Kay: Alright! Well, what are you waiting for!? Let's do some investigating! Gumshoe: If you think I'm losing to you, pal, forget it! Begin Investigation Wild, Wild West Area Gumshoe: So what should we examine first!? Edgeworth: Hmm... Thanks to Agent Lang, we can't leave this area. But the culprits were here until only very recently. Which means we may be able to find some clues that will tell us how they escaped. Gumshoe: OK! Let's get looking! Detective: Hey! You there! Gumshoe: Who, me!? Detective: What are you doing goofing off in a place like this!? Gumshoe: I wasn't goofing off! I was about to help Mr. Edgeworth kick off his investigation. Detective: You imbecile! All precinct detectives are now under Agent Lang's direct command! Gumshoe: N-No way! I am NOT working for Wolf-boy! Mr. Edgeworth! Can't you do something...!? Edgeworth: .................. I'm not exactly in a position to argue, seeing as how you ARE a member of the police. Detective: Good, now let's go! Gumshoe: Nooooooooooooooooooooooo!!! Detective: Boy, have I got just the job for someone of your talents! Kay: Well, that was exciting. Edgeworth: ............ Kay. Kay: What? Can't you tell I'm all ready to get down to some detective work!? Edgeworth: You should go home. Your parents must be worried about you. Kay: Oh, come on! I finally get to be your assistant and you try to ditch me!? Edgeworth: ...I don't recall offering you the position. Kay: Hmmmph. Why do you have to be so difficult? Besides, it's already too late, you know! Like I said, I've already stolen the position of \"assistant\" a while back! Edgeworth: Hah. You're the only one asserting that. Kay: Well! By the time anyone notices, it's already gone! That's the Yatagarasu way! Edgeworth: You shouldn't speak so lightly of things you know nothing about! Kay: Fine, whatever, you win. Go ahead and do your little investigation. But the talented assistant Kay, is going to tag along no matter what you say! Edgeworth: (Even if she turns out to be useless, she's not going to listen to me. I might as well surrender and let her come along for the ride...) Talk Blue Badger Blue Badger: .................. Kay: Hey! It's the Blue Badger! Badger GET! Edgeworth: (I really don't understand why she is so excited over this badger hunt. Speaking of Badgers, there's a person inside of there...) Mr. Badger, I wonder if you might share with me what you saw? Blue Badger: .................. Edgeworth: (He's doing that contorted wriggling \"dance\" again...) Kay: ............ Aha! ???: Aaaah! You've uncovered my undercover identity, sir! I was to remain under that head, sir! Edgeworth: ...Aren't you Officer Meekins? Meekins: SIR! Mike Meekins, reporting for duty, sir! Edgeworth: (This man was a witness in one of the cases I headed two years ago. About the only thing I remember about this officer is that... ...he often spoke and acted before he thought, which gave me a great deal of headaches.) Kay: Is he a friend of yours, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: I've met him in the courtroom once before. (Hmm... Why was he so upset when we unmasked him? Does he have something to hide?) Mike Meekins (after talking to Blue Badger) Talk Mike Meekins Edgeworth: Officer Meekins, why are you standing here wasting time? Meekins: SIR! Because I'm not a police officer right now, sir! I'm the Blue Badger! And I'm creating memories and dreams for the kids! That's never a waste of time, sir! I have a dream to become as big as Detective Gumshoe, sir! I was patrolling the scorchingly boring beat until a little while ago... ...when the dispatch radio on my shoulder crackled that the kidnappers had escaped, sir! I thought maybe this was my shot at making Detective, sir! I rushed on over to join in, but when I got here, there was a sea of people already... ...and I couldn't spread my trademark friendliness and joy on to anyone... Edgeworth: (It would seem that some people never change...) The Blue Badger Edgeworth: So why exactly are you in that ridiculous outfit? Meekins: Sir! That's because, sir! I'm here to keep the visitors in good spirits, sir! But it's also to hide the fact that I'm an officer on the trail of a kidnapper, sir! Edgeworth: I see. Agent Lang is very wise to employ this sort of diversionary tactics. Meekins: To be handed the role of THE Blue Badger out of all the different disguises, sir... It's... It's such an honor! Any clues? (appears after \"The Blue Badger\") Edgeworth: How long have you been standing here, Officer? Meekins: SIR! For about one little hour, sir! Edgeworth: (Hmm... That's around the time I woke up from being knocked unconscious...) Meekins: And I've been here even since, sir! Edgeworth: (If that's true, then it's possible Officer Meekins saw the kidnappers escaping!) Meekins: B-B-B-However, sir! I must tell you I didn't see a thiiiiiiing, sir!!! Edgeworth: I haven't asked you anything yet, Officer. Meekins: No no no no no! B-But I know you will, sir! Edgeworth: (He's hiding something from me.) Officer Meekins, I insist that you tell me more about your recent movements! Meekins: Sir! I've been playing the Blue Badger this whole time, sir! And getting into it, too! I patrolled the park, all while wearing this costume! And about one hour ago, I came over here, sir! I haven't seen any suspicious-looking people this whole time, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: What you said just now is contradictory to the facts. Kay: How so, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: This is what Officer Meekins's testimony contradicts! Present Badger Photo Rally Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Officer Meekins, let's back things up. I'd like to ask you about your last statement.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your testimony contradicts this piece of evidence! Meekins: I'm just a little patrolman, so I don't understand what you're talking about, sir! Kay: I can't say I get it, either. Edgeworth: (Gnnnrk! This isn't what I was looking for!) I'm sorry, Officer, but could you please repeat what you said one more time? Meekins: Of course, sir! I'd be honored to repeat myself as many times as needed, sir! For almost a whole little hour, I didn't see any suspicious-looking people around, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: As I thought, what you said just now is contradictory to the facts. Kay: OK, so what exactly is so contradictory, Mr. Edgeworth? Leads back to: \"This is what Officer Meekins's testimony contradicts!\" Edgeworth: Officer Meekins, let's back things up. I'd like to ask you about your last statement. Meekins: Sir! Of course, sir! If that's your wish, Mr. Prosecutor! This little patrolman will wait as long as I am commanded to wait! Edgeworth: You said that you saw a Blue Badger, correct? And yet, if you take a look at this, what you saw was not supposed to happen. This park is supposed to have only one of each Badger in it at any given time. Which means that as long as you are the Blue Badger, Officer Meekins... ...you should not have seen another Blue Badger wandering the premises! Meekins: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!? SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!? Kay: Then, that would mean that there are two Blue Badgers (A 2nd Blue Badger - There's only supposed to be 1 Blue Badger in the park, but a second was spotted.) walking around! But why!? Any clues? (subsequent times) Edgeworth: How long have you been standing here, Officer? Meekins: SIR! For about one little hour, sir! Edgeworth: (Hmm... That's around the time I woke up from being knocked unconscious...) Meekins: And I've been here even since, sir! Edgeworth: (If that's true, then it's possible Officer Meekins saw the kidnappers escaping!) Meekins: Yup, I've been hanging around in this area ever since then, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: And yet, if you take a look at this, what you saw was not supposed to happen. This park is supposed to have only one of each Badger in it at any given time. Which means that as long as you are the Blue Badger, Officer Meekins... ...you should not have seen another Blue Badger wandering the premises! Meekins: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!? SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!? Kay: But then, that would mean that there are two Blue Badgers walking around the park! Present Prosecutor's Badge Meekins: Sir! It's so incredibly shiny, but it has a really ugly shape! I knew it! I was right to go for the much more manly police badge, sir! But I lose it alot [sic], and I just know I'm going to lose it for real one of these days, sir! Kay: ...Mr. Edgeworth, I think this cop is one donut short of a baker's dozen. Edgeworth: I know. Believe me, I know. Blue Badger Bible Meekins: Sir! You have a copy of the Blue Badger Bible, too, sir!? That was written by experts on the Badger family, sir! And it's very, very thorough! It doesn't matter that I was made the Blue Badger only a little while ago, sir! That book helped me memorize every name of every Badger, sir! Edgeworth: (It's not that hard to remember four incredibly obvious names...) Badger Photo Rally Meekins: Drip, drop, little by little our privacy is being sold off to the public through this, sir! But that means I need to work extra hard on my cute poses! Kay: Ooh, like what? Meekins: Like thiiiiiiiiiiis! Kay: Great! Now I know what your new pose will beeeeeeeeeee! Look, sir! I've successfully stolen his pose and speaking styyyyyyyyyyyyyle, sir! Edgeworth: *sigh* That's nice, Kay. Anything else Meekins: Sir! I'm undercover as the Blue Badger now, sir! I must pretend to not know anything about anything, sir! Edgeworth: (I mustn't respond to that. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel...) Ernest Amano Present Stolen Costumes Ernest: Just what sort of operation is this, that they would allow their valuables to be stolen!? It's a disgrace to the way businesses are run everywhere! Edgeworth: Well, thieves, by nature. generally tend to target these types. Ernest: Stealing is an abominable behavior, don't you agree, little miss!? Kay: ...Y-Yeah, the worst! Edgeworth: (Am I going to have to add \"hypocrite\" to the list of things you are, missy?) Examine Barrels on left side Kay: Hah! I've got you now, you vile criminals! Edgeworth: ...I'd think the kidnappers would have better sense than to try hiding in these. Kay: Oh, come on! Lighten up, will ya? I was only joking! I don't REALLY think that the criminals would be hiding here, right in front of two officers! Edgeworth: ...I-I certainly hope not. Footprints Kay: Hey! There's a bunch of footprints in the mud over here! Edgeworth: I remember hearing rain fall out here while I was being held in there. Kay: Yup, it was just a passing rain. That's why the ground has already pretty much dried up. Edgeworth: I should be thankful. It left us with some nice footprint samples. Kay: You know what? I bet if we followed them, we can find out where the kidnappers went! Plus, we'd be able to spot them because of their muddy shoes! Edgeworth: ...I don't think it will be that easy. Kay: Why not? Edgeworth: Look carefully. There are quite a few different sets here. And we don't know which ones belong to the kidnappers. Kay: Oh, that's true... We don't know what kind of shoes (What kind of shoes? - If only we knew, we'd be able to track the kidnappers from the footprints.) they were wearing. Horizontal bar Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth, isn't this one of those things you tie horses to? Edgeworth: Yes, although the horses are in another location at the moment. Kay: Aww... And here I was hoping I would get to ride one. Edgeworth: You know how to ride a horse? Kay: Nope! Never rode one in my life! But I have an Asian friend who was born in the year of the horse! Edgeworth: (\"Non sequitur\" is the only way to describe your logic...) Barrels by cactus Kay: If these were real, I wonder what you'd put in them. Edgeworth: Water would be the obvious answer... Kay: But if you stored water in a barrel under the blazing hot sun, wouldn't it go bad? Edgeworth: People of that period probably didn't care about how it tasted. Kay: Sorry, but I can't let you get away with making fun of our forefathers! I mean, maybe they really liked the strange taste! Edgeworth: ...Look who's making fun of them now. Cactus Kay: Look! There's a blurb about the cactus here! \"This cactus is a very gracious gift to Gatewater Land from the local police precinct.\" Edgeworth: (I can't believe the police went so far as to even donate a cactus to this place.) Kay: So, is the police department running a cactus farm on the side? Ha ha, just kidding! They wouldn't do something so silly! Edgeworth: (Actually, I have the vague impression I've seen a cactus farm at the precinct before.) Garage door Edgeworth: Horses are painted on this garage door to complete the Wild West theme. Kay: They look so life-like, don't you think!? Edgeworth: Are you thinking of wrangling, or rather, stealing them? Kay: If you can coax them out of there, sure! Come on, I know you can sweet-talk them out! Edgeworth: I could be holding a cube of sugar in my hand and they wouldn't budge, Kay. Tracks Edgeworth: It's a set of tire tracks originating from the garage. Kay: Aha! So that means a car left from the garage at some time, right? Edgeworth: Correct. But for the car to leave these tracks... ...it would mean that it left during the passing rain. (That's the only explanation as to why these tracks are made of mud.) Hmm, three treads... I think we can also safely assume it's a special type of car. Logic Connect \"Costumes\" and \"A 2nd Blue Badger\" Edgeworth: A second Blue Badger that shouldn't exist... Clearly, the true identity of the person underneath is... Kay: Oh, I know! It's one of the kidnappers, right!? The person wore a costume to get away (Costumed escape - The identity of the second Blue Badger was probably the kidnapper in disguise.)! Edgeworth: Precisely. After all, the costumes that went missing from the storage area are... Kay: ...A Blue Badger, a Proto Badger, and a Bad Badger. Edgeworth: Yes, those three. Kay: So there are three phony Badgers running around in the park somewhere, huh! Stolen Costumes data jotted down in my Organizer. Connect \"What kind of shoes?\" and \"Costumed escape\" Leads to: \"Now that we know that the kidnappers were wearing Badger costumes...\" Partner Kay: Yes? Talk The kidnapping Edgeworth: Kay, what do you think about the kidnapping? Kay: Well, I don't know anything about the victim... ...so actually, I was hoping you could tell me. Edgeworth: Ah, that's right. I never did explain the situation to you. I got involved because of a phone call I received. It was from none other than the director of the Amano Group, Mr. Ernest Amano. His only son, Lance, had been kidnapped, and he wanted me to be the drop-off man. Little did I suspect that I would be abducted myself. Kay: And that's when I found you tied to a pole screaming, \"Nnnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!!\" Edgeworth: Can you please drop that already!? Present Prosecutor's Badge Kay: If I had one of these, I could be a prosecutor, too, right? Edgeworth: Don't even think of stealing this from me. Kay: If it's that important to you, then why don't you wear it on your lapel? Edgeworth: (I suppose I can't really tell her... ...that no one in the Prosecutor's Office wears their badges. But why does everyone ask that question of me? That's what I'D like to know.) Stolen Costumes Kay: Looks like there's another thief afoot! Edgeworth: Only if we assume that this is not your handiwork. Kay: Are you kidding!? You know that the Blue Badger is enemy number one to me! Can you imagine me ever being on good terms with that thing!? Edgeworth: .................. Actually, it's surprisingly easy. Edgeworth: Now that we know that the kidnappers were wearing Badger costumes... ...those footprints from earlier take on a new, and very significant meaning. Kay: Oh, you mean now we know which tracks belong to the kidnappers, right!? Edgeworth: Yes. More than shoe prints, we need to follow the paw prints of Badgers. Kay: OK, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to use those footprints and go Badger hunting! Examine Footprints Leads to: \"Hmm... So we're looking for footprints made by a costume...\" Kay: Hmm... So we're looking for footprints made by a costume... Hey! I think I found them! There are two sets here! Edgeworth: They both do look like possible candidates. Kay: This set is walking off to the west... Argh! It just stops! I can't make heads or tails of where it's headed from here! Edgeworth: I think we can assume it's headed towards the stadium... Kay: Hmm... I wonder where the other set leads? This one seems to be headed east... Huh? Quick, Mr. Edgeworth! I've got him! I got one of the culprits! Meekins: Aaaah! Nooooo! I'm not a kidnapper, sir!!! Edgeworth: Down, Kay. Clearly, those footprints belong to Officer Meekins. But our criminals were each wearing a costume. Kay: Aha! Maybe they came over to this garage for something? Edgeworth: That's what I would suppose. Officer Meekins, if you could step aside for a moment. We need to examine the garage. Meekins: SIR! Roger Wilco, sir! Examine Garage door Leads to: \"Let's open this shutter and see what we find.\" Footprints Edgeworth: There are two sets of prints that could be from the kidnappers... Kay: One set is headed off to the west... Edgeworth: To the stadium, I would suppose... Kay: And the other set heads to the east... Edgeworth: We should follow these prints to their conclusion and investigate the garage. Kay: OK! Edgeworth: Let's open this shutter and see what we find. Kay: Maybe we'll find the kidnappers hiding inside! Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Edgeworth: Wh-What in the--!? (We seem to have stumbled across a dead body...) Kay: ............ Edgeworth: (She must be in severe shock to have been the first to find it... Now then, who is this man?) Ernest: I-It's Oliver! Edgeworth: ! Mr. Amano, are you saying that this man is... Ernest: Yes... He's my butler... How could something like this have happened!? Edgeworth: (Indeed. And why was Mr. Deacon here to begin with? I'd better investigate this crime scene quickly, before Agent Lang or his men return. The kidnapper's footprints lead right to this garage... ...and right to a dead body. Is it possible one of the kidnappers is now a murder victim (Victim was kidnapper? - Following a kidnapper's prints led us to a body. Was the victim in a costume?)...?) From my cursory examination, I believe this man died of a fatal bullet wound. Preliminary Findings data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: You sure are calm for someone who just found a body. Edgeworth: (It's surprising what one can become accustomed to in the span of two days...) Leads to examination of body Talk Ernest Amano Edgeworth: Mr. Amano... This body... Ernest: Yes... That's my butler, Oliver... How could something like this have happened!? Edgeworth: (Indeed. And why was Mr. Deacon here to begin with?) Examine Footprints Edgeworth: There are two sets of prints that could be from the kidnappers... Kay: One set is headed off to the west... Edgeworth: To the stadium, I would suppose... Kay: And the other set heads to the east... Edgeworth: ...Right to the garage. (Do these prints belong to the victim we found inside the garage?) Rocking chair Kay: Ooh, did you know? I really love this kind of chair, the way it rocks back and forth! When I grow old, I plan to sit in one of these and rock the day away every day! But you don't have to wait, Mr. Edgeworth! You're at just the right age for one! Edgeworth: (Do I really project myself as someone of that age?) Blue Badgermobile Edgeworth: What a peculiar car... Kay: Yeah. From the look of it, it must be the Blue Badgermobile. And it has three tires... So maybe it left those tire tracks behind!? Edgeworth: *sigh* That's simply not possible. Kay: Huh? Why? Edgeworth: Take a look at the tires. There's no mud stuck to them. Therefore, it must have been here since before it started to rain. Kay: Oh, gotcha! Good eye! Edgeworth: (It's a shame I don't see any other clues around...) Body Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Examine Pendant Edgeworth: (This is an unusually-shaped pendant...) Kay: What is it? Is it something valuable? Edgeworth: (She seems to have regained some of her composure...) Kay: It looks like a horse pendant! It's got an antique feel about it, and it's really pretty... Hold on... This is made of platinum silver! Nice! It IS worth something after all! Ooh, and look! There's something written on the back. \"Colin Devorae\"... It's a name. Edgeworth: \"Colin Devorae\"...? (But this man's name is...) Wounds Edgeworth: (As long as that Interpol agent has control of this case... ...I'm not going to be able to have a real autopsy done on the victim. I'm no doctor, but let's see what I can piece together myself.) Hmm, there are two gunshot wounds one in his abdomen and one in his shoulder. Kay: So that means he was shot twice...? Edgeworth: No, I don't think so. I think the abdominal one is an entry wound, and the one near his shoulder is the exit wound. Kay: Nice! I knew you could figure it out! Edgeworth: It comes with experience, and I've seen my share of crime scenes. (Speaking of experience... ...this crime scene seems a bit too clean for a murder where the bullet went clean through. I should make a note of this oddity.) Preliminary Findings data updated in my Organizer. Wounds (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Hmm, there are two gunshot wounds one in his abdomen and one in his shoulder. Kay: So that means he was shot twice...? Edgeworth: No, I don't think so. I think the abdominal one is an entry wound, and the one near his shoulder is the exit wound. Kay: Nice! I knew you could figure it out! Edgeworth: It comes with experience, and I've seen my share of crime scenes. (Speaking of experience... ...this crime scene seems a bit too clean for a murder where the bullet went clean through. I should make a note of this oddity.) Deduce pendant (after examining pendant) Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Preliminary Findings Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's something not right about the name on the pendant. The victim is the Amano family butler, and his name is \"Oliver Deacon\". But the name on the pendant is \"Colin Devorae\". Kay: I wonder what's up with that? Edgeworth: I don't know, but... ...I think we've hit upon an important piece of information. Mr. Deacon's Pendant data jotted down in my Organizer. Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence alone solves this whole case! Kay: Really!? You think so!? Because to be honest, I don't really see how it solves anything... You must be confused jumping from a kidnapping to a murder. Yeah, that's it! Edgeworth: (Nngh! I can't believe I made such a large blunder... ...that even this little girl could point it out!) Leads back to examination of body Examine evidence Mr. Deacon's Pendant Front side Edgeworth: It's the victim's pendant, which is shaped like a horse. Kay: It's got a real dignified look on its face. That makes it worth all the more... ! Oh no, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What? Did you find an important piece of evidence? Kay: This... is made of platinum silver! That makes this thing super-valuable! I've seen this type of jewelry at a lot of stores before, so I know it when I see it! Edgeworth: ............Kay, if you ever laid so much as a finger on those pieces of jewelry... Kay: Wh-What? Me? I-I'd never do something like that! Edgeworth: (......Is it possible that she has never wanted to steal from a jewelry store before?) Name on back Edgeworth: The name \"Colin Devorae\" is engraved here. Kay: I really admire people who carve their own names into a pendant. Edgeworth: Oh? And why would that be? Kay: You have no imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. Did you ever think that maybe people want to have their loved ones always nearby? Edgeworth: It's not as if I have a wedding band, and I have no interest in accessorizing. Kay: *sigh* I suppose. Anyway, you know what? More than wearing flashy accessories... ...I'd rather be engraving my name into every treasure I can find all around the world! Edgeworth: (A sign of affection is one thing, but blatant vandalizing is just a bit different.) Partner Talk The murder Edgeworth: It appears that this case has taken a turn for the unexpected. Kay: I'll say! I was shocked to open that shutter and find a dead body inside! Edgeworth: I suppose most people would be, since the average person rarely runs across a corpse. Kay: Wait! You just compared me to a \"normal person\", didn't you!? I'll have you know that I'm... Edgeworth: Sorry. I suppose I should have recognized that you're a... thief, correct? Kay: No! I'm a GREAT Thief! And a GREAT Thief is not surprised by anything! Got it!? Edgeworth: (Apparently, with GREAT thievery comes GREAT loss of short-term memory.) Present Mr. Deacon's Pendant Kay: This horse is really pretty... Edgeworth: Don't even think about it. Kay: OK, I'll just hold onto it then! Don't worry, it's safe with me! Edgeworth: (Just so we're clear, Kay, a five-finger discount is not part of the bargain.) After examining wounds and correctly deducing pendant: Investigation Complete ???: Laaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, sweetie!? Edgeworth: Excuse me, but you are...? ???: *ba-dump* Edgeworth: ? ???: Oh, this is bad... He's really good looking! Ack! Stop it, Lauren! You can't let yourself fall for a playboy like him! You're in love with... Kay: Sounds like someone doesn't know the meaning of the phrase \"inner monologue\", huh? Edgeworth: Sorry to interrupt your... conversation, but might you be a friend of Lance? ???: Yes, I'm Lance's girlfriend... My name is Lauren Paups. Edgeworth: His girlfriend...? Paups: Oh, it's not like that! We're more like friends... and, um... We're not lovers or anything! We! Well, we haven't gotten that far yet! But... I guess that's how people are going to see it, so I should just accept it... I even got this ring as a present from Lance... *swoon* Kay: Ha ha, you know what she reminds of? A cartoon character! Edgeworth: N...Nnnnrrrghn... May I inquire as to why you are here? Paups: I haven't been able to get in contact with Lance lately... ...and I began to get really worried. *sob* I looked everywhere for him, and then I heard about the kidnapping, so I came here. Kay: Wow, you're really strong for having made it through all this by yourself! Paups: Um! Is it true!? Has Lance really been kidnapped!? Edgeworth: ...No one is supposed to know, but yes, it's true. Paups: Oh, Lance...! I can't believe you've been spirited away... I wonder how you're doing right now... Kay: Looks like she's gone back to the \"fair maiden in love\" routine... So, Mr. Edgeworth, where do we go from here? Edgeworth: Well, we found a body, so we should look into the murder... ???: Lang: My men brought me up to speed over the radio. And I have to say, you really should've called. I heard you found something very intriguing. Edgeworth: I have nothing to hide, Agent Lang. It's exactly what you see before you. Lang: I'll take it from here. Yeah, that guy's really dead. Hey! You waiting for an invitation? Hurry up and detain the suspect, now. Edgeworth: (Suspect? Who...?) Lang: Officer Meekins, is it? You're coming with us. Meekins: What!? SIR! I had nothing to do with it, sir! Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Don't you think you're being a bit rash!? Do you even have a good reason to suspect Officer Meekins!? Lang: Hah, I leave that kind of stuff to you prosecutors. It's your job, after all. Like I said earlier, the crime scene isn't as forgiving as your precious courtroom. Edgeworth: That's your answer!? Lang: I know you like your logic and reasoning... ...but that sort of impractical fluff is not needed out here in the field. Edgeworth: ! Lang: All you have to do is arrest suspicious person after suspicious person. That's how you eliminate crime from the streets! Edgeworth: But that's also precisely how you unnecessarily arrest innocent people by mistake! Lang: \"Innocent people\"? Nonsense! There's no such thing as an innocent person. We've all got a blemish or two in our hearts. Edgeworth: That's tyranny! I won't allow such a thing to go on unchecked before my eyes! Lang: Heh! Too bad you don't call the shots around here! Edgeworth: As I have sworn to uphold the laws of this land, I cannot allow you to take this man in. That you would arrest a man on false charges without even conducting an investigation... ...have you no honor as a member of law enforcement!? MIB: You! How dare you speak so disrespectfully to our Shifu!? Lang: Hold it! .................. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You amuse me, Mr. Prosecutor. Lang Zi says: \"Every pack has its own rules.\" If you can play by their rules and come out on top, that is a true victory. Alright, I'll give your beloved laws a fair shake. I'll show you just how much investigating I've done... ...through my line of logic! Argument -- Shi-Long Lang's Logic -- Lang: I've seen a lot of bodies like the one being carted off in my time. I can say he was shot in a single glance, but even you figured that much out, right? With your current gun laws, it's not exactly easy to get your hands on a gun. Not unless you're a member of law enforcement like Officer Meekins, isn't that right? Edgeworth: That is your reasoning...? Lang: Solid as a rock! It's based on the philosophy of detainment! Kay: Um... What's this \"philosophy of detainment\"? Lang: Hah! You don't know!? In that case, pay attention, girlie. In my country, the criminals have a saying: \"Beware of the wolf.\" Edgeworth: Why the wolf...? Lang: Because in my language, \"lang\" means \"wolf\", and you don't mess with me or my pack. And as for the detainment philosophy, its father is my honorable ancestor, Lang Zi. Edgeworth: (Hmm... You'd think I'd have heard of him and his teachings if he is [sic] that famous...) Lang: Lang Zi developed it as he worked to lock criminals away thousands of years ago. To this day, the Zheng Fa police still trains its recruits using his philosophies. Kay: But \"thousands of years ago\"? That makes your story about as believable as a fairy tale! Edgeworth: Hmph. Anything wears down and breaks over time. Do you really believe something as ancient as that can be applied to today's world? Lang: ......You want to put it to a test? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So what can you tell me about the body? Lang: A lot. Even without an autopsy, I have my eyes. They teach you the basics of forensics along with the detention philosophy. Edgeworth: Oh? Then you wouldn't mind telling me a little of what you've figured out, correct? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Yes, I think anyone who saw the bullet wounds would come to the same conclusion. Lang: Lang: Heh, don't pat yourself on the back yet! Edgeworth: What's that supposed to mean? Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Search where the water is deepest.\" You have to keep your eyes on the big fish that lurks in the depths, which is the killer. Edgeworth: Is that right? And what would you know about the killer? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It would appear you've studied a little of our laws. Lang: Studied? Who needs to study what every child on any street corner already knows? It's that... that......... Shih-na! Shih-na: The \"Federal Firearms Restriction Act\". Lang: That's it. The Federal Firearms Restriction Act. I hear it's not easy to get a gun these days. Edgeworth: (Interesting. That woman is the one in charge of keeping track of the information.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If that's the case, there are plenty of other officers who might be potential suspects. You're not seriously going to arrest each and every one of them, are you? Lang: As if I would need to! I've already looked into everyone else here. Edgeworth: Oh? Lang: Other than Officer Meekins. I know no one else's weapon has been fired. Edgeworth: ! H-How did you check every single person's weapon in such a short span of time!? Lang: That's because each and every one of my subordinates is extremely capable. It didn't take more than a few minutes to conduct the entire investigation! Edgeworth: (The power of sheer numbers...) But you have yet to check Officer Meekins's weapon, correct? Lang: Thanks for reminding me. Hey, you! Show me your gun. Meekins: ..................Oh! Edgeworth: (What's wrong...? Why does he look so sickly pale all of a sudden?) Meekins: ............Gun! Lang: What did you say? I can't hear you. Stop mumbling and spit it out already! Meekins: Sir, sir... I LOST MY GUN, SIIIIIIIIIIR!!! Edgeworth: How could you be so irresponsible!? Lang: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! In the end, it looks like you're still the only suspect we've got. You're the one who waited here outside this garage to ambush and kill the victim! Edgeworth: (So you think that Officer Meekins waited here to kill the victim, do you, Lang? I think this little accusation deserves a lot more scrutiny.) Add statement \"Officer Meekins ambushed the victim in this garage and killed him here with his gun!\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you are implying that the murder weapon in this case is a policeman's service revolver? Lang: I don't know for sure just yet, but it's entirely possible. After all, Officer Meekins did just admit that he \"lost his gun\". Ha ha ha ha! You'd think he could come up with a better lie than that! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean to tell me that the murder occurred here, in this garage? Lang: From the fact that the suspect was found almost next to where the body was found... ...I'd say that it's pretty obvious that this is the crime scene. Lang Zi says: \"A criminal always returns to the scene of the crime.\" Kay: Hey! Finally, a quote even I've heard of before! Lang: Furthermore, Lang Zi says: \"Successful investigations are the result of multiple returns to a crime scene.\" Edgeworth: (Looks like neither detectives nor criminals have changed their ways over the millenniums.) Edgeworth: (So this is the kind of conclusion the philosophy of detainment can lead you to...) Kay: I don't get it, Mr. Edgeworth. Why are you putting yourself on the line for Mr. Meekins? Edgeworth: It's not that I particularly care about what happens to Officer Meekins. Kay: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: However, I can't simply stand by while Agent Lang ignores our country's laws. (Shi-Long Lang... Just what sort of investigator are you?)Lang: I've seen a lot of bodies like the one being carted off in my time. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So what can you tell me about the body? Lang: A lot. Even without an autopsy, I have my eyes. They teach you the basics of forensics along with the detention philosophy. Edgeworth: Oh?

Edgeworth: Unfortunately for you, Agent Lang, that is simply not possible. Lang: What do you mean? Edgeworth: You've seen the crime scene for yourself. And while you were looking, did you not think to yourself that it was a little too clean? Lang: Aiya! Edgeworth: So you did notice that there was too little blood. Do you still wish to claim that Officer Meekins committed the murder here? Because this isn't the crime scene. And if it was your men who led you to think it was... ...then I suggest you leave this case to the local police to set the record straight! Lang: Grr! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Not bad. I see your logic can be just as sound as mine. In that case, let me ask you this: Don't you think it's weird that officer was hanging out around here in the first place? Edgeworth: Weird? How so? Lang: Hey, you! Your squad's not even supposed to be in this area, right? What were you doing neglecting your duties and loafing around here? Meekins: I-I...! Lang: Don't you dare give me some lame excuse like, \"I found myself taking a walk.\" Meekins: But sir... I really did take a walk, sir! Lang: You're a disgrace. How dare you take your pack obligations so lightly? Edgeworth: (Officer Meekins is looking extra meek. Is he hiding something...?) Meekins: Mr. Edgeworth! Please! Sir! Save me the way you did earlier, please, sir! Edgeworth: ...Officer Meekins. Please give is a detailed account of what happened. Meekins: SIR! Not you, too! Testimony -- Meekins's Testimony -- Meekins: It's true, sir! I wasn't assigned to this area, sir! I was told to check every square inch of the main gate area, sir! I also went looking for the kidnappers while selling dreams in the Blue Badgermobile, sir! But! I got completely caught up in my role, selling dreams to the children! SIR! Before I knew it, I found myself here in this area, sir! Edgeworth: What is this \"Blue Badgermobile\"? Meekins: It's a moving store on wheels that sells sweet dreams and merchandise, sir! Kay: So the Blue Badgermobile is just a roaming souvenir shop? Blue Badgermobile data jotted down in my Organizer. Meekins: SIR! I swear I was chasing the kidnappers down while I was being a good dream merchant! Edgeworth: (He seems rather worked up... Even more than his usual hyperactive self.) Kay: He sure seems sure of what he's saying. Edgeworth: Can you try to calm down and lower your voice to a more reasonable level, Officer? Meekins: SIR! Roger, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Alright then, where were you assigned to? Meekins: I-I was assigned to the main gate, sir! Edgeworth: (He must mean the area with the bridge and the outrageous fountain.) Kay: OK, then why are you here in the Wild, Wild West area? Meekins: That's because! It's because of a very deep reason, ma'am! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Describe for me how you conducted your investigation. Meekins: Yes, sir! Well! First, I made sure there were no suspicious-looking people in the area, sir! But! The only people that seemed to gather around me... ...were little girls, sir! Kay: Well, what did you expect when you're dressed like the Blue Badger? Meekins: I thought I had no choice at that point, sir, so... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What exactly do you mean by \"selling dreams\"? Meekins: SIR! The Blue Badgermobile is where dreams are collected! Kay: Um, what? Meekins: Sweetness like you've never known except in dreams, ma'am, like \"Innocence Drops\". And bitterness found only in nightmares, ma'am, like \"Guilty Jawbreakers\". Selling those as I pushed the Blue Badgermobile along is my sworn duty, ma'am! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You completely forgot to look for the kidnappers? Meekins: NO, SIR! OF COURSE NOT, SIR! I! I would never do something like that, sir! Edgeworth: .................. Meekins: ..................Umm... You're absolutely riiiiiiiight! Kay: Wow, you're good at this forcing-people-to-confess thing, Mr. Edgeworth! Meekins: To be frank, I'm just a little man, sir... I'm better at selling kids a few small dreams than looking for a big crook, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Enough wallowing in your own self-pity. Let's return to your testimony. Meekins: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did you wind up all the way over here? Meekins: I was in the middle of a sea of kids, sir... But one of the kids decided to challenge me to a fight, sir! I had to run away from the child's painful dropkicks, and before I knew it... Kay: Ha ha, the good ol' dropkick! I dished out my fair share of those when I was a kid! It was always the best when you felt one really connect with your opponent! Edgeworth: In any case, you wound up here for a reason completely unrelated to the investigation? Meekins: SIR! That's right, sir! Edgeworth: ...That's not something you should be admitting to with your head held high, Officer. Edgeworth: (It sounds like he simply forgot about his real job and became the Blue Badger... However, there is one flaw in Officer Meekins's story.

Edgeworth: (...It's time.) Gumshoe: Don't worry, Mr. Edgeworth! I'll be following your every movement with my binoculars! Edgeworth: Good to hear. Now make sure you don't lose sight of me. I'm counting on you for backup. Gumshoe: You can count on me, sir! Edgeworth: I have to go. The kidnapper is supposed to contact me soon. (Who would've thought that upon my return, I'd be thrust into a kidnapping case. And that I would be the one who would have to make the ransom drop-off...) Edgeworth: (Let's see... I checked that the money is all there, safe inside this suitcase... Now all I have to do is await further instructions from the kidnapper... ...which I'm expecting to be transferred to my cell phone. I wonder who else is around? This is the meeting place, after all...) ???: Welcome to Gatewater Land! Edgeworth: Hm? Oh, thank you. ???: And a big hello to you! I'm the Proto Badger! Nice to meet you! ............ Edgeworth: ............ Proto B.: Excuse me, but were you perhaps thinking of taking a picture of me? Edgeworth: A picture...? Of you...? Sorry, but I'm not interested. Proto B.: Aww, that's too bad. Well, have a good day! Edgeworth: ...Hello? ???: ...Who aRE yOu? YoU'Re nOt ERNesT AmaNo! Edgeworth: (It sounds like the kidnapper is using some sort of voice alteration device...) I'm his representative, Miles Edgeworth. ???: ...ARE YoU a cOP? Edgeworth: No, I'm......... a prosecutor. ???: ............ Edgeworth: ............ I know what you're wondering, and yes, I have brought the ransom money with me. ???: I SeE... In THAt caSe, bRIng thE mOnEy wiTh You to tHe StaDIum. Edgeworth: (So this person intends to see if I'm being followed, huh. Please, Detective Gumshoe... I really need you to come through for me this one time.) Edgeworth: ...Edgeworth speaking. ???: NeXT, ComE to THe HaUNteD HOUsE. Edgeworth: And just how long do you intend to have me wander around for? ???: ThAt'S fOr mE To dECIdE. YoU dON't hAVE MucH of A cHOIce hERe, mY fRIeNd. Edgeworth: I suppose not. Edgeworth: ...I've arrived. ???: ...Go iNsIDe. Edgeworth: (Hmph. What a dismal place...) ???: ThaT'S IT. GO thROuGh tHOsE DooRs... Edgeworth: (Am I being watched from somewhere?) ???: LeAVe tHe MoNEy aND GO. NoW. Edgeworth: Nnngh............ .................. (I was hoping for an exchange, but maybe I should do as they say for now and not push it.) Edgeworth: (I couldn't catch even a glimpse of the kidnapper. Perhaps I should keep an eye on this haunted house until police backup arrives.) Edgeworth: (Agh! It was a trap!) March 13, 11:23 AM ???????????? Examine evidence Prosecutor's Badge Front of badge Edgeworth: This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so. Back of badge Edgeworth: Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else! ???: That guy... betrayed... ???: No... can't be... Then the deal... Edgeworth: (Who is that...? And what are they talking about...?) ???: ...split... police... ???: ...Alright... ???: ...in front of... meet up... Edgeworth: (...I can't move my body... ...I-I fear I may faint again...) Edgeworth: Where am I...? (How long was I out...? It wasn't raining like it is now when I made the drop-off... This was supposed to be a simple affair... ...so why have I been taken hostage as well!? I can only assume Detective Gumshoe lost sight of me at some point.) Edgeworth: The only reason I agreed to be the drop-off man was because of that phone call. It was from Mr. Ernest Amano, the director of the powerful zaibatsu, the Amano Group. But aside from that, I also owe him a great debt of gratitude. His only son, Lance, had been kidnapped. I know that Lance is already in his twenties, but I guess some things you never grow out of. Edgeworth: .................. (I can't sit around waiting for someone to come help me! I must escape somehow...) ...Nnnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!! ???: Hahaha! Was that you making that funny sound!? Edgeworth: ............Who's there!? And how dare you laugh at a gentleman's plight!? ...Who are you? Are you one of the kidnappers? ???: A kidnapper? Me? No way! I'm not into such petty crimes. Nope! I'm after something much, much bigger! Edgeworth: .................. (Argh! I must be worn out from today's ordeal. Focus, Miles!) ???: Oh, I forgot to introduce myself! Sorry about that! Ahem! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: Great Thief? (And did she really just claim to be the Yatagarasu?) Kay: Oh, but my real name is Kay Faraday. You can call me \"Kay\", 'kay!? Good! Glad that's settled! Edgeworth: .................. Not quite. I have a mountain of questions for you... ...but first, if you would be so kind as to remove these ropes. Kay: Hmm... I wonder... Should I remove them? I was actually having a lot of fun watching you make those silly faces... Edgeworth: .................. Kay: Hey! There's no need to get all mad and icy glare-y on me, you know! This rope goes through here, and... there you go! Edgeworth: What a relief. I owe you my thanks. Kay: Ah, it's OK. You can pay me back in full later! Edgeworth: (Now then... What question should I start with? Unfortunately, I can already tell nothing is going to be easy with this cheeky girl...) Talk Great Thief Edgeworth: You call yourself a Great Thief, yet are you really a thief at all? Kay: You doubt me? I get it! You think that a young lady like me couldn't possibly be such a big-time thief, right? Edgeworth: (That's... not the part I have a tough time believing...) Kay: I am the real, genuine Yatagarasu, you know. Yup! I'm a pure-blooded Great Thief! It's a little something I inherited from my predecessor. Edgeworth: In that case... you wouldn't mind if I arrested you then, right? Kay: What!? Of course I'd mind! I haven't stolen anything yet! Seriously, I don't know how you can (changed from [can you] in the original release, correcting the typo) say such a horrible thing to your savior! Edgeworth: (That's true. Technically, she hasn't stolen anything in front of me... yet.) Yatagarasu (appears after \"Great Thief\") Edgeworth: When you say you're the \"Yatagarasu\", do you mean you are THE Yatagarasu...? Kay: Yup! The most righteous of the righteous! The legendary Great Thief! But I inherited the title only recently (changed from [the title was only recently succeeded to me] in the original release)... ...so I haven't had a chance to steal anything yet as the second Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: (I was not aware that thieves could pass down their titles like that...) Kay: But don't worry! I've got some big plans in the works! Edgeworth: Big plans, huh? They wouldn't happen to lead to a big arrest, would they? Kay: I knew it! There's just no reasoning with a prosecutor. Edgeworth: I'm not the problem here! Kay: I'll have you know that the Yatagarasu has no interest in stealing petty trinkets! There's one thing and only one thing I want to steal! Edgeworth: (Only one thing? And what would that be?) Kay: But that's going to have to wait until we find our way out of here! Edgeworth: Well, at least there is one thing we agree on. I'm sure I'll have plenty of time later to learn more about you. Present Anything Kay: Don't surprise me like that! I can't believe you're just shoving things in my face! I mean, aren't there more pressing things you'd rather ask little ol' me? Edgeworth: (She has a point... I should probably find out more about my mysterious savior first.) After clearing \"Yatagarasu\" Talk option: Kay: So, you never told me what your name is, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: Ah, I guess not. I'm Miles Edgeworth. Kay: Aha! Now I remember! Edgeworth: (...How can you \"remember\" something I just told you...? But she sure is cheery.) Kay: Alright, then Mr. Edgeworth, let's get outta here! ............Hm? Edgeworth: ...It would seem that we are locked in from the other side. Kay: What!? No way! I don't hear you! La la la! Edgeworth: Kay, you do remember where you came in from, right...? It looks like that might be our only way out of this room... Kay: Whoops, slight miscalculation. That's a good height to make an entrance from, but I can't jump that high to make an exit! Edgeworth: ...*sigh* I suppose we have no choice but to look around and see if we can't find another way out. Begin Investigation Isolation Room Talk Kay Faraday Present anything Kay: Hey! Don't you think getting out of here is more important right now!? You can ask me about that later! Edgeworth: (I suppose she's right...) Examine Cell phone Leads to: \"Hm? Isn't this my phone?\" Lockers Kay: Man! Why did they have to put the windows so high up, anyway!? How is a thief supposed to make her daring escape!? Edgeworth: I suppose we could make our way out if we were able to climb on top of these lockers. Kay: Haha! That's pretty clever! You'd make a good thief yet, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Please don't ever place my name and the word \"thief\" in the same sentence again. Kay: Let's see... I wonder if I can jump and grab the top of the locker here... Man! Why did they have to make such ginormous lockers, anyway!? Edgeworth: (Even if we wanted to use these lockers, we'd need some sort of foothold (Lockers - If we can get to the top, then we can escape. If only there were some footholds...)...) Boxes Kay: Hey! There's something inside the bottom-right box. Oh, I think it's a Pink Badger costume! Edgeworth: Pink Badger...? Kay: You don't keep up with what's going on in the world, do you? In that case, you'd better study up on the whole Badger clan with this! Edgeworth: What is this thing? Kay: Think of it as a bible of all the things you'll ever need to know about the clan! Edgeworth: (...Whatever. I suppose I can keep it as a reference guide or something.) Blue Badger Bible data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: I suppose this means that this is where they keep all the costumes? Kay: It certainly looks that way! It's like the Badger family's home! Edgeworth: (There are eight boxes, but seven of them are empty. Which means that seven of the costumes (Costumes - It seems that the costumes of the Badger family are kept in the Isolation Room.) are in use right now.) But aren't these Badgers the mascots of the police force? Kay: Well, I heard that the police had a hand in sponsoring this theme park. Probably because the Gatewater Group owes the police from all those cases they solved. Edgeworth: They have all the power of the state, and they used it to make a theme park!? Kay: It's not just any theme park! They have a handcuff-shaped, double-looping roller coaster... Edgeworth: That's quite enough. I'm feeling woozy from just the thought of such a thing. (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Key Edgeworth: And what have we here...? Kay: Ah! .................. Edgeworth: (Why do I feel a laser-like stare aimed right at me?) D-Did you want to take a look? Kay: Well, don't mind if I do! Ooh! I see! Yes, this is definitely...! A key (Tiny key - I may be able to open something, somewhere in this room with this key.)! I'm sure it's a key to something! Edgeworth: The \"something\" is what is relevant to my interest... Blue Badger boxes Kay: Look! It's the Blue Badger! Edgeworth: (I suppose even this thing can be popular with women.) Kay: My nemesis (changed from [I can't stand him] in the original release)! Edgeworth: Wh-What in the...!? (Why is she beating it (changed from [suddenly beating the Blue Badger's image] in the original release) up!?) Kay: He's got the word \"badge\" right in his name! That [sic] nothing but bad news for someone like me! (changed from [How bad is that for a girl like me!?] in the original release) And to think he's out there wandering around in this park... I'd better be careful, or he's going to arrest me by the power of his name alone! Edgeworth: (I somehow doubt that the Blue Badger has the power to arrest anyone.) Bad Badger boxes Edgeworth: So this is the Blue Badger's rival, the Bad Badger, huh. Do you feel some sort of reverence towards this Badger, Kay? Kay: ...Hah! I can't believe you would be so stereotypical when it comes to thieves! Surely you must also think there are much cooler, and cuter ones out there, right? That's it! I've decided that thieves and thievery need an image makeover! Edgeworth: (...Good luck with that one.) Proto Badger boxes Edgeworth: This is that Blue Badger I met at the main gate. Kay: Excuse me, but his name is \"Proto Badger\", not \"Blue Badger\"! He's based off of the very first design created by the local police chief. You know, when you compare the two, the Blue Badger looks a bit cuter! Edgeworth: I suppose as he continued to redesign him, the chief managed to make him cuter and cuter. Even humanity has come a long way when you think about how much we've evolved. Kay: Are we comparing the Blue Badger to humans now...? Pink Badger boxes Edgeworth: I suppose this is the Pink Badger? But since it has the same design, doesn't it seem forced to call this one a female? Kay: You think so? I mean, just look at how long her eyelashes are! Edgeworth: That's the only difference. Kay: And the fact that she's pink. Edgeworth: Yes, and? Kay: And her lips are red! See, lipstick! Edgeworth: .................. (What? She has nothing to say about the giant pink ribbon, or is that too obvious?) Boxes (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Boxes (subsequent times, after examining key) Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Beam Edgeworth: This is the beam I was tied to. ............ Kay: Hm? What's up? Edgeworth: I was pondering if perhaps we could make it over to and out the window if we climbed this. Kay: Good thinking! And if it's climbing action you need, just leave it to me! Edgeworth: Thanks. This little hook looks like it might make for a good foothold. Up you go, Kay, and good luck! Kay: Count on it! The Great Thief Yatagarasu spreads her mighty wings, and takes to the skies! Here I go! Kay: ............ Edgeworth: As I thought, this beam (The beam I was tied to - There is a hook on this beam, but it's not enough of a foothold to climb out with.) was definitely not made for climbing. Kay: What do you mean, \"As I thought\"!? I'm not your guinea pig, you know! Beam (subsequent times) Edgeworth: This is the beam I was tied to. ............ Just maybe, we can use this to climb up to and out the window. Kay: Leave it to me! ...............Wait. Didn't I just try this!? I can't climb this thing! Edgeworth: (I suppose we'll just have to find another way to escape.) Bad Badger head Edgeworth: What is this...? Kay: Looks like the Bad Badger, and it's looking as bad as ever! Edgeworth: Looks like a costume head to me. Kay: I guess the Bad Badger's costume is, at the very least, a two-piece, huh. Edgeworth: (The real question is, why is only the head sitting out here on the floor?) Bad Badger's Head data jotted down in my Organizer. Bad Badger head (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What is this...? Kay: Looks like the Bad Badger, and it's looking as bad as ever! Edgeworth: Looks like a costume head to me. Kay: I guess the Bad Badger's costume is, at the very least, a two-piece, huh. Edgeworth: (The real question is, why is only the head sitting out here on the floor?) Paint cans Kay: Maybe we can use this paint to help us escape... Edgeworth: And what exactly do you have in mind? Kay: Well, we could paint \"HELP\" in really giant letters! Edgeworth: And who, pray tell, would see these giant letters? We're inside a building. Kay: OK, then how about we light the paint on fire and send out colored smoke signals! Anyone who saw it would think some crazy arsonist was about, and call the cops! Hmm... Actually, that may not be all that great for me, seeing as I'm a thief and all. Edgeworth: ...Let's try to find something other than this paint to use, shall we? Photo rally sign Edgeworth: They're holding a Blue Badger photo rally? Kay: You didn't know? Plus, it's not just the Blue Badger, it's his whole family, too. If you manage to snap a shot of every member of the family, you get a really posh prize. Edgeworth: Well, there's a costume head sitting over there. Why not start with a picture of that? Kay: You can't do that! That's cheating! There's only one of each Badger in the park, so you have to work for it! Edgeworth: Speaking of Badgers, there was one sitting against a wall in the haunted house. Kay: Seriously? But somehow, I don't think that one counts, Mr. Edgeworth! You have to take pictures of the costumed ones walking around the park! Edgeworth: (Hmm... So these are the rules of this game? How quaint...) Badger Photo Rally data jotted down in my Organizer. Photo rally sign (subsequent times) Edgeworth: They're holding a Blue Badger photo rally? Kay: You didn't know? Plus, it's not just the Blue Badger, it's his whole family, too. If you manage to snap a shot of every member of the family, you get a really posh prize. Edgeworth: Well, there's a costume head sitting over there. Why not start with a picture of that? Kay: You can't do that! That's cheating! There's only one of each Badger in the park, so you have to work for it! Edgeworth: Speaking of Badgers, there was one sitting against a wall in the haunted house. Kay: Seriously? But somehow, I don't think that one counts, Mr. Edgeworth! You have to take pictures of the costumed ones walking around the park! Edgeworth: (Hmm... So these are the rules of this game? How quaint...) Door Edgeworth: Nnrgh... It seems that we won't be able to open this by ourselves. It also seems quite thick, so we can't just break it down. (There must be another way out of here.) Edgeworth: (Hm? Isn't this my phone? It looks like it made it through the ordeal intact.) Kay: If only there was [sic] a way for us to contact someone on the outside... Edgeworth: Ah, but we do have a way... right here. Kay: Ah! There was a cell phone here this whole time!? Edgeworth: If I'm right, Detective Gumshoe should have contacted the precinct for backup by now. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Are you OK!? I was so worried, sir! Edgeworth: I'm fine. I was knocked unconscious for a spell by the kidnapper, that's all. Gumshoe: I'm sorry, sir! I'm such a failure! If only I hadn't lost sight of you...! Edgeworth: Detective, we don't have time for this. Have the police set up a perimeter right now! Gumshoe: You don't have to worry about that, sir! I already got the boys working on that! But in doing that... I sorta... Aaaah...! Edgeworth: What's wrong, Detective? ???: ...Sorry to butt in, but I'm afraid you're going to have to make do (changed from [make due] in the original release, correcting the typo) with me. Edgeworth: Who is this? Lang: Shi-Long Lang of Interpol. A pleasure to speak with you, Mr. Edgeworth. I've heard a great deal about you. Edgeworth: So why exactly is an Interpol agent like yourself involved in a domestic kidnapping case? Lang: Don't sweat the details. A crime's a crime whether it's on a local or a global scale. Besides... ...you're the one who's in a world of trouble. Edgeworth: A-And why would you say that!? Lang: Lang Zi says: \"The pack that runs together, stays together.\" You catch my drift? You caused quite a ruckus by running blindly into a situation and then getting caught. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Lang: You should've contacted the police from the very beginning. Edgeworth: I'm sorry that this happened because of a lapse in judgement. However, I humbly request that you please help me out of here posthaste. Lang: ......Sorry, no can do. Edgeworth: What!? Lang: We're hunting the kidnapper now, and I haven't got any hands to spare. As I said, my pack moves as one. You're the one who wanted to go it alone, so good luck to you... Mr. Prosecutor. Oh, and once we do catch the kidnapper, rest assured we'll come find you... eventually. Edgeworth: ...You... You... Kay: What's wrong? Did you get cut off!? Edgeworth: No... My phone ran out of power. Kay: No way! Edgeworth: It doesn't matter anyway. We should try to get out of here through our own means. Kay: Yeah! I have a name to live up to, after all! If we put our heads together, we're sure to find a way out! Talk Kay Faraday The kidnapping (appears after examining cell phone, Bad Badger head, and photo rally sign) Edgeworth: Do you know where the person who kidnapped me went? Kay: Well, after they locked you up in here... ...it sounded like they went into the next room, and started talking to someone. Edgeworth: (I feel like I heard something as well, but it's all a haze in my mind. However, I do recall that the kidnapper was talking with someone... It was just a guess before, but I guess I really AM dealing with two kidnappers here.) Kay: After that, they left. It almost seemed as if they were done with you. Edgeworth: I suppose that is the case, as my kidnapping seems like an afterthought to the $1 million. Well, if they went into the next room, let's see what we can find out through the slot. Examine Door (after clearing \"The kidnapping\" Talk option) Kay: Ooh, we can peer into the room the kidnappers were in from there! Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Beam Edgeworth: There is a beam in the next room identical to the one in this room. There's even a hook on it to hold a propped-up floor panel in place. Which reminds me... Kay: Did you find something useful, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Hmm, perhaps. I may have found a very handy hint to how we'll get out of here. Hatch Edgeworth: Is that what I think it is? Kay: It looks like the kidnappers had an escape tunnel prepared just in case. That's awesome! They're like a bunch of Great Thieves themselves! Edgeworth: No, they're not, because I highly doubt they made the tunnel themselves. The floor panel was removed and propped up (Open floor panel - The panel is held in place by a hook. The entrance to an underground room perhaps?) against the beam in a very specific way. I think this building was originally built with a basement or underground area. Gray door Edgeworth: There's a door on the opposite side that appears to be the same as this one. Which would mean... ...that I can probably assume that these two rooms are very similar in structure. (I believe I may have just found our ticket out.) Door (subsequent times, after examining hatch) Kay: Ooh, we can peer into the room the kidnappers were in from there! Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Logic Connect \"Open floor panel\" and \"The beam I was tied to\" Leads to: \"This hook on this beam...\" Edgeworth: This hook on this beam... Kay: You know I already tried, and there's no way I can jump from this hook to the window! Come on, even you have to admit when something's just not possible. Edgeworth: Hah, I wasn't about to suggest that again. Rather, that it's here for a different purpose. Kay: Really!? Like what!? Edgeworth: As you saw in the adjacent room, it's clearly for keeping a floor panel propped up. Which means that there should be a panel in this room that we can open as well. Kay: Oh! I get it! Edgeworth: We didn't notice its existence all this time because it was being hidden by this tarp. Kay: Alright then! Let's fold this thing up and see what's underneath! Kay: Now THIS is what I call a treasure! Examine Closed hatch Kay: Wow, this must be another entrance to the secret, hidden basement! I totally smell treasure! Edgeworth: The scent I wish to smell is the sweet fragrance of freedom. Kay: Then what are you waiting for!? Hurry up and open the hatch! Edgeworth: Alright. .........Mmnph. This thing is locked down tight (Underground entrance - We might be able to escape through here, but the door is locked.). Kay: Aww! Fiddlesticks! Logic Connect \"Tiny key\" and \"Underground entrance\" Leads to: \"I believe you're up, Kay.\" Edgeworth: I believe you're up, Kay. Kay: Huh? Why me? Edgeworth: Because we need to use the tiny key that you've taken quite a liking to. Kay: Oh, gotcha! Just leave it to me! I love the tense feeling of these moments when you're about to uncover something big! Edgeworth: I believe the feeling of freedom would be much more satisfying right about now. Kay: Alright! I got the secret door open! And now...! Edgeworth: Ack! Wait! Kay: Wha--!? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: Are you alright!? Kay!? Kay: I'm fine. The ladder just slipped is all! Edgeworth: (Thank goodness she's alright. I about had a coronary...) Kay: There's a lot of really large machinery down here. Edgeworth: What about an exit? Kay: Umm... It's really dark and cramped down there, so I really doubt there's an exit. Argh, I can't believe that happened! Edgeworth: You have only yourself to blame for leaping before you looked, you know. Kay: No way! I mean, how was I supposed to know that the ladder is removable (Underground ladder - It looks as though it can be easily removed, but is it really safe to use...?)!? Examine Open hatch Edgeworth: (I finally got the door to the underground area open...) Kay, I just want to confirm with you that there wasn't an exit down there. Kay: Yeah, it was really cramped, and there was a lot of really large machinery. Edgeworth: I see. Are you hurt at all? Kay: I'm perfectly fine! I was just a little surprised when the ladder suddenly slipped out from under me... Edgeworth: (I wonder if this ladder can be put to some use...) Logic Connect \"Lockers\" and \"Underground ladder\" Leads to: \"I've figured out how we will escape this prison, Kay.\" Edgeworth: I've figured out how we will escape this prison, Kay. Kay: Oh? So, how are we going to bust out? Edgeworth: It seems that your reckless actions were of use after all. Kay: ...Are you actually praising me? Edgeworth: More of a \"thank you\" for giving me an idea regarding this ladder. Kay: The underground ladder? What about it? Edgeworth: This ladder isn't just for those who wish to go down... Kay: Oh! I see! If we use this...! Edgeworth: Yes, I believe it's long enough to reach the top of those lockers. Kay: Well, then what are we waiting for!? Investigation Complete Kay: Alright! Now we can get out of here! Edgeworth: Yes... We spent entirely too much time in here. (Kidnappers who held me hostage, and a mysterious Interpol agent... This case is only getting started, and I'll be the one to bring it to a resounding end!) March 13, 12:11 PM Wild, Wild West Area Edgeworth: It looks like it's stopped raining for now. Kay: Yeah, and thank goodness! You have no idea how hard it was raining earlier! ???: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm so glad to see you managed to escape, sir! I was so stressed that I thought my heart was gonna give out! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, may I ask what in the world that is? Gumshoe: Well, that's... um... MIB: Count off! 1! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 98! 99! MIB: Shifu! All 99 members are here and accounted for, sir! ???: Heh... What the heck do you think you're doing counting my cubs off like that!? Every person is a valuable human being, you get me? And everyone has a name that their parents gave to them. No one is a 2 or a 3... Everyone, regardless of age or rank, is number 1! Got it!? Shifu! Shifu! Edgeworth: ...You are Agent Lang, I take it? MIB: You infidel! How dare you address our Shifu so rudely!? Lang: Grr! Lang Zi says: \"A cub who disrespects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder.\" So don't you ever forget to show the proper respect towards another person! Shih-na. This isn't much, but please accept my card. Edgeworth: Oh, thank you. ...Please, accept mine in return. Lang: You all see that just now!? That is the proper way for two people to show their respect! Keep that in mind and you'll get far in life, got it!? Edgeworth: (Ah, that's right... Franziska did warn me... Something about an elite Interpol Agent from the Republic of Zheng Fa. Apparently, this man has the highest successful arrest rate in the organization.) Agent Lang, why exactly is an Interpol agent involved with this clearly domestic case? Lang: That's none of your business, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: How is it not!? Lang: I've heard a rumor or two about you. You solved a murder that occurred during your flight home recently, right? Hah! But you sure took a while just to arrest one little flight attendant. How pathetic. Gumshoe: H-How dare you say that about Mr. Edgeworth!? Are you saying you could've solved it faster, pal!? Lang: The comedic relief jumps to the aid (changed from [aide] in the original release) of his master... How cliché. Look, what I'm getting at is that if I had been there, no one would've died. Edgeworth: ! Lang: I would've solved the entire case and Agent Hicks would still be with us here today. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang knew yesterday's victim, Agent Akbey Hicks...?) Lang: Hicks was like a brother to me, so now, I'm out to take my revenge! Edgeworth: (Agent Hicks was investigating a smuggling ring with Franziska and a third person... This must be the man she was talking about.) In that case, you should understand how I feel, as the kidnapped is someone I know. So I ask that you please allow me to participate in the investigation... Lang: Lang: This isn't your neatly trimmed Courtroom of Eden, you know. You're out in the wilderness now, Mr. Prosecutor, and way out of your league. No hard feelings, but why don't you go on back to your courtroom now, pretty boy? Edgeworth: You...! You dare to mock the court!? Lang: I do... And I don't need the help of a filthy \"prosecutor\". Sorry, but the truth doesn't need the likes of you to distort it today! Edgeworth: (Who uses the adjective \"filthy\" to describe a prosecutor...!? And why...? Why do I feel such intense loathing emanating from him!?) Lang: Alright, men! Good job on the perimeter around Gatewater Land. Now just find me the kidnapper, and bring the punk to me! Dismissed! Sir! Lang: Now then, Mr. Prosecutor, you just sit tight here and don't cause any trouble, understand? Edgeworth: W-Wait! Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: It's been a while since I last met someone so disagreeable. (Why of all places did he show up here? And completely out of the blue at that! I suppose I'll have to ask Detective Gumshoe to fill me in on that.) Talk Kay Faraday Kay: Maaaan... I can't calmly do any stealing at all with that detective around. Edgeworth: I suppose it's not easy when there's this many members of law enforcement in the vicinity. Kay: It's alright! It's not like I'm in a hurry to steal just any ol' thing! Edgeworth: (...Which is it? Do you plan to steal something or not? Quite the mystery, this one. Maybe I should talk with her a bit more.) Talk Next step Kay: So what are you going to do about your investigation into the kidnapping? Edgeworth: Good question. Since Agent Lang holds the authority to investigate this case now... ...this makes things a bit more complicated. Kay: Oh, come on, you can't let that stop you! I'll even lend you a hand, so let's go! Edgeworth: But you're a self-purported \"Great Thief\", are you not? I don't believe I can let someone of an unlawful nature participate in an investigation. Kay: You don't like to listen, do you? I'm not just any ol' (changed from [ordinary] in the original release) Great Thief; I'm the Yatagarasu! And as I said earlier... ...the Yatagarasu is after one and only one thing. \"One and only one\" (appears after \"Next step\") Edgeworth: What is this \"one and only one\" thing you're after? Kay: The Yatagarasu is only interested in one thing... ...and that is the truth. Edgeworth: I see...  Edgeworth: It was seven years ago... There was a vigilante who threw the business world into a panic. Labeled \"mysterious\" and \"phantom-like\", the Yatagarasu appeared and vanished at will. Though we still don't know much about this thief's ultimate goal, we do know the targets. The Yatagarasu liked to find and publicly disclose (changed from [make public,] in the original release) evidence of corrupt dealings of all sorts. Once a target was chosen, no dramatic calling card or announcement was sent forth. Instead, the chosen corporation was infiltrated without even the target noticing. Some days later, the evidence that was found was sent out to the mass media... ...along with a card with the mark of a three-legged raven. Looking back, I suppose you could call what the Yatagarasu was stealing the \"truth\". (Could this child really be the successor to the original Yatagarasu? But that can't be... can it...?) Present Prosecutor's Badge Kay: If I had one of these, I could be a prosecutor, too, right? Edgeworth: Don't even think of stealing this from me. Kay: If it's that important to you, then why don't you wear it on your lapel? Edgeworth: (Why should I have to label myself as a prosecutor everywhere I go? And why does everyone ask that question of me? That's what I'D like to know.) Gatewater Land Pamphlet Kay: I really love theme parks! Too bad we're not here to have a fun time... Edgeworth: So why did you choose this one, and why choose to show yourself to me of all people? Kay: Because I was tailing you, silly! Duh! Edgeworth: You were following me!? (But why?) Blue Badger Bible Kay: It's a book of information about my arch-enemy, the Blue Badger. But I won't lose to the likes of him! You just wait and see. I'm going to write a \"Tome of Thievery\"! How's that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...The information that winds up on your wanted poster will suffice in this competition.) Badger Photo Rally Kay: Come on! The Badger family is waiting for us to find and take pictures of them! And remember, you have to yell, \"Badger GET!\" each time, or it doesn't count! Edgeworth: They even have a rule for when you take their pictures...? Kay: Tell me about it! I was planning to steal all of my shots, as any proper Great Thief should! Edgeworth: (Does the concept of stealing permeate every aspect of this girl's life...?) Anything else Kay: What do you think about this? Edgeworth: If you're going to steal anything, at least keep your hands off of my lines. Kay: Alright, alright. I'll return it to you. Here you go! Edgeworth: (I was hoping for some information in return, but my line will do for now.) Dick Gumshoe Edgeworth: Great job, Detective. Gumshoe: Sir! Edgeworth: For losing sight of me and the kidnapper, and allowing my investigation to be hijacked. Gumshoe: I... Sir...! Edgeworth: I look forward to your next month's salary assessment. Gumshoe: But... But the case isn't lost yet, sir! I'm gonna show you just how much of a man Dick Gumshoe can be! Edgeworth: Shall I prepare the 21-gun salute now or later? Talk Agent Lang Edgeworth: Detective, are you sure it was the precinct you called for backup? Gumshoe: O-Of course, sir! I think I would know the number to my own precinct like back of my hand! Edgeworth: Then why did an Interpol agent show up instead, with an army of his own agents? Gumshoe: That, I have no idea... About five minutes after I made the call, that wolf-man showed up out of nowhere, sir. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang definitely has an agenda, so the question is, \"What is he after?\") Next step (appears after \"Agent Lang\") Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! I was wondering if I may ask about one thing, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, what is it? Gumshoe: Um... Who is that? The girl over there, I mean. Kay: I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant, Kay Faraday! Gumshoe: Wh-Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: Funny, I don't recall making you my assistant, Kay... Gumshoe: Yeah! I'M Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! ME! It's been like that since... forever! Kay: Sorry, but I just stole your supporting role. Gumshoe: How can you say something so serious with that giant grin on your face, pal!? Mr. Edgeworth! We've got a thief on our hands, sir! She stole my role, sir! I'm taking her in, getting her convicted, and making sure she serves out her sentence! Kay: Oh, come on, it'll be fun! Like musical chairs! You'd better stay fast on your feet! Gumshoe: No way! I won't... I will not lose the spotlight to you, little girl! Present Prosecutor's Badge Gumshoe: If you're going to show me your Prosecutor's Badge, then I'll show you my police badge! Edgeworth: ...Your wallet is looking rather thin, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? Oh, whoops. I must've left my badge at home. I always get the two mixed up. Ha ha. Edgeworth: That's not a laughing matter, Detective! Gatewater Land Pamphlet Gumshoe: Gatewater Land... Who would have guessed this place would be such a success? But the Gatewater Group and I go way back, you know? Edgeworth: Yes... Same here. I handled two murder cases that took place at two of their hotels. And it was you who headed the investigation in each case. Gumshoe: Oh, I remember that, sir! I was 16 back then, standing in front of the hotel in the snow... Edgeworth: (...Clearly, we are not on the same page here.) Blue Badger Bible Gumshoe: You actually got a copy, Mr. Edgeworth!? Ooh! Can you show me the very last page!? Edgeworth: The last page? Very well... Let's see here... ...Interesting. Why is your name listed here under \"Special Thanks\"? Gumshoe: That's it, sir! You found it! Oh... Um... That's because I did the choreography for the \"Dance, Dance, Blue Badger\" song! Edgeworth: (I suspect that no one entrusts him with any real responsibilities at work...) Badger Photo Rally Gumshoe: Oh, are you participating in the photo rally, too, Mr. Edgeworth!? Um... I mean, I'm only doing it as part of my duties! Yeah. Edgeworth: ...I see. In that case, keep up the good work. So, how many have you found so far? Gumshoe: I've been sorta busy with the investigation, so I haven't really found any yet, but... Edgeworth: (Something tells me finding the Badgers isn't really a part of his duties.) Anything else Gumshoe: I'm sorry, sir! Absolutely nothing is coming to mind right now! As a man, the only thing I can attest to is this: \"To be a man, I, Dick Gumshoe, will tell no lie!\" Edgeworth: (His heart's in the right place... Now to work on his deduction skills.) Officers Edgeworth: Excuse me, but if you could just let me through here... Officer: Sorry, I can't let anyone through. Agent Lang's orders. Edgeworth: Nnngh... (I suppose I'll have to deal with this impasse for now.) Blue Badger Blue Badger: .................. Edgeworth: (That wriggling... I just can't bring myself to call it \"dancing\"...) Examine Barrels on left side Edgeworth: I highly doubt I'll find a clue in here, but I might as well check, just to be sure. ...Mnngh. This barrel sure is heavy. You there! Do you know what's inside of this thing? Officer: It's the emergency water supply for putting out fires. Edgeworth: ...I see. Well, they certainly are well prepared. Horizontal bar Edgeworth: This horizontal bar is used... for tying up horses. Apparently, you can ride real horses at the Cowboy's Ranch area just up ahead. Is it possible that the culprits have already escaped with the help of a stolen horse or two? Officer: Under Agent Lang's orders, we already rounded up all the horses... ...and every last one has been accounted for. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang is good, although, I won't go so far as to say I'm impressed just yet...) Rocking chair Edgeworth: It's an old-fashioned rocking chair, the kind that makes you feel instantly at ease. There's something written here... \"A soothing 10-minute sitting for only $100\"...!? I see. Reverse psychology. Make it so expensive that no one would dare sit on it... Barrels by cactus Edgeworth: It's an empty barrel. I'd venture to guess that its only purpose is to set the mood. Cactus Edgeworth: It's a cactus... and there's something written here on this sign... \"This cactus is a very gracious gift to Gatewater Land from the local police precinct.\" (I can't believe the police went so far as to even donate a cactus to this place.) Garage door Edgeworth: Horses are painted on this garage door to complete the Wild West theme. They almost look like they're ready to jump out into the real world and gallop away. ...Almost, being the key word. Tracks Edgeworth: Some sort of tracks were left in the mud here thanks to the rain. They look like tire tracks. Too bad they're destroying the Wild West atmosphere they worked so hard to create. (The tires on whatever made these probably got pretty muddy, as well.) After clearing all Talk options with Dick Gumshoe and Kay Faraday: ???: Laaaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, son!? Edgeworth: Mr. Amano? Ernest: Oh! Miles, my boy! I'm sorry to involve you in such an affair just after you've returned. Edgeworth: For you, Mr. Amano, I gladly offer my assistance. After all, I have you to thank for how well things turned out during my time abroad. If it wasn't [sic] for you, I might not have been introduced to that law office... ...and had the chance to study the inner workings of another country's judicial system. Ernest: No, no, no. Think nothing of it. As you know, Manfred and I go way back. I consider a beloved disciple of his to be like one of my own blood. Edgeworth: ............ Ernest: If you ever want to go overseas again, you need only to ask. I can use my company's vast network to send you anywhere at any time. Kay: So who's the old man? Edgeworth: He is the father of the currently kidnapped Lance Amano, Ernest Amano. Ernest: Now then, have you found Lance yet, Miles? Please... I miss my poor boy dearly! Edgeworth: I'm terribly sorry, but your son's whereabouts remain unknown, Mr. Amano. Ernest: Wh-- Hold on there! Then, what happened to all that money!? Edgeworth: .........I believe the $1 million has been stolen, and that the culprits are now on the run. Ernest: Whaaaaat!? Kay: Poor old man... Don't you have anything you could give him to cheer him up, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (Forgive me, Mr. Amano...) Talk Ernest Amano Talk The kidnapping Edgeworth: I was wondering if you could please tell me the details of the kidnapping one more time? Ernest: Oh. It was yesterday... A call came to the house. From the receiver came the sound of my son... \"Help me, Daddy!\"... *sniff* Edgeworth: I know this is tough, but please stay with me here, Mr. Amano... Ernest: You don't understand. He hasn't called me \"Daddy\" in ages... It was incredibly moving... I wish I had recorded him saying that. Edgeworth: (He definitely should have recorded that conversation... ...but not for the foolish sentimentalities of an old man.) Lance Amano Edgeworth: Refresh my memory, what kind of person is Lance again? Ernest: How will telling you about Lance help you get him back? Edgeworth: Surprisingly, a lot can be deduced from a person's relationships and behavior. Ernest: Very well, then. Lance is my one and only son, and he turned 21 this year. He is very much like me when I was his age -- kind and very attractive. I'm sure women simply can't keep their hands off of him. Edgeworth: Is there anything else about him you noticed of late? Ernest: Now that you mention it, I haven't been able to get in contact with our butler, Oliver. Edgeworth: Your butler...? Ernest: Yes, his name is Oliver Deacon. He's been with our family for years now. He gets along so well with Lance, so I thought maybe he would know where my son is... Oliver Deacon (appears after \"Lance Amano\") Edgeworth: Mr. Amano, could you please tell me a little more about your butler, Mr. Deacon? Ernest: As a butler, he's outstanding. He even serves as Lance's personal private tutor. He took a brief leave recently, but even after it was over, I haven't been able to reach him. Edgeworth: So you still haven't spoken with him since his leave? What about his family and friends? Ernest: They said they hadn't seen him. I've tried everything I could think of, Miles. ...Do you think this could have something to do with Lance's kidnapping? Edgeworth: It's possible, but I can't say anything for sure quite yet. (So even the person closest to the victim has gone missing... Oliver Deacon... Sounds like one name I had better keep in mind.) Present Prosecutor's Badge Ernest: Ah... Seeing that badge reminds me of Manfred. Now, HE was one fine prosecutor, the best of the best. Edgeworth: ...Yes, I can't disagree with you there. Ernest: Hmm... I sense that you don't really want to talk about him. Edgeworth: How I feel about him... It's hard for me to be truthful about that with another person. Ernest: Your hard countenance... I don't know what you're thinking or feeling... ...but mark my words, I think you are Manfred's true successor. I really do. Edgeworth: .................. Anything else Ernest: Ho, ho! That looks to be something with quite a bit of value. But then, all things have some value attached to them. Only by probing deep into the unknown can we become true winners in this world, Miles. Edgeworth: (Thanks, but knowledge isn't what's going to make me a winner here; it's information.) After clearing all Talk options with Ernest Amano: Edgeworth: .................. Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Let's begin our investigation. Even if that Interpol agent holds the authority to head this investigation... ...we can't allow ourselves to stand idly by, twiddling our thumbs. Gumshoe: I'm with you 100%, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! I, Dick Gumshoe, pledge to stick by your side through thick and thin! Edgeworth: Mr. Amano, it was my fault that the culprits escaped. Which is why, with your blessing, I vow to return Lance to you myself. Ernest: Oh! I've never seen you so passionate before, Miles. Good luck to you, my boy. Kay: Alright! Well, what are you waiting for!? Let's do some investigating! Gumshoe: If you think I'm losing to you, pal, forget it! Begin Investigation Wild, Wild West Area Gumshoe: So what should we examine first!? Edgeworth: Hmm... Thanks to Agent Lang, we can't leave this area. But the culprits were here until only very recently. Which means we may be able to find some clues that will tell us how they escaped. Gumshoe: OK! Let's get looking! Detective: Hey! You there! Gumshoe: Who, me!? Detective: What are you doing goofing off in a place like this!? Gumshoe: I wasn't goofing off! I was about to help Mr. Edgeworth kick off his investigation. Detective: You imbecile! All precinct detectives are now under Agent Lang's direct command! Gumshoe: N-No way! I am NOT working for Wolf-boy! Mr. Edgeworth! Can't you do something...!? Edgeworth: .................. I'm not exactly in a position to argue, seeing as how you ARE a member of the police. Detective: Good, now let's go! Gumshoe: Nooooooooooooooooooooooo!!! Detective: Boy, have I got just the job for someone of your talents! Kay: Well, that was exciting. Edgeworth: ............ Kay. Kay: What? Can't you tell I'm all ready to get down to some detective work!? Edgeworth: You should go home. Your parents must be worried about you. Kay: Oh, come on! I finally get to be your assistant and you try to ditch me!? Edgeworth: ...I don't recall offering you the position. Kay: Hmmmph. Why do you have to be so difficult? Besides, it's already too late, you know! Like I said, I've already stolen the position of \"assistant\" a while back! Edgeworth: Hah. You're the only one asserting that. Kay: Well! By the time anyone notices, it's already gone! That's the Yatagarasu way! Edgeworth: You shouldn't speak so lightly of things you know nothing about! Kay: Fine, whatever, you win. Go ahead and do your little investigation. But the talented assistant Kay, is going to tag along no matter what you say! Edgeworth: (Even if she turns out to be useless, she's not going to listen to me. I might as well surrender and let her come along for the ride...) Talk Blue Badger Blue Badger: .................. Kay: Hey! It's the Blue Badger! Badger GET! Edgeworth: (I really don't understand why she is so excited over this badger hunt. Speaking of Badgers, there's a person inside of there...) Mr. Badger, I wonder if you might share with me what you saw? Blue Badger: .................. Edgeworth: (He's doing that contorted wriggling \"dance\" again...) Kay: ............ Aha! ???: Aaaah! You've uncovered my undercover identity, sir! I was to remain under that head, sir! Edgeworth: ...Aren't you Officer Meekins? Meekins: SIR! Mike Meekins, reporting for duty, sir! Edgeworth: (This man was a witness in one of the cases I headed two years ago. About the only thing I remember about this officer is that... ...he often spoke and acted before he thought, which gave me a great deal of headaches.) Kay: Is he a friend of yours, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: I've met him in the courtroom once before. (Hmm... Why was he so upset when we unmasked him? Does he have something to hide?) Mike Meekins (after talking to Blue Badger) Talk Mike Meekins Edgeworth: Officer Meekins, why are you standing here wasting time? Meekins: SIR! Because I'm not a police officer right now, sir! I'm the Blue Badger! And I'm creating memories and dreams for the kids! That's never a waste of time, sir! I have a dream to become as big as Detective Gumshoe, sir! I was patrolling the scorchingly boring beat until a little while ago... ...when the dispatch radio on my shoulder crackled that the kidnappers had escaped, sir! I thought maybe this was my shot at making Detective, sir! I rushed on over to join in, but when I got here, there was a sea of people already... ...and I couldn't spread my trademark friendliness and joy on to anyone... Edgeworth: (It would seem that some people never change...) The Blue Badger Edgeworth: So why exactly are you in that ridiculous outfit? Meekins: Sir! That's because, sir! I'm here to keep the visitors in good spirits, sir! But it's also to hide the fact that I'm an officer on the trail of a kidnapper, sir! Edgeworth: I see. Agent Lang is very wise to employ this sort of diversionary tactics. Meekins: To be handed the role of THE Blue Badger out of all the different disguises, sir... It's... It's such an honor! Any clues? (appears after \"The Blue Badger\") Edgeworth: How long have you been standing here, Officer? Meekins: SIR! For about one little hour, sir! Edgeworth: (Hmm... That's around the time I woke up from being knocked unconscious...) Meekins: And I've been here even since, sir! Edgeworth: (If that's true, then it's possible Officer Meekins saw the kidnappers escaping!) Meekins: B-B-B-However, sir! I must tell you I didn't see a thiiiiiiing, sir!!! Edgeworth: I haven't asked you anything yet, Officer. Meekins: No no no no no! B-But I know you will, sir! Edgeworth: (He's hiding something from me.) Officer Meekins, I insist that you tell me more about your recent movements! Meekins: Sir! I've been playing the Blue Badger this whole time, sir! And getting into it, too! I patrolled the park, all while wearing this costume! And about one hour ago, I came over here, sir! I haven't seen any suspicious-looking people this whole time, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: What you said just now is contradictory to the facts. Kay: How so, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: This is what Officer Meekins's testimony contradicts! Present Badger Photo Rally Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Officer Meekins, let's back things up. I'd like to ask you about your last statement.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your testimony contradicts this piece of evidence! Meekins: I'm just a little patrolman, so I don't understand what you're talking about, sir! Kay: I can't say I get it, either. Edgeworth: (Gnnnrk! This isn't what I was looking for!) I'm sorry, Officer, but could you please repeat what you said one more time? Meekins: Of course, sir! I'd be honored to repeat myself as many times as needed, sir! For almost a whole little hour, I didn't see any suspicious-looking people around, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: As I thought, what you said just now is contradictory to the facts. Kay: OK, so what exactly is so contradictory, Mr. Edgeworth? Leads back to: \"This is what Officer Meekins's testimony contradicts!\" Edgeworth: Officer Meekins, let's back things up. I'd like to ask you about your last statement. Meekins: Sir! Of course, sir! If that's your wish, Mr. Prosecutor! This little patrolman will wait as long as I am commanded to wait! Edgeworth: You said that you saw a Blue Badger, correct? And yet, if you take a look at this, what you saw was not supposed to happen. This park is supposed to have only one of each Badger in it at any given time. Which means that as long as you are the Blue Badger, Officer Meekins... ...you should not have seen another Blue Badger wandering the premises! Meekins: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!? SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!? Kay: Then, that would mean that there are two Blue Badgers (A 2nd Blue Badger - There's only supposed to be 1 Blue Badger in the park, but a second was spotted.) walking around! But why!? Any clues? (subsequent times) Edgeworth: How long have you been standing here, Officer? Meekins: SIR! For about one little hour, sir! Edgeworth: (Hmm... That's around the time I woke up from being knocked unconscious...) Meekins: And I've been here even since, sir! Edgeworth: (If that's true, then it's possible Officer Meekins saw the kidnappers escaping!) Meekins: Yup, I've been hanging around in this area ever since then, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: And yet, if you take a look at this, what you saw was not supposed to happen. This park is supposed to have only one of each Badger in it at any given time. Which means that as long as you are the Blue Badger, Officer Meekins... ...you should not have seen another Blue Badger wandering the premises! Meekins: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!? SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!? Kay: But then, that would mean that there are two Blue Badgers walking around the park! Present Prosecutor's Badge Meekins: Sir! It's so incredibly shiny, but it has a really ugly shape! I knew it! I was right to go for the much more manly police badge, sir! But I lose it alot [sic], and I just know I'm going to lose it for real one of these days, sir! Kay: ...Mr. Edgeworth, I think this cop is one donut short of a baker's dozen. Edgeworth: I know. Believe me, I know. Blue Badger Bible Meekins: Sir! You have a copy of the Blue Badger Bible, too, sir!? That was written by experts on the Badger family, sir! And it's very, very thorough! It doesn't matter that I was made the Blue Badger only a little while ago, sir! That book helped me memorize every name of every Badger, sir! Edgeworth: (It's not that hard to remember four incredibly obvious names...) Badger Photo Rally Meekins: Drip, drop, little by little our privacy is being sold off to the public through this, sir! But that means I need to work extra hard on my cute poses! Kay: Ooh, like what? Meekins: Like thiiiiiiiiiiis! Kay: Great! Now I know what your new pose will beeeeeeeeeee! Look, sir! I've successfully stolen his pose and speaking styyyyyyyyyyyyyle, sir! Edgeworth: *sigh* That's nice, Kay. Anything else Meekins: Sir! I'm undercover as the Blue Badger now, sir! I must pretend to not know anything about anything, sir! Edgeworth: (I mustn't respond to that. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel...) Ernest Amano Present Stolen Costumes Ernest: Just what sort of operation is this, that they would allow their valuables to be stolen!? It's a disgrace to the way businesses are run everywhere! Edgeworth: Well, thieves, by nature. generally tend to target these types. Ernest: Stealing is an abominable behavior, don't you agree, little miss!? Kay: ...Y-Yeah, the worst! Edgeworth: (Am I going to have to add \"hypocrite\" to the list of things you are, missy?) Examine Barrels on left side Kay: Hah! I've got you now, you vile criminals! Edgeworth: ...I'd think the kidnappers would have better sense than to try hiding in these. Kay: Oh, come on! Lighten up, will ya? I was only joking! I don't REALLY think that the criminals would be hiding here, right in front of two officers! Edgeworth: ...I-I certainly hope not. Footprints Kay: Hey! There's a bunch of footprints in the mud over here! Edgeworth: I remember hearing rain fall out here while I was being held in there. Kay: Yup, it was just a passing rain. That's why the ground has already pretty much dried up. Edgeworth: I should be thankful. It left us with some nice footprint samples. Kay: You know what? I bet if we followed them, we can find out where the kidnappers went! Plus, we'd be able to spot them because of their muddy shoes! Edgeworth: ...I don't think it will be that easy. Kay: Why not? Edgeworth: Look carefully. There are quite a few different sets here. And we don't know which ones belong to the kidnappers. Kay: Oh, that's true... We don't know what kind of shoes (What kind of shoes? - If only we knew, we'd be able to track the kidnappers from the footprints.) they were wearing. Horizontal bar Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth, isn't this one of those things you tie horses to? Edgeworth: Yes, although the horses are in another location at the moment. Kay: Aww... And here I was hoping I would get to ride one. Edgeworth: You know how to ride a horse? Kay: Nope! Never rode one in my life! But I have an Asian friend who was born in the year of the horse! Edgeworth: (\"Non sequitur\" is the only way to describe your logic...) Barrels by cactus Kay: If these were real, I wonder what you'd put in them. Edgeworth: Water would be the obvious answer... Kay: But if you stored water in a barrel under the blazing hot sun, wouldn't it go bad? Edgeworth: People of that period probably didn't care about how it tasted. Kay: Sorry, but I can't let you get away with making fun of our forefathers! I mean, maybe they really liked the strange taste! Edgeworth: ...Look who's making fun of them now. Cactus Kay: Look! There's a blurb about the cactus here! \"This cactus is a very gracious gift to Gatewater Land from the local police precinct.\" Edgeworth: (I can't believe the police went so far as to even donate a cactus to this place.) Kay: So, is the police department running a cactus farm on the side? Ha ha, just kidding! They wouldn't do something so silly! Edgeworth: (Actually, I have the vague impression I've seen a cactus farm at the precinct before.) Garage door Edgeworth: Horses are painted on this garage door to complete the Wild West theme. Kay: They look so life-like, don't you think!? Edgeworth: Are you thinking of wrangling, or rather, stealing them? Kay: If you can coax them out of there, sure! Come on, I know you can sweet-talk them out! Edgeworth: I could be holding a cube of sugar in my hand and they wouldn't budge, Kay. Tracks Edgeworth: It's a set of tire tracks originating from the garage. Kay: Aha! So that means a car left from the garage at some time, right? Edgeworth: Correct. But for the car to leave these tracks... ...it would mean that it left during the passing rain. (That's the only explanation as to why these tracks are made of mud.) Hmm, three treads... I think we can also safely assume it's a special type of car. Logic Connect \"Costumes\" and \"A 2nd Blue Badger\" Edgeworth: A second Blue Badger that shouldn't exist... Clearly, the true identity of the person underneath is... Kay: Oh, I know! It's one of the kidnappers, right!? The person wore a costume to get away (Costumed escape - The identity of the second Blue Badger was probably the kidnapper in disguise.)! Edgeworth: Precisely. After all, the costumes that went missing from the storage area are... Kay: ...A Blue Badger, a Proto Badger, and a Bad Badger. Edgeworth: Yes, those three. Kay: So there are three phony Badgers running around in the park somewhere, huh! Stolen Costumes data jotted down in my Organizer. Connect \"What kind of shoes?\" and \"Costumed escape\" Leads to: \"Now that we know that the kidnappers were wearing Badger costumes...\" Partner Kay: Yes? Talk The kidnapping Edgeworth: Kay, what do you think about the kidnapping? Kay: Well, I don't know anything about the victim... ...so actually, I was hoping you could tell me. Edgeworth: Ah, that's right. I never did explain the situation to you. I got involved because of a phone call I received. It was from none other than the director of the Amano Group, Mr. Ernest Amano. His only son, Lance, had been kidnapped, and he wanted me to be the drop-off man. Little did I suspect that I would be abducted myself. Kay: And that's when I found you tied to a pole screaming, \"Nnnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!!\" Edgeworth: Can you please drop that already!? Present Prosecutor's Badge Kay: If I had one of these, I could be a prosecutor, too, right? Edgeworth: Don't even think of stealing this from me. Kay: If it's that important to you, then why don't you wear it on your lapel? Edgeworth: (I suppose I can't really tell her... ...that no one in the Prosecutor's Office wears their badges. But why does everyone ask that question of me? That's what I'D like to know.) Stolen Costumes Kay: Looks like there's another thief afoot! Edgeworth: Only if we assume that this is not your handiwork. Kay: Are you kidding!? You know that the Blue Badger is enemy number one to me! Can you imagine me ever being on good terms with that thing!? Edgeworth: .................. Actually, it's surprisingly easy. Edgeworth: Now that we know that the kidnappers were wearing Badger costumes... ...those footprints from earlier take on a new, and very significant meaning. Kay: Oh, you mean now we know which tracks belong to the kidnappers, right!? Edgeworth: Yes. More than shoe prints, we need to follow the paw prints of Badgers. Kay: OK, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to use those footprints and go Badger hunting! Examine Footprints Leads to: \"Hmm... So we're looking for footprints made by a costume...\" Kay: Hmm... So we're looking for footprints made by a costume... Hey! I think I found them! There are two sets here! Edgeworth: They both do look like possible candidates. Kay: This set is walking off to the west... Argh! It just stops! I can't make heads or tails of where it's headed from here! Edgeworth: I think we can assume it's headed towards the stadium... Kay: Hmm... I wonder where the other set leads? This one seems to be headed east... Huh? Quick, Mr. Edgeworth! I've got him! I got one of the culprits! Meekins: Aaaah! Nooooo! I'm not a kidnapper, sir!!! Edgeworth: Down, Kay. Clearly, those footprints belong to Officer Meekins. But our criminals were each wearing a costume. Kay: Aha! Maybe they came over to this garage for something? Edgeworth: That's what I would suppose. Officer Meekins, if you could step aside for a moment. We need to examine the garage. Meekins: SIR! Roger Wilco, sir! Examine Garage door Leads to: \"Let's open this shutter and see what we find.\" Footprints Edgeworth: There are two sets of prints that could be from the kidnappers... Kay: One set is headed off to the west... Edgeworth: To the stadium, I would suppose... Kay: And the other set heads to the east... Edgeworth: We should follow these prints to their conclusion and investigate the garage. Kay: OK! Edgeworth: Let's open this shutter and see what we find. Kay: Maybe we'll find the kidnappers hiding inside! Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Edgeworth: Wh-What in the--!? (We seem to have stumbled across a dead body...) Kay: ............ Edgeworth: (She must be in severe shock to have been the first to find it... Now then, who is this man?) Ernest: I-It's Oliver! Edgeworth: ! Mr. Amano, are you saying that this man is... Ernest: Yes... He's my butler... How could something like this have happened!? Edgeworth: (Indeed. And why was Mr. Deacon here to begin with? I'd better investigate this crime scene quickly, before Agent Lang or his men return. The kidnapper's footprints lead right to this garage... ...and right to a dead body. Is it possible one of the kidnappers is now a murder victim (Victim was kidnapper? - Following a kidnapper's prints led us to a body. Was the victim in a costume?)...?) From my cursory examination, I believe this man died of a fatal bullet wound. Preliminary Findings data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: You sure are calm for someone who just found a body. Edgeworth: (It's surprising what one can become accustomed to in the span of two days...) Leads to examination of body Talk Ernest Amano Edgeworth: Mr. Amano... This body... Ernest: Yes... That's my butler, Oliver... How could something like this have happened!? Edgeworth: (Indeed. And why was Mr. Deacon here to begin with?) Examine Footprints Edgeworth: There are two sets of prints that could be from the kidnappers... Kay: One set is headed off to the west... Edgeworth: To the stadium, I would suppose... Kay: And the other set heads to the east... Edgeworth: ...Right to the garage. (Do these prints belong to the victim we found inside the garage?) Rocking chair Kay: Ooh, did you know? I really love this kind of chair, the way it rocks back and forth! When I grow old, I plan to sit in one of these and rock the day away every day! But you don't have to wait, Mr. Edgeworth! You're at just the right age for one! Edgeworth: (Do I really project myself as someone of that age?) Blue Badgermobile Edgeworth: What a peculiar car... Kay: Yeah. From the look of it, it must be the Blue Badgermobile. And it has three tires... So maybe it left those tire tracks behind!? Edgeworth: *sigh* That's simply not possible. Kay: Huh? Why? Edgeworth: Take a look at the tires. There's no mud stuck to them. Therefore, it must have been here since before it started to rain. Kay: Oh, gotcha! Good eye! Edgeworth: (It's a shame I don't see any other clues around...) Body Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Examine Pendant Edgeworth: (This is an unusually-shaped pendant...) Kay: What is it? Is it something valuable? Edgeworth: (She seems to have regained some of her composure...) Kay: It looks like a horse pendant! It's got an antique feel about it, and it's really pretty... Hold on... This is made of platinum silver! Nice! It IS worth something after all! Ooh, and look! There's something written on the back. \"Colin Devorae\"... It's a name. Edgeworth: \"Colin Devorae\"...? (But this man's name is...) Wounds Edgeworth: (As long as that Interpol agent has control of this case... ...I'm not going to be able to have a real autopsy done on the victim. I'm no doctor, but let's see what I can piece together myself.) Hmm, there are two gunshot wounds one in his abdomen and one in his shoulder. Kay: So that means he was shot twice...? Edgeworth: No, I don't think so. I think the abdominal one is an entry wound, and the one near his shoulder is the exit wound. Kay: Nice! I knew you could figure it out! Edgeworth: It comes with experience, and I've seen my share of crime scenes. (Speaking of experience... ...this crime scene seems a bit too clean for a murder where the bullet went clean through. I should make a note of this oddity.) Preliminary Findings data updated in my Organizer. Wounds (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Hmm, there are two gunshot wounds one in his abdomen and one in his shoulder. Kay: So that means he was shot twice...? Edgeworth: No, I don't think so. I think the abdominal one is an entry wound, and the one near his shoulder is the exit wound. Kay: Nice! I knew you could figure it out! Edgeworth: It comes with experience, and I've seen my share of crime scenes. (Speaking of experience... ...this crime scene seems a bit too clean for a murder where the bullet went clean through. I should make a note of this oddity.) Deduce pendant (after examining pendant) Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Preliminary Findings Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's something not right about the name on the pendant. The victim is the Amano family butler, and his name is \"Oliver Deacon\". But the name on the pendant is \"Colin Devorae\". Kay: I wonder what's up with that? Edgeworth: I don't know, but... ...I think we've hit upon an important piece of information. Mr. Deacon's Pendant data jotted down in my Organizer. Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence alone solves this whole case! Kay: Really!? You think so!? Because to be honest, I don't really see how it solves anything... You must be confused jumping from a kidnapping to a murder. Yeah, that's it! Edgeworth: (Nngh! I can't believe I made such a large blunder... ...that even this little girl could point it out!) Leads back to examination of body Examine evidence Mr. Deacon's Pendant Front side Edgeworth: It's the victim's pendant, which is shaped like a horse. Kay: It's got a real dignified look on its face. That makes it worth all the more... ! Oh no, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What? Did you find an important piece of evidence? Kay: This... is made of platinum silver! That makes this thing super-valuable! I've seen this type of jewelry at a lot of stores before, so I know it when I see it! Edgeworth: ............Kay, if you ever laid so much as a finger on those pieces of jewelry... Kay: Wh-What? Me? I-I'd never do something like that! Edgeworth: (......Is it possible that she has never wanted to steal from a jewelry store before?) Name on back Edgeworth: The name \"Colin Devorae\" is engraved here. Kay: I really admire people who carve their own names into a pendant. Edgeworth: Oh? And why would that be? Kay: You have no imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. Did you ever think that maybe people want to have their loved ones always nearby? Edgeworth: It's not as if I have a wedding band, and I have no interest in accessorizing. Kay: *sigh* I suppose. Anyway, you know what? More than wearing flashy accessories... ...I'd rather be engraving my name into every treasure I can find all around the world! Edgeworth: (A sign of affection is one thing, but blatant vandalizing is just a bit different.) Partner Talk The murder Edgeworth: It appears that this case has taken a turn for the unexpected. Kay: I'll say! I was shocked to open that shutter and find a dead body inside! Edgeworth: I suppose most people would be, since the average person rarely runs across a corpse. Kay: Wait! You just compared me to a \"normal person\", didn't you!? I'll have you know that I'm... Edgeworth: Sorry. I suppose I should have recognized that you're a... thief, correct? Kay: No! I'm a GREAT Thief! And a GREAT Thief is not surprised by anything! Got it!? Edgeworth: (Apparently, with GREAT thievery comes GREAT loss of short-term memory.) Present Mr. Deacon's Pendant Kay: This horse is really pretty... Edgeworth: Don't even think about it. Kay: OK, I'll just hold onto it then! Don't worry, it's safe with me! Edgeworth: (Just so we're clear, Kay, a five-finger discount is not part of the bargain.) After examining wounds and correctly deducing pendant: Investigation Complete ???: Laaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, sweetie!? Edgeworth: Excuse me, but you are...? ???: *ba-dump* Edgeworth: ? ???: Oh, this is bad... He's really good looking! Ack! Stop it, Lauren! You can't let yourself fall for a playboy like him! You're in love with... Kay: Sounds like someone doesn't know the meaning of the phrase \"inner monologue\", huh? Edgeworth: Sorry to interrupt your... conversation, but might you be a friend of Lance? ???: Yes, I'm Lance's girlfriend... My name is Lauren Paups. Edgeworth: His girlfriend...? Paups: Oh, it's not like that! We're more like friends... and, um... We're not lovers or anything! We! Well, we haven't gotten that far yet! But... I guess that's how people are going to see it, so I should just accept it... I even got this ring as a present from Lance... *swoon* Kay: Ha ha, you know what she reminds of? A cartoon character! Edgeworth: N...Nnnnrrrghn... May I inquire as to why you are here? Paups: I haven't been able to get in contact with Lance lately... ...and I began to get really worried. *sob* I looked everywhere for him, and then I heard about the kidnapping, so I came here. Kay: Wow, you're really strong for having made it through all this by yourself! Paups: Um! Is it true!? Has Lance really been kidnapped!? Edgeworth: ...No one is supposed to know, but yes, it's true. Paups: Oh, Lance...! I can't believe you've been spirited away... I wonder how you're doing right now... Kay: Looks like she's gone back to the \"fair maiden in love\" routine... So, Mr. Edgeworth, where do we go from here? Edgeworth: Well, we found a body, so we should look into the murder... ???: Lang: My men brought me up to speed over the radio. And I have to say, you really should've called. I heard you found something very intriguing. Edgeworth: I have nothing to hide, Agent Lang. It's exactly what you see before you. Lang: I'll take it from here. Yeah, that guy's really dead. Hey! You waiting for an invitation? Hurry up and detain the suspect, now. Edgeworth: (Suspect? Who...?) Lang: Officer Meekins, is it? You're coming with us. Meekins: What!? SIR! I had nothing to do with it, sir! Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Don't you think you're being a bit rash!? Do you even have a good reason to suspect Officer Meekins!? Lang: Hah, I leave that kind of stuff to you prosecutors. It's your job, after all. Like I said earlier, the crime scene isn't as forgiving as your precious courtroom. Edgeworth: That's your answer!? Lang: I know you like your logic and reasoning... ...but that sort of impractical fluff is not needed out here in the field. Edgeworth: ! Lang: All you have to do is arrest suspicious person after suspicious person. That's how you eliminate crime from the streets! Edgeworth: But that's also precisely how you unnecessarily arrest innocent people by mistake! Lang: \"Innocent people\"? Nonsense! There's no such thing as an innocent person. We've all got a blemish or two in our hearts. Edgeworth: That's tyranny! I won't allow such a thing to go on unchecked before my eyes! Lang: Heh! Too bad you don't call the shots around here! Edgeworth: As I have sworn to uphold the laws of this land, I cannot allow you to take this man in. That you would arrest a man on false charges without even conducting an investigation... ...have you no honor as a member of law enforcement!? MIB: You! How dare you speak so disrespectfully to our Shifu!? Lang: Hold it! .................. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You amuse me, Mr. Prosecutor. Lang Zi says: \"Every pack has its own rules.\" If you can play by their rules and come out on top, that is a true victory. Alright, I'll give your beloved laws a fair shake. I'll show you just how much investigating I've done... ...through my line of logic! Argument -- Shi-Long Lang's Logic -- Lang: I've seen a lot of bodies like the one being carted off in my time. I can say he was shot in a single glance, but even you figured that much out, right? With your current gun laws, it's not exactly easy to get your hands on a gun. Not unless you're a member of law enforcement like Officer Meekins, isn't that right? Edgeworth: That is your reasoning...? Lang: Solid as a rock! It's based on the philosophy of detainment! Kay: Um... What's this \"philosophy of detainment\"? Lang: Hah! You don't know!? In that case, pay attention, girlie. In my country, the criminals have a saying: \"Beware of the wolf.\" Edgeworth: Why the wolf...? Lang: Because in my language, \"lang\" means \"wolf\", and you don't mess with me or my pack. And as for the detainment philosophy, its father is my honorable ancestor, Lang Zi. Edgeworth: (Hmm... You'd think I'd have heard of him and his teachings if he is [sic] that famous...) Lang: Lang Zi developed it as he worked to lock criminals away thousands of years ago. To this day, the Zheng Fa police still trains its recruits using his philosophies. Kay: But \"thousands of years ago\"? That makes your story about as believable as a fairy tale! Edgeworth: Hmph. Anything wears down and breaks over time. Do you really believe something as ancient as that can be applied to today's world? Lang: ......You want to put it to a test? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So what can you tell me about the body? Lang: A lot. Even without an autopsy, I have my eyes. They teach you the basics of forensics along with the detention philosophy. Edgeworth: Oh? Then you wouldn't mind telling me a little of what you've figured out, correct? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Yes, I think anyone who saw the bullet wounds would come to the same conclusion. Lang: Lang: Heh, don't pat yourself on the back yet! Edgeworth: What's that supposed to mean? Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Search where the water is deepest.\" You have to keep your eyes on the big fish that lurks in the depths, which is the killer. Edgeworth: Is that right? And what would you know about the killer? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It would appear you've studied a little of our laws. Lang: Studied? Who needs to study what every child on any street corner already knows? It's that... that......... Shih-na! Shih-na: The \"Federal Firearms Restriction Act\". Lang: That's it. The Federal Firearms Restriction Act. I hear it's not easy to get a gun these days. Edgeworth: (Interesting. That woman is the one in charge of keeping track of the information.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If that's the case, there are plenty of other officers who might be potential suspects. You're not seriously going to arrest each and every one of them, are you? Lang: As if I would need to! I've already looked into everyone else here. Edgeworth: Oh? Lang: Other than Officer Meekins. I know no one else's weapon has been fired. Edgeworth: ! H-How did you check every single person's weapon in such a short span of time!? Lang: That's because each and every one of my subordinates is extremely capable. It didn't take more than a few minutes to conduct the entire investigation! Edgeworth: (The power of sheer numbers...) But you have yet to check Officer Meekins's weapon, correct? Lang: Thanks for reminding me. Hey, you! Show me your gun. Meekins: ..................Oh! Edgeworth: (What's wrong...? Why does he look so sickly pale all of a sudden?) Meekins: ............Gun! Lang: What did you say? I can't hear you. Stop mumbling and spit it out already! Meekins: Sir, sir... I LOST MY GUN, SIIIIIIIIIIR!!! Edgeworth: How could you be so irresponsible!? Lang: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! In the end, it looks like you're still the only suspect we've got. You're the one who waited here outside this garage to ambush and kill the victim! Edgeworth: (So you think that Officer Meekins waited here to kill the victim, do you, Lang? I think this little accusation deserves a lot more scrutiny.) Add statement \"Officer Meekins ambushed the victim in this garage and killed him here with his gun!\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you are implying that the murder weapon in this case is a policeman's service revolver? Lang: I don't know for sure just yet, but it's entirely possible. After all, Officer Meekins did just admit that he \"lost his gun\". Ha ha ha ha! You'd think he could come up with a better lie than that! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean to tell me that the murder occurred here, in this garage? Lang: From the fact that the suspect was found almost next to where the body was found... ...I'd say that it's pretty obvious that this is the crime scene. Lang Zi says: \"A criminal always returns to the scene of the crime.\" Kay: Hey! Finally, a quote even I've heard of before! Lang: Furthermore, Lang Zi says: \"Successful investigations are the result of multiple returns to a crime scene.\" Edgeworth: (Looks like neither detectives nor criminals have changed their ways over the millenniums.) Edgeworth: (So this is the kind of conclusion the philosophy of detainment can lead you to...) Kay: I don't get it, Mr. Edgeworth. Why are you putting yourself on the line for Mr. Meekins? Edgeworth: It's not that I particularly care about what happens to Officer Meekins. Kay: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: However, I can't simply stand by while Agent Lang ignores our country's laws. (Shi-Long Lang... Just what sort of investigator are you?)Lang: I've seen a lot of bodies like the one being carted off in my time. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So what can you tell me about the body? Lang: A lot. Even without an autopsy, I have my eyes. They teach you the basics of forensics along with the detention philosophy. Edgeworth: Oh?

And while you were looking, did you not think to yourself that it was a little too clean? Lang: Aiya! Edgeworth: So you did notice that there was too little blood. Do you still wish to claim that Officer Meekins committed the murder here? Because this isn't the crime scene. And if it was your men who led you to think it was... ...then I suggest you leave this case to the local police to set the record straight! Lang: Grr! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Not bad. I see your logic can be just as sound as mine. In that case, let me ask you this: Don't you think it's weird that officer was hanging out around here in the first place? Edgeworth: Weird? How so? Lang: Hey, you! Your squad's not even supposed to be in this area, right? What were you doing neglecting your duties and loafing around here? Meekins: I-I...! Lang: Don't you dare give me some lame excuse like, \"I found myself taking a walk.\" Meekins: But sir... I really did take a walk, sir! Lang: You're a disgrace. How dare you take your pack obligations so lightly? Edgeworth: (Officer Meekins is looking extra meek. Is he hiding something...?) Meekins: Mr. Edgeworth! Please! Sir! Save me the way you did earlier, please, sir! Edgeworth: ...Officer Meekins. Please give is a detailed account of what happened. Meekins: SIR! Not you, too! Testimony -- Meekins's Testimony -- Meekins: It's true, sir! I wasn't assigned to this area, sir! I was told to check every square inch of the main gate area, sir! I also went looking for the kidnappers while selling dreams in the Blue Badgermobile, sir! But! I got completely caught up in my role, selling dreams to the children! SIR! Before I knew it, I found myself here in this area, sir! Edgeworth: What is this \"Blue Badgermobile\"? Meekins: It's a moving store on wheels that sells sweet dreams and merchandise, sir! Kay: So the Blue Badgermobile is just a roaming souvenir shop? Blue Badgermobile data jotted down in my Organizer. Meekins: SIR! I swear I was chasing the kidnappers down while I was being a good dream merchant! Edgeworth: (He seems rather worked up... Even more than his usual hyperactive self.) Kay: He sure seems sure of what he's saying. Edgeworth: Can you try to calm down and lower your voice to a more reasonable level, Officer? Meekins: SIR! Roger, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Alright then, where were you assigned to? Meekins: I-I was assigned to the main gate, sir! Edgeworth: (He must mean the area with the bridge and the outrageous fountain.) Kay: OK, then why are you here in the Wild, Wild West area? Meekins: That's because! It's because of a very deep reason, ma'am! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Describe for me how you conducted your investigation. Meekins: Yes, sir! Well! First, I made sure there were no suspicious-looking people in the area, sir! But! The only people that seemed to gather around me... ...were little girls, sir! Kay: Well, what did you expect when you're dressed like the Blue Badger? Meekins: I thought I had no choice at that point, sir, so... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What exactly do you mean by \"selling dreams\"? Meekins: SIR! The Blue Badgermobile is where dreams are collected! Kay: Um, what? Meekins: Sweetness like you've never known except in dreams, ma'am, like \"Innocence Drops\". And bitterness found only in nightmares, ma'am, like \"Guilty Jawbreakers\". Selling those as I pushed the Blue Badgermobile along is my sworn duty, ma'am! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You completely forgot to look for the kidnappers? Meekins: NO, SIR! OF COURSE NOT, SIR! I! I would never do something like that, sir! Edgeworth: .................. Meekins: ..................Umm... You're absolutely riiiiiiiight! Kay: Wow, you're good at this forcing-people-to-confess thing, Mr. Edgeworth! Meekins: To be frank, I'm just a little man, sir... I'm better at selling kids a few small dreams than looking for a big crook, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Enough wallowing in your own self-pity. Let's return to your testimony. Meekins: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did you wind up all the way over here? Meekins: I was in the middle of a sea of kids, sir... But one of the kids decided to challenge me to a fight, sir! I had to run away from the child's painful dropkicks, and before I knew it... Kay: Ha ha, the good ol' dropkick! I dished out my fair share of those when I was a kid! It was always the best when you felt one really connect with your opponent! Edgeworth: In any case, you wound up here for a reason completely unrelated to the investigation? Meekins: SIR! That's right, sir! Edgeworth: ...That's not something you should be admitting to with your head held high, Officer. Edgeworth: (It sounds like he simply forgot about his real job and became the Blue Badger... However, there is one flaw in Officer Meekins's story. But I have the feeling that he'll need some prodding before he'll spill the beans.)Oldbag: I came to this stadium to take a short break. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean you took a break from being the Pink Badger? Oldbag: You may not think it, but it's hard work keeping kids' dreams alive. You smell of sweat, your hip creaks with pain -- you even begin to dream about work. Kay: That's the kind of story that would scar a child for life, you know... Oldbag: Well, that's why I chose to come take my break here, whippersnapper! I don't plan on playing the part of the Dead Badger in front of a bunch of kids! Edgeworth: So what did you see while you, the Pink Badger, were resting? Oldbag: Oh, yes, that! Well! Oldbag: As I was resting, I happened to glance over and I saw two men facing each other in that area. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You saw two men...? Can you describe them for me? Oldbag: They looked like your average Joes, completely uninteresting and not worth fawning over. I'm telling you, they were so boring that I don't even remember much beyond that. Edgeworth: But did they have any special features? Anything you can recall would be very helpful. Oldbag: Oh, my! Don't tell me you're jealous of those two men! Kay: Hey, she's right. You do seem pretty worked-up over them, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: I-I'm not worked up over anyone! A-And I'm not jealous! Oldbag: It's alright, Edgey-poo. Those two were just foals compared to a stallion like you. I thought so little of them that I lost interest the instant I laid eyes on them. Oldbag: Suddenly, there was a loud gunshot, and the person who was shot fell to the ground. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You're claiming to have seen the exact moment in which the murder took place? Oldbag: Absolutely! That gun made a terrible racket when it was fired. Kay: You didn't try to go help the person that got shot? Oldbag: I'm only one person, you smart-alecky brat! What could I have done!? But I took off as soon as I could to find someone who could help. Oldbag: It was a very terrifying experience, let me tell you! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: .................. Oldbag: .................. Well, don't you have anything to say to me!? Edgeworth: No, not especially. Oldbag: You're so cold, Edgey-poo. But... that is exactly what I like about you. Kay: You sure are one tough cookie! One part unshakable, and one part scary... Oldbag: Watch that smart mouth of yours, missy! What do you know about my fragile heart!? Edgeworth: (I can tell this is an important piece of testimony, but she's rather vague in a few spots. *sigh* I suppose this means I'm going to have to talk with her some more...) After pressing second and third statements: Edgeworth: (Two men, one bullet... It's all consistent with what we found out from the body.) Sadly, there wasn't exactly a lot of new information to go on in your testimony... Oldbag: Well, if I saw the guy again, I'm sure I could identify him for you! I mean, how do you expect me to remember anything without something to jog my memory!? Kay: Self-centered, aren't we? Edgeworth: While it was somewhat useful, her testimony also presents us with a new problem... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: So, about this new problem... Edgeworth: What is that giant grin on your face for? Kay: Do you want me to show you something really nice? Edgeworth: ...No, thank you. Kay: Don't be so mean! I swear it's something you're going to like! Edgeworth: What is that gadget you're holding? Kay: What you see before you is the secret weapon of a Great Thief! Edgeworth: ...Ahh, I should have known it would be worthless. Kay: Aww, don't be like that! Tee hee. *ahem!* What do you think now!? Edgeworth: What is it doing...? It's projecting something into the air... Kay: I'm going to input the necessary information to run the simulation now. Once I'm done, I'll increase the size of the projection to its maximum size... Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood! Re-creation Edgeworth: Wh-What is this!? Kay: This is a re-creation of the murder based on the info I inputted into Little Thief! Edgeworth: L-Little Thief? I dare say I think you're taking the Robin Hood thing a bit too far... Kay: Little Thief is actually meant to be a simulator for me to plan my thefts. But I suppose if I used it like this... Let's see... Ms. Oldbag said that the two men were facing each other. And then, a gunshot rang out, and the victim fell to the ground... Edgeworth: Ah... So with this, we can inspect the crime scene as it was in the past. Kay: See! So, what do you think? Edgeworth: I have to say, I'm impressed by the technology thieves have access to these days. Kay: Well, it IS the super-secret weapon of the mighty Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: Indeed. Kay: Oh, but if there isn't enough information, or if something is out of place... ...the re-creation could come out a little strange. Edgeworth: In other words, I can use this to authenticate the validity of a witness's testimony? Kay: You got it! You really catch on quick, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Right now, this simulation is a re-creation of that witness's testimony... So for now, I should re-examine everything... ...and if I find anything illogical or strange, I can then ask for clarification.) Kay: Feel free to examine anything in this simulation in the way you always do! You can even present evidence when you find a contradiction! And if you find something, I've got Little Thief with me, so you just let me know, OK? Begin Investigation Stadium Talk Ema Skye Ema: This is amazing! Just FEEL the power of science! Wendy Oldbag Oldbag: What is this? Some sort of new attraction? Examine Victim Leads to: \"According to the testimony, the victim fell to the ground here...\" Stage Edgeworth: It looks like they broke the stage down (Stage was packed up - The stage I saw this morning in the center of this stadium has been packed away.). Kay: I guess this means they're done for the day... Edgeworth: Or maybe it's because a different show is scheduled to start its run tomorrow. Killer Edgeworth: (It's the silhouette of the killer with his gun at the ready.) Kay, is it not possible to re-create the face of the killer? Kay: Well, I can't exactly input what we don't know into Little Thief. Edgeworth: (She has a point...) Partner Talk Re-creation Edgeworth: So, you believe that this gadget will provide us with the proof we need? Kay: Yeah, of course! Pretty neat, huh? By inputting info like this, it can re-create the crime scene exactly as it was. Although, Little Thief was originally intended to be a training sim for heists... Edgeworth: A training sim for thievery!? I don't believe I can turn a deaf ear to that, Kay. Kay: Bah, it's for practice! Practice! It's not like I've actually stolen anything yet! Besides, we're in the middle of an investigation! So stop nit-picking! Edgeworth: Even if it is just \"practice\", I can't exactly endorse the act of stealing. Although, admittedly, this device is rather useful in an investigation. Using Little Thief (appears after \"Re-creation\") Edgeworth: So, how am I supposed to use this to aid my investigation...? Kay: Oh! That's right! I guess I should explain how to use it, huh? Objects outlined in yellow are things that are not present in our time, but were in the past. Things outlined in a dotted line are things that exist now, but didn't in the past. Edgeworth: I see... Kay: You can examine and interact with replicated people and objects as you normally do. You can even present evidence whenever you find an inconsistency. Oh, and be sure to point out mistakes in the re-creation with evidence, too! Edgeworth: Hmm... Very well, let's continue with the investigation. Kay: If there's something you don't get about Little Thief, feel free to ask anytime, OK? Edgeworth: According to the testimony, the victim fell to the ground here... Kay: That's right. But...? Edgeworth: But, if that's the case, then we've already found our first contradiction. Kay: Huh? What? Where!? Edgeworth: If this is the real scene of the crime, there's something missing that should be here. Which piece of evidence shows the missing item? Present Mr. Deacon's Murder Notes Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is the contradiction!\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Kay: .................. Maybe you're still adjusting to the simulation...? Edgeworth: ...Y-Yes, that's it. Allow me to find my bearings, and I'll present the contradiction again. (Maybe I need to review the evidence again. It should go without saying that the truth lies in what is missing from this scene!) Leads back to: \"Which piece of evidence shows the missing item?\" Edgeworth: This is the contradiction! Kay: Eh? Is something wrong with my re-creation? Edgeworth: If this is the real scene of the crime, something specific should be here. If you think back, how did we deduce that the other crime scene was not the real one? Kay: Oh! I get what's missing now! There's no blood on the ground here either, right? Edgeworth: Right. The fact that there is no blood here casts doubt on the witness's testimony. Oldbag: Edgey-poooooooo! How can you doubt me like that!? Are you calling me a liar!? I know what I saw! And I saw the victim get shot down! Kay: You know, I don't think she's lying, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (To be honest, I can't think of a reason why she would lie to me. In that case, maybe there is another explanation for the distinct lack of blood (Why is there no blood? - Why is there no blood around the victim's prone body?).) Examine Victim Edgeworth: (Now I'm fairly convinced that the victim was killed here. But then why is there no blood? There must be some explanation for this contradiction! Perhaps I should go over all of the information I've gathered one more time...) Logic Connect \"Victim was kidnapper?\" and \"Why is there no blood?\" Leads to: \"Is it not possible that the victim was wearing a costume?\" Edgeworth: Is it not possible that the victim was wearing a costume? Kay: So you really think that Mr. Deacon was one of the kidnappers? Edgeworth: I think we can reasonably assume there is a very good chance that he was. And that if he was [sic] shot while he was inside one of those stolen costumes... Kay: ...Then Mr. Deacon's blood would be inside the costume instead of on the ground! Edgeworth: Precisely. Now, if only we could prove that the victim was wearing a costume... Kay: You'd think it'd be pretty easy if we could find some footprints... ...but the problem is FINDING them, since there doesn't seem to be any around. Edgeworth: (Footprints, huh...? I wonder how we can go about finding some of those...?) Talk Ema Skye Footprint analysis Leads to: \"Ema, about that method you were talking about for finding footprints...\" Examine Victim Edgeworth: (Was the victim really wearing a costume? Maybe we can find out if we did some footprint analysis forensics...) Edgeworth: Ema, about that method you were talking about for finding footprints... Ema: Ah, finally my expert knowledge in forensics is needed! Edgeworth: Yes, well... Can you detect and trace even partial footprints? Ema: Leave it to me! My cutting-edge detection kit can find anything! Edgeworth: Very well. If you could please analyze the footprints in this area... Ema: OK! Stand back now, and witness the power of science at work! Ema: Hey! I found something! Look, right here! Edgeworth: ? I don't see anything... Ema: Oh, that's right! Here, put these special glasses on, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ! These footprints here were definitely left by a Badger costume! Ema: Judging by the way the prints are layered, those seem to be the newest. Edgeworth: (Then... we can conclude that the victim was definitely wearing a costume at the time.) Victim's Costume data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: OK! In that case, I'll update Little Thief's simulation parameters! I can't wait to see what we find out from this new info! Re-creation Investigation Complete Edgeworth: So the victim was wearing a costume when he died. Kay: And with that, we should be one step closer to the truth, right? Edgeworth: (Hmm... I see the re-creation has changed in accordance with the new information.) We may be closer, but now, something else has caught my attention. Oldbag: What do you want? Edgeworth: Your testimony, naturally. I'd like to hear it one more time, if you please. Testimony -- What Oldbag Witnessed -- Oldbag: I came to this stadium to take a short break. As I was resting, I happened to glance over and I saw two men facing each other in that area. Suddenly, there was a loud gunshot, and the person who was shot fell to the ground. It was a very terrifying experience, let me tell you! Kay: So! Does this mean that Ms. Oldbag's testimony has a contradiction in it? Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe our best course of action is to compare it with your re-creation. Kay: See! I just KNEW Little Thief would be of help! Now let's see if we can pull more info from Ms. Oldbag to put into the re-creation! Edgeworth: For that, we must first find the contradiction in her testimony. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean you took a break from being the Pink Badger? Oldbag: You may not think it, but it's hard work keeping kids' dreams alive. You smell of sweat, your hip creaks with pain -- you even begin to dream about work. Kay: That's the kind of story that would scar a child for life, you know... Oldbag: Well, that's why I chose to come take my break here, whippersnapper! I don't plan on playing the part of the Dead Badger in front of a bunch of kids! Edgeworth: So what did you see while you, the Pink Badger, were resting? Oldbag: Oh, yes, that! Well! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You saw two men...? Can you describe them for me?

What do you know about my fragile heart!? Edgeworth: Knowing what we know now, thanks to your re-creation... Kay: ...The contradiction stands out like a giant sore thumb! Edgeworth: Precisely.

The contradiction lies in the fact that the murder notes state that despite the victim being shot with a bullet going clean through the body, there was very little blood at the site where the body was found. Meanwhile, Oldbag's testimony implies the murder took place right there at the stadium, where she saw the victim fall to the ground. The lack of blood at the scene contradicts the idea that the victim was shot and fell there, implying the body was moved after the shooting and not directly at the location Oldbag witnessed.\n",

Edgeworth: (...It's time.) Gumshoe: Don't worry, Mr. Edgeworth! I'll be following your every movement with my binoculars! Edgeworth: Good to hear. Now make sure you don't lose sight of me. I'm counting on you for backup. Gumshoe: You can count on me, sir! Edgeworth: I have to go. The kidnapper is supposed to contact me soon. (Who would've thought that upon my return, I'd be thrust into a kidnapping case. And that I would be the one who would have to make the ransom drop-off...) Edgeworth: (Let's see... I checked that the money is all there, safe inside this suitcase... Now all I have to do is await further instructions from the kidnapper... ...which I'm expecting to be transferred to my cell phone. I wonder who else is around? This is the meeting place, after all...) ???: Welcome to Gatewater Land! Edgeworth: Hm? Oh, thank you. ???: And a big hello to you! I'm the Proto Badger! Nice to meet you! ............ Edgeworth: ............ Proto B.: Excuse me, but were you perhaps thinking of taking a picture of me? Edgeworth: A picture...? Of you...? Sorry, but I'm not interested. Proto B.: Aww, that's too bad. Well, have a good day! Edgeworth: ...Hello? ???: ...Who aRE yOu? YoU'Re nOt ERNesT AmaNo! Edgeworth: (It sounds like the kidnapper is using some sort of voice alteration device...) I'm his representative, Miles Edgeworth. ???: ...ARE YoU a cOP?

(I was hoping for an exchange, but maybe I should do as they say for now and not push it.) Edgeworth: (I couldn't catch even a glimpse of the kidnapper. Perhaps I should keep an eye on this haunted house until police backup arrives.) Edgeworth: (Agh! It was a trap!) March 13, 11:23 AM ???????????? Examine evidence Prosecutor's Badge Front of badge Edgeworth: This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so. Back of badge Edgeworth: Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else! ???: That guy... betrayed... ???: No... can't be... Then the deal... Edgeworth: (Who is that...?

Edgeworth: Where am I...? (How long was I out...? It wasn't raining like it is now when I made the drop-off... This was supposed to be a simple affair... ...so why have I been taken hostage as well!? I can only assume Detective Gumshoe lost sight of me at some point.) Edgeworth: The only reason I agreed to be the drop-off man was because of that phone call. It was from Mr. Ernest Amano, the director of the powerful zaibatsu, the Amano Group. But aside from that, I also owe him a great debt of gratitude. His only son, Lance, had been kidnapped. I know that Lance is already in his twenties, but I guess some things you never grow out of. Edgeworth: .................. (I can't sit around waiting for someone to come help me! I must escape somehow...) ...Nnnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!! ???: Hahaha! Was that you making that funny sound!? Edgeworth: ............Who's there!? And how dare you laugh at a gentleman's plight!? ...Who are you? Are you one of the kidnappers? ???: A kidnapper? Me? No way! I'm not into such petty crimes. Nope! I'm after something much, much bigger! Edgeworth: .................. (Argh! I must be worn out from today's ordeal. Focus, Miles!) ???: Oh, I forgot to introduce myself! Sorry about that! Ahem! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: Great Thief? (And did she really just claim to be the Yatagarasu?) Kay: Oh, but my real name is Kay Faraday. You can call me \"Kay\", 'kay!? Good! Glad that's settled! Edgeworth: .................. Not quite. I have a mountain of questions for you... ...but first, if you would be so kind as to remove these ropes. Kay: Hmm... I wonder... Should I remove them? I was actually having a lot of fun watching you make those silly faces... Edgeworth: .................. Kay: Hey! There's no need to get all mad and icy glare-y on me, you know! This rope goes through here, and... there you go! Edgeworth: What a relief. I owe you my thanks. Kay: Ah, it's OK. You can pay me back in full later! Edgeworth: (Now then... What question should I start with? Unfortunately, I can already tell nothing is going to be easy with this cheeky girl...) Talk Great Thief Edgeworth: You call yourself a Great Thief, yet are you really a thief at all? Kay: You doubt me? I get it! You think that a young lady like me couldn't possibly be such a big-time thief, right? Edgeworth: (That's... not the part I have a tough time believing...) Kay: I am the real, genuine Yatagarasu, you know. Yup! I'm a pure-blooded Great Thief! It's a little something I inherited from my predecessor. Edgeworth: In that case... you wouldn't mind if I arrested you then, right? Kay: What!? Of course I'd mind! I haven't stolen anything yet! Seriously, I don't know how you can (changed from [can you] in the original release, correcting the typo) say such a horrible thing to your savior! Edgeworth: (That's true. Technically, she hasn't stolen anything in front of me... yet.) Yatagarasu (appears after \"Great Thief\") Edgeworth: When you say you're the \"Yatagarasu\", do you mean you are THE Yatagarasu...? Kay: Yup! The most righteous of the righteous! The legendary Great Thief! But I inherited the title only recently (changed from [the title was only recently succeeded to me] in the original release)... ...so I haven't had a chance to steal anything yet as the second Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: (I was not aware that thieves could pass down their titles like that...) Kay: But don't worry! I've got some big plans in the works! Edgeworth: Big plans, huh? They wouldn't happen to lead to a big arrest, would they? Kay: I knew it! There's just no reasoning with a prosecutor. Edgeworth: I'm not the problem here! Kay: I'll have you know that the Yatagarasu has no interest in stealing petty trinkets! There's one thing and only one thing I want to steal! Edgeworth: (Only one thing? And what would that be?) Kay: But that's going to have to wait until we find our way out of here! Edgeworth: Well, at least there is one thing we agree on. I'm sure I'll have plenty of time later to learn more about you. Present Anything Kay: Don't surprise me like that! I can't believe you're just shoving things in my face! I mean, aren't there more pressing things you'd rather ask little ol' me? Edgeworth: (She has a point... I should probably find out more about my mysterious savior first.) After clearing \"Yatagarasu\" Talk option: Kay: So, you never told me what your name is, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: Ah, I guess not. I'm Miles Edgeworth. Kay: Aha! Now I remember! Edgeworth: (...How can you \"remember\" something I just told you...? But she sure is cheery.) Kay: Alright, then Mr. Edgeworth, let's get outta here! ............Hm? Edgeworth: ...It would seem that we are locked in from the other side. Kay: What!? No way! I don't hear you! La la la! Edgeworth: Kay, you do remember where you came in from, right...? It looks like that might be our only way out of this room... Kay: Whoops, slight miscalculation. That's a good height to make an entrance from, but I can't jump that high to make an exit! Edgeworth: ...*sigh* I suppose we have no choice but to look around and see if we can't find another way out. Begin Investigation Isolation Room Talk Kay Faraday Present anything Kay: Hey! Don't you think getting out of here is more important right now!? You can ask me about that later! Edgeworth: (I suppose she's right...) Examine Cell phone Leads to: \"Hm? Isn't this my phone?\" Lockers Kay: Man! Why did they have to put the windows so high up, anyway!? How is a thief supposed to make her daring escape!? Edgeworth: I suppose we could make our way out if we were able to climb on top of these lockers. Kay: Haha! That's pretty clever! You'd make a good thief yet, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Please don't ever place my name and the word \"thief\" in the same sentence again. Kay: Let's see... I wonder if I can jump and grab the top of the locker here... Man! Why did they have to make such ginormous lockers, anyway!? Edgeworth: (Even if we wanted to use these lockers, we'd need some sort of foothold (Lockers - If we can get to the top, then we can escape. If only there were some footholds...)...) Boxes Kay: Hey! There's something inside the bottom-right box. Oh, I think it's a Pink Badger costume! Edgeworth: Pink Badger...? Kay: You don't keep up with what's going on in the world, do you? In that case, you'd better study up on the whole Badger clan with this! Edgeworth: What is this thing? Kay: Think of it as a bible of all the things you'll ever need to know about the clan! Edgeworth: (...Whatever. I suppose I can keep it as a reference guide or something.) Blue Badger Bible data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: I suppose this means that this is where they keep all the costumes? Kay: It certainly looks that way! It's like the Badger family's home! Edgeworth: (There are eight boxes, but seven of them are empty. Which means that seven of the costumes (Costumes - It seems that the costumes of the Badger family are kept in the Isolation Room.) are in use right now.) But aren't these Badgers the mascots of the police force? Kay: Well, I heard that the police had a hand in sponsoring this theme park. Probably because the Gatewater Group owes the police from all those cases they solved. Edgeworth: They have all the power of the state, and they used it to make a theme park!? Kay: It's not just any theme park! They have a handcuff-shaped, double-looping roller coaster... Edgeworth: That's quite enough. I'm feeling woozy from just the thought of such a thing. (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Key Edgeworth: And what have we here...? Kay: Ah! .................. Edgeworth: (Why do I feel a laser-like stare aimed right at me?) D-Did you want to take a look? Kay: Well, don't mind if I do! Ooh! I see! Yes, this is definitely...! A key (Tiny key - I may be able to open something, somewhere in this room with this key.)! I'm sure it's a key to something! Edgeworth: The \"something\" is what is relevant to my interest... Blue Badger boxes Kay: Look! It's the Blue Badger! Edgeworth: (I suppose even this thing can be popular with women.) Kay: My nemesis (changed from [I can't stand him] in the original release)! Edgeworth: Wh-What in the...!? (Why is she beating it (changed from [suddenly beating the Blue Badger's image] in the original release) up!?) Kay: He's got the word \"badge\" right in his name! That [sic] nothing but bad news for someone like me! (changed from [How bad is that for a girl like me!?] in the original release) And to think he's out there wandering around in this park... I'd better be careful, or he's going to arrest me by the power of his name alone! Edgeworth: (I somehow doubt that the Blue Badger has the power to arrest anyone.) Bad Badger boxes Edgeworth: So this is the Blue Badger's rival, the Bad Badger, huh. Do you feel some sort of reverence towards this Badger, Kay? Kay: ...Hah! I can't believe you would be so stereotypical when it comes to thieves! Surely you must also think there are much cooler, and cuter ones out there, right? That's it! I've decided that thieves and thievery need an image makeover! Edgeworth: (...Good luck with that one.) Proto Badger boxes Edgeworth: This is that Blue Badger I met at the main gate. Kay: Excuse me, but his name is \"Proto Badger\", not \"Blue Badger\"! He's based off of the very first design created by the local police chief. You know, when you compare the two, the Blue Badger looks a bit cuter! Edgeworth: I suppose as he continued to redesign him, the chief managed to make him cuter and cuter. Even humanity has come a long way when you think about how much we've evolved. Kay: Are we comparing the Blue Badger to humans now...? Pink Badger boxes Edgeworth: I suppose this is the Pink Badger? But since it has the same design, doesn't it seem forced to call this one a female? Kay: You think so? I mean, just look at how long her eyelashes are! Edgeworth: That's the only difference. Kay: And the fact that she's pink. Edgeworth: Yes, and? Kay: And her lips are red! See, lipstick! Edgeworth: .................. (What? She has nothing to say about the giant pink ribbon, or is that too obvious?) Boxes (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Boxes (subsequent times, after examining key) Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Beam Edgeworth: This is the beam I was tied to. ............ Kay: Hm? What's up? Edgeworth: I was pondering if perhaps we could make it over to and out the window if we climbed this. Kay: Good thinking! And if it's climbing action you need, just leave it to me! Edgeworth: Thanks. This little hook looks like it might make for a good foothold. Up you go, Kay, and good luck! Kay: Count on it! The Great Thief Yatagarasu spreads her mighty wings, and takes to the skies! Here I go! Kay: ............ Edgeworth: As I thought, this beam (The beam I was tied to - There is a hook on this beam, but it's not enough of a foothold to climb out with.) was definitely not made for climbing. Kay: What do you mean, \"As I thought\"!? I'm not your guinea pig, you know! Beam (subsequent times) Edgeworth: This is the beam I was tied to. ............ Just maybe, we can use this to climb up to and out the window. Kay: Leave it to me! ...............Wait. Didn't I just try this!? I can't climb this thing! Edgeworth: (I suppose we'll just have to find another way to escape.) Bad Badger head Edgeworth: What is this...? Kay: Looks like the Bad Badger, and it's looking as bad as ever! Edgeworth: Looks like a costume head to me. Kay: I guess the Bad Badger's costume is, at the very least, a two-piece, huh. Edgeworth: (The real question is, why is only the head sitting out here on the floor?) Bad Badger's Head data jotted down in my Organizer. Bad Badger head (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What is this...? Kay: Looks like the Bad Badger, and it's looking as bad as ever! Edgeworth: Looks like a costume head to me. Kay: I guess the Bad Badger's costume is, at the very least, a two-piece, huh. Edgeworth: (The real question is, why is only the head sitting out here on the floor?) Paint cans Kay: Maybe we can use this paint to help us escape... Edgeworth: And what exactly do you have in mind? Kay: Well, we could paint \"HELP\" in really giant letters! Edgeworth: And who, pray tell, would see these giant letters? We're inside a building. Kay: OK, then how about we light the paint on fire and send out colored smoke signals! Anyone who saw it would think some crazy arsonist was about, and call the cops! Hmm... Actually, that may not be all that great for me, seeing as I'm a thief and all. Edgeworth: ...Let's try to find something other than this paint to use, shall we? Photo rally sign Edgeworth: They're holding a Blue Badger photo rally? Kay: You didn't know? Plus, it's not just the Blue Badger, it's his whole family, too. If you manage to snap a shot of every member of the family, you get a really posh prize. Edgeworth: Well, there's a costume head sitting over there. Why not start with a picture of that? Kay: You can't do that! That's cheating! There's only one of each Badger in the park, so you have to work for it! Edgeworth: Speaking of Badgers, there was one sitting against a wall in the haunted house. Kay: Seriously? But somehow, I don't think that one counts, Mr. Edgeworth! You have to take pictures of the costumed ones walking around the park! Edgeworth: (Hmm... So these are the rules of this game? How quaint...) Badger Photo Rally data jotted down in my Organizer. Photo rally sign (subsequent times) Edgeworth: They're holding a Blue Badger photo rally? Kay: You didn't know? Plus, it's not just the Blue Badger, it's his whole family, too. If you manage to snap a shot of every member of the family, you get a really posh prize. Edgeworth: Well, there's a costume head sitting over there. Why not start with a picture of that? Kay: You can't do that! That's cheating! There's only one of each Badger in the park, so you have to work for it! Edgeworth: Speaking of Badgers, there was one sitting against a wall in the haunted house. Kay: Seriously? But somehow, I don't think that one counts, Mr. Edgeworth! You have to take pictures of the costumed ones walking around the park! Edgeworth: (Hmm... So these are the rules of this game? How quaint...) Door Edgeworth: Nnrgh... It seems that we won't be able to open this by ourselves. It also seems quite thick, so we can't just break it down. (There must be another way out of here.) Edgeworth: (Hm? Isn't this my phone? It looks like it made it through the ordeal intact.) Kay: If only there was [sic] a way for us to contact someone on the outside... Edgeworth: Ah, but we do have a way... right here. Kay: Ah! There was a cell phone here this whole time!? Edgeworth: If I'm right, Detective Gumshoe should have contacted the precinct for backup by now. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Are you OK!? I was so worried, sir! Edgeworth: I'm fine. I was knocked unconscious for a spell by the kidnapper, that's all. Gumshoe: I'm sorry, sir! I'm such a failure! If only I hadn't lost sight of you...! Edgeworth: Detective, we don't have time for this. Have the police set up a perimeter right now! Gumshoe: You don't have to worry about that, sir! I already got the boys working on that! But in doing that... I sorta... Aaaah...! Edgeworth: What's wrong, Detective? ???: ...Sorry to butt in, but I'm afraid you're going to have to make do (changed from [make due] in the original release, correcting the typo) with me. Edgeworth: Who is this? Lang: Shi-Long Lang of Interpol. A pleasure to speak with you, Mr. Edgeworth. I've heard a great deal about you. Edgeworth: So why exactly is an Interpol agent like yourself involved in a domestic kidnapping case? Lang: Don't sweat the details. A crime's a crime whether it's on a local or a global scale. Besides... ...you're the one who's in a world of trouble. Edgeworth: A-And why would you say that!? Lang: Lang Zi says: \"The pack that runs together, stays together.\" You catch my drift? You caused quite a ruckus by running blindly into a situation and then getting caught. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Lang: You should've contacted the police from the very beginning. Edgeworth: I'm sorry that this happened because of a lapse in judgement. However, I humbly request that you please help me out of here posthaste. Lang: ......Sorry, no can do. Edgeworth: What!? Lang: We're hunting the kidnapper now, and I haven't got any hands to spare. As I said, my pack moves as one. You're the one who wanted to go it alone, so good luck to you... Mr. Prosecutor. Oh, and once we do catch the kidnapper, rest assured we'll come find you... eventually. Edgeworth: ...You... You... Kay: What's wrong? Did you get cut off!? Edgeworth: No... My phone ran out of power. Kay: No way! Edgeworth: It doesn't matter anyway. We should try to get out of here through our own means. Kay: Yeah! I have a name to live up to, after all! If we put our heads together, we're sure to find a way out! Talk Kay Faraday The kidnapping (appears after examining cell phone, Bad Badger head, and photo rally sign) Edgeworth: Do you know where the person who kidnapped me went? Kay: Well, after they locked you up in here... ...it sounded like they went into the next room, and started talking to someone. Edgeworth: (I feel like I heard something as well, but it's all a haze in my mind. However, I do recall that the kidnapper was talking with someone... It was just a guess before, but I guess I really AM dealing with two kidnappers here.) Kay: After that, they left. It almost seemed as if they were done with you. Edgeworth: I suppose that is the case, as my kidnapping seems like an afterthought to the $1 million. Well, if they went into the next room, let's see what we can find out through the slot. Examine Door (after clearing \"The kidnapping\" Talk option) Kay: Ooh, we can peer into the room the kidnappers were in from there! Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Beam Edgeworth: There is a beam in the next room identical to the one in this room. There's even a hook on it to hold a propped-up floor panel in place. Which reminds me... Kay: Did you find something useful, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Hmm, perhaps. I may have found a very handy hint to how we'll get out of here. Hatch Edgeworth: Is that what I think it is? Kay: It looks like the kidnappers had an escape tunnel prepared just in case. That's awesome! They're like a bunch of Great Thieves themselves! Edgeworth: No, they're not, because I highly doubt they made the tunnel themselves. The floor panel was removed and propped up (Open floor panel - The panel is held in place by a hook. The entrance to an underground room perhaps?) against the beam in a very specific way. I think this building was originally built with a basement or underground area. Gray door Edgeworth: There's a door on the opposite side that appears to be the same as this one. Which would mean... ...that I can probably assume that these two rooms are very similar in structure. (I believe I may have just found our ticket out.) Door (subsequent times, after examining hatch) Kay: Ooh, we can peer into the room the kidnappers were in from there! Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Logic Connect \"Open floor panel\" and \"The beam I was tied to\" Leads to: \"This hook on this beam...\" Edgeworth: This hook on this beam... Kay: You know I already tried, and there's no way I can jump from this hook to the window! Come on, even you have to admit when something's just not possible. Edgeworth: Hah, I wasn't about to suggest that again. Rather, that it's here for a different purpose. Kay: Really!? Like what!? Edgeworth: As you saw in the adjacent room, it's clearly for keeping a floor panel propped up. Which means that there should be a panel in this room that we can open as well. Kay: Oh! I get it! Edgeworth: We didn't notice its existence all this time because it was being hidden by this tarp. Kay: Alright then! Let's fold this thing up and see what's underneath! Kay: Now THIS is what I call a treasure! Examine Closed hatch Kay: Wow, this must be another entrance to the secret, hidden basement! I totally smell treasure! Edgeworth: The scent I wish to smell is the sweet fragrance of freedom. Kay: Then what are you waiting for!? Hurry up and open the hatch! Edgeworth: Alright. .........Mmnph. This thing is locked down tight (Underground entrance - We might be able to escape through here, but the door is locked.). Kay: Aww! Fiddlesticks! Logic Connect \"Tiny key\" and \"Underground entrance\" Leads to: \"I believe you're up, Kay.\" Edgeworth: I believe you're up, Kay. Kay: Huh? Why me? Edgeworth: Because we need to use the tiny key that you've taken quite a liking to. Kay: Oh, gotcha! Just leave it to me! I love the tense feeling of these moments when you're about to uncover something big! Edgeworth: I believe the feeling of freedom would be much more satisfying right about now. Kay: Alright! I got the secret door open! And now...! Edgeworth: Ack! Wait! Kay: Wha--!? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: Are you alright!? Kay!? Kay: I'm fine. The ladder just slipped is all! Edgeworth: (Thank goodness she's alright. I about had a coronary...) Kay: There's a lot of really large machinery down here. Edgeworth: What about an exit? Kay: Umm... It's really dark and cramped down there, so I really doubt there's an exit. Argh, I can't believe that happened! Edgeworth: You have only yourself to blame for leaping before you looked, you know. Kay: No way! I mean, how was I supposed to know that the ladder is removable (Underground ladder - It looks as though it can be easily removed, but is it really safe to use...?)!? Examine Open hatch Edgeworth: (I finally got the door to the underground area open...) Kay, I just want to confirm with you that there wasn't an exit down there. Kay: Yeah, it was really cramped, and there was a lot of really large machinery. Edgeworth: I see. Are you hurt at all? Kay: I'm perfectly fine! I was just a little surprised when the ladder suddenly slipped out from under me... Edgeworth: (I wonder if this ladder can be put to some use...) Logic Connect \"Lockers\" and \"Underground ladder\" Leads to: \"I've figured out how we will escape this prison, Kay.\" Edgeworth: I've figured out how we will escape this prison, Kay. Kay: Oh? So, how are we going to bust out? Edgeworth: It seems that your reckless actions were of use after all. Kay: ...Are you actually praising me? Edgeworth: More of a \"thank you\" for giving me an idea regarding this ladder. Kay: The underground ladder? What about it? Edgeworth: This ladder isn't just for those who wish to go down... Kay: Oh! I see! If we use this...! Edgeworth: Yes, I believe it's long enough to reach the top of those lockers. Kay: Well, then what are we waiting for!? Investigation Complete Kay: Alright! Now we can get out of here! Edgeworth: Yes... We spent entirely too much time in here. (Kidnappers who held me hostage, and a mysterious Interpol agent... This case is only getting started, and I'll be the one to bring it to a resounding end!) March 13, 12:11 PM Wild, Wild West Area Edgeworth: It looks like it's stopped raining for now. Kay: Yeah, and thank goodness! You have no idea how hard it was raining earlier! ???: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm so glad to see you managed to escape, sir! I was so stressed that I thought my heart was gonna give out! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, may I ask what in the world that is? Gumshoe: Well, that's... um... MIB: Count off! 1! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 98! 99! MIB: Shifu! All 99 members are here and accounted for, sir! ???: Heh... What the heck do you think you're doing counting my cubs off like that!? Every person is a valuable human being, you get me? And everyone has a name that their parents gave to them. No one is a 2 or a 3... Everyone, regardless of age or rank, is number 1! Got it!? Shifu! Shifu! Edgeworth: ...You are Agent Lang, I take it? MIB: You infidel! How dare you address our Shifu so rudely!? Lang: Grr! Lang Zi says: \"A cub who disrespects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder.\" So don't you ever forget to show the proper respect towards another person! Shih-na. This isn't much, but please accept my card. Edgeworth: Oh, thank you. ...Please, accept mine in return. Lang: You all see that just now!? That is the proper way for two people to show their respect! Keep that in mind and you'll get far in life, got it!? Edgeworth: (Ah, that's right... Franziska did warn me... Something about an elite Interpol Agent from the Republic of Zheng Fa. Apparently, this man has the highest successful arrest rate in the organization.) Agent Lang, why exactly is an Interpol agent involved with this clearly domestic case? Lang: That's none of your business, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: How is it not!? Lang: I've heard a rumor or two about you. You solved a murder that occurred during your flight home recently, right? Hah! But you sure took a while just to arrest one little flight attendant. How pathetic. Gumshoe: H-How dare you say that about Mr. Edgeworth!? Are you saying you could've solved it faster, pal!? Lang: The comedic relief jumps to the aid (changed from [aide] in the original release) of his master... How cliché. Look, what I'm getting at is that if I had been there, no one would've died. Edgeworth: ! Lang: I would've solved the entire case and Agent Hicks would still be with us here today. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang knew yesterday's victim, Agent Akbey Hicks...?) Lang: Hicks was like a brother to me, so now, I'm out to take my revenge! Edgeworth: (Agent Hicks was investigating a smuggling ring with Franziska and a third person... This must be the man she was talking about.) In that case, you should understand how I feel, as the kidnapped is someone I know. So I ask that you please allow me to participate in the investigation... Lang: Lang: This isn't your neatly trimmed Courtroom of Eden, you know. You're out in the wilderness now, Mr. Prosecutor, and way out of your league. No hard feelings, but why don't you go on back to your courtroom now, pretty boy? Edgeworth: You...! You dare to mock the court!? Lang: I do... And I don't need the help of a filthy \"prosecutor\". Sorry, but the truth doesn't need the likes of you to distort it today! Edgeworth: (Who uses the adjective \"filthy\" to describe a prosecutor...!? And why...? Why do I feel such intense loathing emanating from him!?) Lang: Alright, men! Good job on the perimeter around Gatewater Land. Now just find me the kidnapper, and bring the punk to me! Dismissed! Sir! Lang: Now then, Mr. Prosecutor, you just sit tight here and don't cause any trouble, understand? Edgeworth: W-Wait! Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: It's been a while since I last met someone so disagreeable. (Why of all places did he show up here? And completely out of the blue at that! I suppose I'll have to ask Detective Gumshoe to fill me in on that.) Talk Kay Faraday Kay: Maaaan... I can't calmly do any stealing at all with that detective around. Edgeworth: I suppose it's not easy when there's this many members of law enforcement in the vicinity. Kay: It's alright! It's not like I'm in a hurry to steal just any ol' thing! Edgeworth: (...Which is it? Do you plan to steal something or not? Quite the mystery, this one. Maybe I should talk with her a bit more.) Talk Next step Kay: So what are you going to do about your investigation into the kidnapping? Edgeworth: Good question. Since Agent Lang holds the authority to investigate this case now... ...this makes things a bit more complicated. Kay: Oh, come on, you can't let that stop you! I'll even lend you a hand, so let's go! Edgeworth: But you're a self-purported \"Great Thief\", are you not? I don't believe I can let someone of an unlawful nature participate in an investigation. Kay: You don't like to listen, do you? I'm not just any ol' (changed from [ordinary] in the original release) Great Thief; I'm the Yatagarasu! And as I said earlier... ...the Yatagarasu is after one and only one thing. \"One and only one\" (appears after \"Next step\") Edgeworth: What is this \"one and only one\" thing you're after? Kay: The Yatagarasu is only interested in one thing... ...and that is the truth. Edgeworth: I see...  Edgeworth: It was seven years ago... There was a vigilante who threw the business world into a panic. Labeled \"mysterious\" and \"phantom-like\", the Yatagarasu appeared and vanished at will. Though we still don't know much about this thief's ultimate goal, we do know the targets. The Yatagarasu liked to find and publicly disclose (changed from [make public,] in the original release) evidence of corrupt dealings of all sorts. Once a target was chosen, no dramatic calling card or announcement was sent forth. Instead, the chosen corporation was infiltrated without even the target noticing. Some days later, the evidence that was found was sent out to the mass media... ...along with a card with the mark of a three-legged raven. Looking back, I suppose you could call what the Yatagarasu was stealing the \"truth\". (Could this child really be the successor to the original Yatagarasu? But that can't be... can it...?) Present Prosecutor's Badge Kay: If I had one of these, I could be a prosecutor, too, right? Edgeworth: Don't even think of stealing this from me. Kay: If it's that important to you, then why don't you wear it on your lapel? Edgeworth: (Why should I have to label myself as a prosecutor everywhere I go? And why does everyone ask that question of me? That's what I'D like to know.) Gatewater Land Pamphlet Kay: I really love theme parks! Too bad we're not here to have a fun time... Edgeworth: So why did you choose this one, and why choose to show yourself to me of all people? Kay: Because I was tailing you, silly! Duh! Edgeworth: You were following me!? (But why?) Blue Badger Bible Kay: It's a book of information about my arch-enemy, the Blue Badger. But I won't lose to the likes of him! You just wait and see. I'm going to write a \"Tome of Thievery\"! How's that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...The information that winds up on your wanted poster will suffice in this competition.) Badger Photo Rally Kay: Come on! The Badger family is waiting for us to find and take pictures of them! And remember, you have to yell, \"Badger GET!\" each time, or it doesn't count! Edgeworth: They even have a rule for when you take their pictures...? Kay: Tell me about it! I was planning to steal all of my shots, as any proper Great Thief should! Edgeworth: (Does the concept of stealing permeate every aspect of this girl's life...?) Anything else Kay: What do you think about this? Edgeworth: If you're going to steal anything, at least keep your hands off of my lines. Kay: Alright, alright. I'll return it to you. Here you go! Edgeworth: (I was hoping for some information in return, but my line will do for now.) Dick Gumshoe Edgeworth: Great job, Detective. Gumshoe: Sir! Edgeworth: For losing sight of me and the kidnapper, and allowing my investigation to be hijacked. Gumshoe: I... Sir...! Edgeworth: I look forward to your next month's salary assessment. Gumshoe: But... But the case isn't lost yet, sir! I'm gonna show you just how much of a man Dick Gumshoe can be! Edgeworth: Shall I prepare the 21-gun salute now or later? Talk Agent Lang Edgeworth: Detective, are you sure it was the precinct you called for backup? Gumshoe: O-Of course, sir! I think I would know the number to my own precinct like back of my hand! Edgeworth: Then why did an Interpol agent show up instead, with an army of his own agents? Gumshoe: That, I have no idea... About five minutes after I made the call, that wolf-man showed up out of nowhere, sir. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang definitely has an agenda, so the question is, \"What is he after?\") Next step (appears after \"Agent Lang\") Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! I was wondering if I may ask about one thing, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, what is it? Gumshoe: Um... Who is that? The girl over there, I mean. Kay: I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant, Kay Faraday! Gumshoe: Wh-Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: Funny, I don't recall making you my assistant, Kay... Gumshoe: Yeah! I'M Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! ME! It's been like that since... forever! Kay: Sorry, but I just stole your supporting role. Gumshoe: How can you say something so serious with that giant grin on your face, pal!? Mr. Edgeworth! We've got a thief on our hands, sir! She stole my role, sir! I'm taking her in, getting her convicted, and making sure she serves out her sentence! Kay: Oh, come on, it'll be fun! Like musical chairs! You'd better stay fast on your feet! Gumshoe: No way! I won't... I will not lose the spotlight to you, little girl! Present Prosecutor's Badge Gumshoe: If you're going to show me your Prosecutor's Badge, then I'll show you my police badge! Edgeworth: ...Your wallet is looking rather thin, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? Oh, whoops. I must've left my badge at home. I always get the two mixed up. Ha ha. Edgeworth: That's not a laughing matter, Detective! Gatewater Land Pamphlet Gumshoe: Gatewater Land... Who would have guessed this place would be such a success? But the Gatewater Group and I go way back, you know? Edgeworth: Yes... Same here. I handled two murder cases that took place at two of their hotels. And it was you who headed the investigation in each case. Gumshoe: Oh, I remember that, sir! I was 16 back then, standing in front of the hotel in the snow... Edgeworth: (...Clearly, we are not on the same page here.) Blue Badger Bible Gumshoe: You actually got a copy, Mr. Edgeworth!? Ooh! Can you show me the very last page!? Edgeworth: The last page? Very well... Let's see here... ...Interesting. Why is your name listed here under \"Special Thanks\"? Gumshoe: That's it, sir! You found it! Oh... Um... That's because I did the choreography for the \"Dance, Dance, Blue Badger\" song! Edgeworth: (I suspect that no one entrusts him with any real responsibilities at work...) Badger Photo Rally Gumshoe: Oh, are you participating in the photo rally, too, Mr. Edgeworth!? Um... I mean, I'm only doing it as part of my duties! Yeah. Edgeworth: ...I see. In that case, keep up the good work. So, how many have you found so far? Gumshoe: I've been sorta busy with the investigation, so I haven't really found any yet, but... Edgeworth: (Something tells me finding the Badgers isn't really a part of his duties.) Anything else Gumshoe: I'm sorry, sir! Absolutely nothing is coming to mind right now! As a man, the only thing I can attest to is this: \"To be a man, I, Dick Gumshoe, will tell no lie!\" Edgeworth: (His heart's in the right place... Now to work on his deduction skills.) Officers Edgeworth: Excuse me, but if you could just let me through here... Officer: Sorry, I can't let anyone through. Agent Lang's orders. Edgeworth: Nnngh... (I suppose I'll have to deal with this impasse for now.) Blue Badger Blue Badger: .................. Edgeworth: (That wriggling... I just can't bring myself to call it \"dancing\"...) Examine Barrels on left side Edgeworth: I highly doubt I'll find a clue in here, but I might as well check, just to be sure. ...Mnngh. This barrel sure is heavy. You there! Do you know what's inside of this thing? Officer: It's the emergency water supply for putting out fires. Edgeworth: ...I see. Well, they certainly are well prepared. Horizontal bar Edgeworth: This horizontal bar is used... for tying up horses. Apparently, you can ride real horses at the Cowboy's Ranch area just up ahead. Is it possible that the culprits have already escaped with the help of a stolen horse or two? Officer: Under Agent Lang's orders, we already rounded up all the horses... ...and every last one has been accounted for. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang is good, although, I won't go so far as to say I'm impressed just yet...) Rocking chair Edgeworth: It's an old-fashioned rocking chair, the kind that makes you feel instantly at ease. There's something written here... \"A soothing 10-minute sitting for only $100\"...!? I see. Reverse psychology. Make it so expensive that no one would dare sit on it... Barrels by cactus Edgeworth: It's an empty barrel. I'd venture to guess that its only purpose is to set the mood. Cactus Edgeworth: It's a cactus... and there's something written here on this sign... \"This cactus is a very gracious gift to Gatewater Land from the local police precinct.\" (I can't believe the police went so far as to even donate a cactus to this place.) Garage door Edgeworth: Horses are painted on this garage door to complete the Wild West theme. They almost look like they're ready to jump out into the real world and gallop away. ...Almost, being the key word. Tracks Edgeworth: Some sort of tracks were left in the mud here thanks to the rain. They look like tire tracks. Too bad they're destroying the Wild West atmosphere they worked so hard to create. (The tires on whatever made these probably got pretty muddy, as well.) After clearing all Talk options with Dick Gumshoe and Kay Faraday: ???: Laaaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, son!? Edgeworth: Mr. Amano? Ernest: Oh! Miles, my boy! I'm sorry to involve you in such an affair just after you've returned. Edgeworth: For you, Mr. Amano, I gladly offer my assistance. After all, I have you to thank for how well things turned out during my time abroad. If it wasn't [sic] for you, I might not have been introduced to that law office... ...and had the chance to study the inner workings of another country's judicial system. Ernest: No, no, no. Think nothing of it. As you know, Manfred and I go way back. I consider a beloved disciple of his to be like one of my own blood. Edgeworth: ............ Ernest: If you ever want to go overseas again, you need only to ask. I can use my company's vast network to send you anywhere at any time. Kay: So who's the old man? Edgeworth: He is the father of the currently kidnapped Lance Amano, Ernest Amano. Ernest: Now then, have you found Lance yet, Miles? Please... I miss my poor boy dearly! Edgeworth: I'm terribly sorry, but your son's whereabouts remain unknown, Mr. Amano. Ernest: Wh-- Hold on there! Then, what happened to all that money!? Edgeworth: .........I believe the $1 million has been stolen, and that the culprits are now on the run. Ernest: Whaaaaat!? Kay: Poor old man... Don't you have anything you could give him to cheer him up, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (Forgive me, Mr. Amano...) Talk Ernest Amano Talk The kidnapping Edgeworth: I was wondering if you could please tell me the details of the kidnapping one more time? Ernest: Oh. It was yesterday... A call came to the house. From the receiver came the sound of my son... \"Help me, Daddy!\"... *sniff* Edgeworth: I know this is tough, but please stay with me here, Mr. Amano... Ernest: You don't understand. He hasn't called me \"Daddy\" in ages... It was incredibly moving... I wish I had recorded him saying that. Edgeworth: (He definitely should have recorded that conversation... ...but not for the foolish sentimentalities of an old man.) Lance Amano Edgeworth: Refresh my memory, what kind of person is Lance again? Ernest: How will telling you about Lance help you get him back? Edgeworth: Surprisingly, a lot can be deduced from a person's relationships and behavior. Ernest: Very well, then. Lance is my one and only son, and he turned 21 this year. He is very much like me when I was his age -- kind and very attractive. I'm sure women simply can't keep their hands off of him. Edgeworth: Is there anything else about him you noticed of late? Ernest: Now that you mention it, I haven't been able to get in contact with our butler, Oliver. Edgeworth: Your butler...? Ernest: Yes, his name is Oliver Deacon. He's been with our family for years now. He gets along so well with Lance, so I thought maybe he would know where my son is... Oliver Deacon (appears after \"Lance Amano\") Edgeworth: Mr. Amano, could you please tell me a little more about your butler, Mr. Deacon? Ernest: As a butler, he's outstanding. He even serves as Lance's personal private tutor. He took a brief leave recently, but even after it was over, I haven't been able to reach him. Edgeworth: So you still haven't spoken with him since his leave? What about his family and friends? Ernest: They said they hadn't seen him. I've tried everything I could think of, Miles. ...Do you think this could have something to do with Lance's kidnapping? Edgeworth: It's possible, but I can't say anything for sure quite yet. (So even the person closest to the victim has gone missing... Oliver Deacon... Sounds like one name I had better keep in mind.) Present Prosecutor's Badge Ernest: Ah... Seeing that badge reminds me of Manfred. Now, HE was one fine prosecutor, the best of the best. Edgeworth: ...Yes, I can't disagree with you there. Ernest: Hmm... I sense that you don't really want to talk about him. Edgeworth: How I feel about him... It's hard for me to be truthful about that with another person. Ernest: Your hard countenance... I don't know what you're thinking or feeling... ...but mark my words, I think you are Manfred's true successor. I really do. Edgeworth: .................. Anything else Ernest: Ho, ho! That looks to be something with quite a bit of value. But then, all things have some value attached to them. Only by probing deep into the unknown can we become true winners in this world, Miles. Edgeworth: (Thanks, but knowledge isn't what's going to make me a winner here; it's information.) After clearing all Talk options with Ernest Amano: Edgeworth: .................. Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Let's begin our investigation. Even if that Interpol agent holds the authority to head this investigation... ...we can't allow ourselves to stand idly by, twiddling our thumbs. Gumshoe: I'm with you 100%, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! I, Dick Gumshoe, pledge to stick by your side through thick and thin! Edgeworth: Mr. Amano, it was my fault that the culprits escaped. Which is why, with your blessing, I vow to return Lance to you myself. Ernest: Oh! I've never seen you so passionate before, Miles. Good luck to you, my boy. Kay: Alright! Well, what are you waiting for!? Let's do some investigating! Gumshoe: If you think I'm losing to you, pal, forget it! Begin Investigation Wild, Wild West Area Gumshoe: So what should we examine first!? Edgeworth: Hmm... Thanks to Agent Lang, we can't leave this area. But the culprits were here until only very recently. Which means we may be able to find some clues that will tell us how they escaped. Gumshoe: OK! Let's get looking! Detective: Hey! You there! Gumshoe: Who, me!? Detective: What are you doing goofing off in a place like this!? Gumshoe: I wasn't goofing off! I was about to help Mr. Edgeworth kick off his investigation. Detective: You imbecile! All precinct detectives are now under Agent Lang's direct command! Gumshoe: N-No way! I am NOT working for Wolf-boy! Mr. Edgeworth! Can't you do something...!? Edgeworth: .................. I'm not exactly in a position to argue, seeing as how you ARE a member of the police. Detective: Good, now let's go! Gumshoe: Nooooooooooooooooooooooo!!! Detective: Boy, have I got just the job for someone of your talents! Kay: Well, that was exciting. Edgeworth: ............ Kay. Kay: What? Can't you tell I'm all ready to get down to some detective work!? Edgeworth: You should go home. Your parents must be worried about you. Kay: Oh, come on! I finally get to be your assistant and you try to ditch me!? Edgeworth: ...I don't recall offering you the position. Kay: Hmmmph. Why do you have to be so difficult? Besides, it's already too late, you know! Like I said, I've already stolen the position of \"assistant\" a while back! Edgeworth: Hah. You're the only one asserting that. Kay: Well! By the time anyone notices, it's already gone! That's the Yatagarasu way! Edgeworth: You shouldn't speak so lightly of things you know nothing about! Kay: Fine, whatever, you win. Go ahead and do your little investigation. But the talented assistant Kay, is going to tag along no matter what you say! Edgeworth: (Even if she turns out to be useless, she's not going to listen to me. I might as well surrender and let her come along for the ride...) Talk Blue Badger Blue Badger: .................. Kay: Hey! It's the Blue Badger! Badger GET! Edgeworth: (I really don't understand why she is so excited over this badger hunt. Speaking of Badgers, there's a person inside of there...) Mr. Badger, I wonder if you might share with me what you saw? Blue Badger: .................. Edgeworth: (He's doing that contorted wriggling \"dance\" again...) Kay: ............ Aha! ???: Aaaah! You've uncovered my undercover identity, sir! I was to remain under that head, sir! Edgeworth: ...Aren't you Officer Meekins? Meekins: SIR! Mike Meekins, reporting for duty, sir! Edgeworth: (This man was a witness in one of the cases I headed two years ago. About the only thing I remember about this officer is that... ...he often spoke and acted before he thought, which gave me a great deal of headaches.) Kay: Is he a friend of yours, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: I've met him in the courtroom once before. (Hmm... Why was he so upset when we unmasked him? Does he have something to hide?) Mike Meekins (after talking to Blue Badger) Talk Mike Meekins Edgeworth: Officer Meekins, why are you standing here wasting time? Meekins: SIR! Because I'm not a police officer right now, sir! I'm the Blue Badger! And I'm creating memories and dreams for the kids! That's never a waste of time, sir! I have a dream to become as big as Detective Gumshoe, sir! I was patrolling the scorchingly boring beat until a little while ago... ...when the dispatch radio on my shoulder crackled that the kidnappers had escaped, sir! I thought maybe this was my shot at making Detective, sir! I rushed on over to join in, but when I got here, there was a sea of people already... ...and I couldn't spread my trademark friendliness and joy on to anyone... Edgeworth: (It would seem that some people never change...) The Blue Badger Edgeworth: So why exactly are you in that ridiculous outfit? Meekins: Sir! That's because, sir! I'm here to keep the visitors in good spirits, sir! But it's also to hide the fact that I'm an officer on the trail of a kidnapper, sir! Edgeworth: I see. Agent Lang is very wise to employ this sort of diversionary tactics. Meekins: To be handed the role of THE Blue Badger out of all the different disguises, sir... It's... It's such an honor! Any clues? (appears after \"The Blue Badger\") Edgeworth: How long have you been standing here, Officer? Meekins: SIR! For about one little hour, sir! Edgeworth: (Hmm... That's around the time I woke up from being knocked unconscious...) Meekins: And I've been here even since, sir! Edgeworth: (If that's true, then it's possible Officer Meekins saw the kidnappers escaping!) Meekins: B-B-B-However, sir! I must tell you I didn't see a thiiiiiiing, sir!!! Edgeworth: I haven't asked you anything yet, Officer. Meekins: No no no no no! B-But I know you will, sir! Edgeworth: (He's hiding something from me.) Officer Meekins, I insist that you tell me more about your recent movements! Meekins: Sir! I've been playing the Blue Badger this whole time, sir! And getting into it, too! I patrolled the park, all while wearing this costume! And about one hour ago, I came over here, sir! I haven't seen any suspicious-looking people this whole time, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: What you said just now is contradictory to the facts. Kay: How so, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: This is what Officer Meekins's testimony contradicts! Present Badger Photo Rally Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Officer Meekins, let's back things up. I'd like to ask you about your last statement.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your testimony contradicts this piece of evidence! Meekins: I'm just a little patrolman, so I don't understand what you're talking about, sir! Kay: I can't say I get it, either. Edgeworth: (Gnnnrk! This isn't what I was looking for!) I'm sorry, Officer, but could you please repeat what you said one more time? Meekins: Of course, sir! I'd be honored to repeat myself as many times as needed, sir! For almost a whole little hour, I didn't see any suspicious-looking people around, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: As I thought, what you said just now is contradictory to the facts. Kay: OK, so what exactly is so contradictory, Mr. Edgeworth? Leads back to: \"This is what Officer Meekins's testimony contradicts!\" Edgeworth: Officer Meekins, let's back things up. I'd like to ask you about your last statement. Meekins: Sir! Of course, sir! If that's your wish, Mr. Prosecutor! This little patrolman will wait as long as I am commanded to wait! Edgeworth: You said that you saw a Blue Badger, correct? And yet, if you take a look at this, what you saw was not supposed to happen. This park is supposed to have only one of each Badger in it at any given time. Which means that as long as you are the Blue Badger, Officer Meekins... ...you should not have seen another Blue Badger wandering the premises! Meekins: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!? SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!? Kay: Then, that would mean that there are two Blue Badgers (A 2nd Blue Badger - There's only supposed to be 1 Blue Badger in the park, but a second was spotted.) walking around! But why!? Any clues? (subsequent times) Edgeworth: How long have you been standing here, Officer? Meekins: SIR! For about one little hour, sir! Edgeworth: (Hmm... That's around the time I woke up from being knocked unconscious...) Meekins: And I've been here even since, sir! Edgeworth: (If that's true, then it's possible Officer Meekins saw the kidnappers escaping!) Meekins: Yup, I've been hanging around in this area ever since then, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: And yet, if you take a look at this, what you saw was not supposed to happen. This park is supposed to have only one of each Badger in it at any given time. Which means that as long as you are the Blue Badger, Officer Meekins... ...you should not have seen another Blue Badger wandering the premises! Meekins: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!? SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!? Kay: But then, that would mean that there are two Blue Badgers walking around the park! Present Prosecutor's Badge Meekins: Sir! It's so incredibly shiny, but it has a really ugly shape! I knew it! I was right to go for the much more manly police badge, sir! But I lose it alot [sic], and I just know I'm going to lose it for real one of these days, sir! Kay: ...Mr. Edgeworth, I think this cop is one donut short of a baker's dozen. Edgeworth: I know. Believe me, I know. Blue Badger Bible Meekins: Sir! You have a copy of the Blue Badger Bible, too, sir!? That was written by experts on the Badger family, sir! And it's very, very thorough! It doesn't matter that I was made the Blue Badger only a little while ago, sir! That book helped me memorize every name of every Badger, sir! Edgeworth: (It's not that hard to remember four incredibly obvious names...) Badger Photo Rally Meekins: Drip, drop, little by little our privacy is being sold off to the public through this, sir! But that means I need to work extra hard on my cute poses! Kay: Ooh, like what? Meekins: Like thiiiiiiiiiiis! Kay: Great! Now I know what your new pose will beeeeeeeeeee! Look, sir! I've successfully stolen his pose and speaking styyyyyyyyyyyyyle, sir! Edgeworth: *sigh* That's nice, Kay. Anything else Meekins: Sir! I'm undercover as the Blue Badger now, sir! I must pretend to not know anything about anything, sir! Edgeworth: (I mustn't respond to that. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel...) Ernest Amano Present Stolen Costumes Ernest: Just what sort of operation is this, that they would allow their valuables to be stolen!? It's a disgrace to the way businesses are run everywhere! Edgeworth: Well, thieves, by nature. generally tend to target these types. Ernest: Stealing is an abominable behavior, don't you agree, little miss!? Kay: ...Y-Yeah, the worst! Edgeworth: (Am I going to have to add \"hypocrite\" to the list of things you are, missy?) Examine Barrels on left side Kay: Hah! I've got you now, you vile criminals! Edgeworth: ...I'd think the kidnappers would have better sense than to try hiding in these. Kay: Oh, come on! Lighten up, will ya? I was only joking! I don't REALLY think that the criminals would be hiding here, right in front of two officers! Edgeworth: ...I-I certainly hope not. Footprints Kay: Hey! There's a bunch of footprints in the mud over here! Edgeworth: I remember hearing rain fall out here while I was being held in there. Kay: Yup, it was just a passing rain. That's why the ground has already pretty much dried up. Edgeworth: I should be thankful. It left us with some nice footprint samples. Kay: You know what? I bet if we followed them, we can find out where the kidnappers went! Plus, we'd be able to spot them because of their muddy shoes! Edgeworth: ...I don't think it will be that easy. Kay: Why not? Edgeworth: Look carefully. There are quite a few different sets here. And we don't know which ones belong to the kidnappers. Kay: Oh, that's true... We don't know what kind of shoes (What kind of shoes? - If only we knew, we'd be able to track the kidnappers from the footprints.) they were wearing. Horizontal bar Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth, isn't this one of those things you tie horses to? Edgeworth: Yes, although the horses are in another location at the moment. Kay: Aww... And here I was hoping I would get to ride one. Edgeworth: You know how to ride a horse? Kay: Nope! Never rode one in my life! But I have an Asian friend who was born in the year of the horse! Edgeworth: (\"Non sequitur\" is the only way to describe your logic...) Barrels by cactus Kay: If these were real, I wonder what you'd put in them. Edgeworth: Water would be the obvious answer... Kay: But if you stored water in a barrel under the blazing hot sun, wouldn't it go bad? Edgeworth: People of that period probably didn't care about how it tasted. Kay: Sorry, but I can't let you get away with making fun of our forefathers! I mean, maybe they really liked the strange taste! Edgeworth: ...Look who's making fun of them now. Cactus Kay: Look! There's a blurb about the cactus here! \"This cactus is a very gracious gift to Gatewater Land from the local police precinct.\" Edgeworth: (I can't believe the police went so far as to even donate a cactus to this place.) Kay: So, is the police department running a cactus farm on the side? Ha ha, just kidding! They wouldn't do something so silly! Edgeworth: (Actually, I have the vague impression I've seen a cactus farm at the precinct before.) Garage door Edgeworth: Horses are painted on this garage door to complete the Wild West theme. Kay: They look so life-like, don't you think!? Edgeworth: Are you thinking of wrangling, or rather, stealing them? Kay: If you can coax them out of there, sure! Come on, I know you can sweet-talk them out! Edgeworth: I could be holding a cube of sugar in my hand and they wouldn't budge, Kay. Tracks Edgeworth: It's a set of tire tracks originating from the garage. Kay: Aha! So that means a car left from the garage at some time, right? Edgeworth: Correct. But for the car to leave these tracks... ...it would mean that it left during the passing rain. (That's the only explanation as to why these tracks are made of mud.) Hmm, three treads... I think we can also safely assume it's a special type of car. Logic Connect \"Costumes\" and \"A 2nd Blue Badger\" Edgeworth: A second Blue Badger that shouldn't exist... Clearly, the true identity of the person underneath is... Kay: Oh, I know! It's one of the kidnappers, right!? The person wore a costume to get away (Costumed escape - The identity of the second Blue Badger was probably the kidnapper in disguise.)! Edgeworth: Precisely. After all, the costumes that went missing from the storage area are... Kay: ...A Blue Badger, a Proto Badger, and a Bad Badger. Edgeworth: Yes, those three. Kay: So there are three phony Badgers running around in the park somewhere, huh! Stolen Costumes data jotted down in my Organizer. Connect \"What kind of shoes?\" and \"Costumed escape\" Leads to: \"Now that we know that the kidnappers were wearing Badger costumes...\" Partner Kay: Yes? Talk The kidnapping Edgeworth: Kay, what do you think about the kidnapping? Kay: Well, I don't know anything about the victim... ...so actually, I was hoping you could tell me. Edgeworth: Ah, that's right. I never did explain the situation to you. I got involved because of a phone call I received. It was from none other than the director of the Amano Group, Mr. Ernest Amano. His only son, Lance, had been kidnapped, and he wanted me to be the drop-off man. Little did I suspect that I would be abducted myself. Kay: And that's when I found you tied to a pole screaming, \"Nnnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!!\" Edgeworth: Can you please drop that already!? Present Prosecutor's Badge Kay: If I had one of these, I could be a prosecutor, too, right? Edgeworth: Don't even think of stealing this from me. Kay: If it's that important to you, then why don't you wear it on your lapel? Edgeworth: (I suppose I can't really tell her... ...that no one in the Prosecutor's Office wears their badges. But why does everyone ask that question of me? That's what I'D like to know.) Stolen Costumes Kay: Looks like there's another thief afoot! Edgeworth: Only if we assume that this is not your handiwork. Kay: Are you kidding!? You know that the Blue Badger is enemy number one to me! Can you imagine me ever being on good terms with that thing!? Edgeworth: .................. Actually, it's surprisingly easy. Edgeworth: Now that we know that the kidnappers were wearing Badger costumes... ...those footprints from earlier take on a new, and very significant meaning. Kay: Oh, you mean now we know which tracks belong to the kidnappers, right!? Edgeworth: Yes. More than shoe prints, we need to follow the paw prints of Badgers. Kay: OK, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to use those footprints and go Badger hunting! Examine Footprints Leads to: \"Hmm... So we're looking for footprints made by a costume...\" Kay: Hmm... So we're looking for footprints made by a costume... Hey! I think I found them! There are two sets here! Edgeworth: They both do look like possible candidates. Kay: This set is walking off to the west... Argh! It just stops! I can't make heads or tails of where it's headed from here! Edgeworth: I think we can assume it's headed towards the stadium... Kay: Hmm... I wonder where the other set leads? This one seems to be headed east... Huh? Quick, Mr. Edgeworth! I've got him! I got one of the culprits! Meekins: Aaaah! Nooooo! I'm not a kidnapper, sir!!! Edgeworth: Down, Kay. Clearly, those footprints belong to Officer Meekins. But our criminals were each wearing a costume. Kay: Aha! Maybe they came over to this garage for something? Edgeworth: That's what I would suppose. Officer Meekins, if you could step aside for a moment. We need to examine the garage. Meekins: SIR! Roger Wilco, sir! Examine Garage door Leads to: \"Let's open this shutter and see what we find.\" Footprints Edgeworth: There are two sets of prints that could be from the kidnappers... Kay: One set is headed off to the west... Edgeworth: To the stadium, I would suppose... Kay: And the other set heads to the east... Edgeworth: We should follow these prints to their conclusion and investigate the garage. Kay: OK! Edgeworth: Let's open this shutter and see what we find. Kay: Maybe we'll find the kidnappers hiding inside! Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Edgeworth: Wh-What in the--!? (We seem to have stumbled across a dead body...) Kay: ............ Edgeworth: (She must be in severe shock to have been the first to find it... Now then, who is this man?) Ernest: I-It's Oliver! Edgeworth: ! Mr. Amano, are you saying that this man is... Ernest: Yes... He's my butler... How could something like this have happened!? Edgeworth: (Indeed. And why was Mr. Deacon here to begin with? I'd better investigate this crime scene quickly, before Agent Lang or his men return. The kidnapper's footprints lead right to this garage... ...and right to a dead body. Is it possible one of the kidnappers is now a murder victim (Victim was kidnapper? - Following a kidnapper's prints led us to a body. Was the victim in a costume?)...?) From my cursory examination, I believe this man died of a fatal bullet wound. Preliminary Findings data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: You sure are calm for someone who just found a body. Edgeworth: (It's surprising what one can become accustomed to in the span of two days...) Leads to examination of body Talk Ernest Amano Edgeworth: Mr. Amano... This body... Ernest: Yes... That's my butler, Oliver... How could something like this have happened!? Edgeworth: (Indeed. And why was Mr. Deacon here to begin with?) Examine Footprints Edgeworth: There are two sets of prints that could be from the kidnappers... Kay: One set is headed off to the west... Edgeworth: To the stadium, I would suppose... Kay: And the other set heads to the east... Edgeworth: ...Right to the garage. (Do these prints belong to the victim we found inside the garage?) Rocking chair Kay: Ooh, did you know? I really love this kind of chair, the way it rocks back and forth! When I grow old, I plan to sit in one of these and rock the day away every day! But you don't have to wait, Mr. Edgeworth! You're at just the right age for one! Edgeworth: (Do I really project myself as someone of that age?) Blue Badgermobile Edgeworth: What a peculiar car... Kay: Yeah. From the look of it, it must be the Blue Badgermobile. And it has three tires... So maybe it left those tire tracks behind!? Edgeworth: *sigh* That's simply not possible. Kay: Huh? Why? Edgeworth: Take a look at the tires. There's no mud stuck to them. Therefore, it must have been here since before it started to rain. Kay: Oh, gotcha! Good eye! Edgeworth: (It's a shame I don't see any other clues around...) Body Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Examine Pendant Edgeworth: (This is an unusually-shaped pendant...) Kay: What is it? Is it something valuable? Edgeworth: (She seems to have regained some of her composure...) Kay: It looks like a horse pendant! It's got an antique feel about it, and it's really pretty... Hold on... This is made of platinum silver! Nice! It IS worth something after all! Ooh, and look! There's something written on the back. \"Colin Devorae\"... It's a name. Edgeworth: \"Colin Devorae\"...? (But this man's name is...) Wounds Edgeworth: (As long as that Interpol agent has control of this case... ...I'm not going to be able to have a real autopsy done on the victim. I'm no doctor, but let's see what I can piece together myself.) Hmm, there are two gunshot wounds one in his abdomen and one in his shoulder. Kay: So that means he was shot twice...? Edgeworth: No, I don't think so. I think the abdominal one is an entry wound, and the one near his shoulder is the exit wound. Kay: Nice! I knew you could figure it out! Edgeworth: It comes with experience, and I've seen my share of crime scenes. (Speaking of experience... ...this crime scene seems a bit too clean for a murder where the bullet went clean through. I should make a note of this oddity.) Preliminary Findings data updated in my Organizer. Wounds (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Hmm, there are two gunshot wounds one in his abdomen and one in his shoulder. Kay: So that means he was shot twice...? Edgeworth: No, I don't think so. I think the abdominal one is an entry wound, and the one near his shoulder is the exit wound. Kay: Nice! I knew you could figure it out! Edgeworth: It comes with experience, and I've seen my share of crime scenes. (Speaking of experience... ...this crime scene seems a bit too clean for a murder where the bullet went clean through. I should make a note of this oddity.) Deduce pendant (after examining pendant) Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Preliminary Findings Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's something not right about the name on the pendant. The victim is the Amano family butler, and his name is \"Oliver Deacon\". But the name on the pendant is \"Colin Devorae\". Kay: I wonder what's up with that? Edgeworth: I don't know, but... ...I think we've hit upon an important piece of information. Mr. Deacon's Pendant data jotted down in my Organizer. Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence alone solves this whole case! Kay: Really!? You think so!? Because to be honest, I don't really see how it solves anything... You must be confused jumping from a kidnapping to a murder. Yeah, that's it! Edgeworth: (Nngh! I can't believe I made such a large blunder... ...that even this little girl could point it out!) Leads back to examination of body Examine evidence Mr. Deacon's Pendant Front side Edgeworth: It's the victim's pendant, which is shaped like a horse. Kay: It's got a real dignified look on its face. That makes it worth all the more... ! Oh no, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What? Did you find an important piece of evidence? Kay: This... is made of platinum silver! That makes this thing super-valuable! I've seen this type of jewelry at a lot of stores before, so I know it when I see it! Edgeworth: ............Kay, if you ever laid so much as a finger on those pieces of jewelry... Kay: Wh-What? Me? I-I'd never do something like that! Edgeworth: (......Is it possible that she has never wanted to steal from a jewelry store before?) Name on back Edgeworth: The name \"Colin Devorae\" is engraved here. Kay: I really admire people who carve their own names into a pendant. Edgeworth: Oh? And why would that be? Kay: You have no imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. Did you ever think that maybe people want to have their loved ones always nearby? Edgeworth: It's not as if I have a wedding band, and I have no interest in accessorizing. Kay: *sigh* I suppose. Anyway, you know what? More than wearing flashy accessories... ...I'd rather be engraving my name into every treasure I can find all around the world! Edgeworth: (A sign of affection is one thing, but blatant vandalizing is just a bit different.) Partner Talk The murder Edgeworth: It appears that this case has taken a turn for the unexpected. Kay: I'll say! I was shocked to open that shutter and find a dead body inside! Edgeworth: I suppose most people would be, since the average person rarely runs across a corpse. Kay: Wait! You just compared me to a \"normal person\", didn't you!? I'll have you know that I'm... Edgeworth: Sorry. I suppose I should have recognized that you're a... thief, correct? Kay: No! I'm a GREAT Thief! And a GREAT Thief is not surprised by anything! Got it!? Edgeworth: (Apparently, with GREAT thievery comes GREAT loss of short-term memory.) Present Mr. Deacon's Pendant Kay: This horse is really pretty... Edgeworth: Don't even think about it. Kay: OK, I'll just hold onto it then! Don't worry, it's safe with me! Edgeworth: (Just so we're clear, Kay, a five-finger discount is not part of the bargain.) After examining wounds and correctly deducing pendant: Investigation Complete ???: Laaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, sweetie!? Edgeworth: Excuse me, but you are...? ???: *ba-dump* Edgeworth: ? ???: Oh, this is bad... He's really good looking! Ack! Stop it, Lauren! You can't let yourself fall for a playboy like him! You're in love with... Kay: Sounds like someone doesn't know the meaning of the phrase \"inner monologue\", huh? Edgeworth: Sorry to interrupt your... conversation, but might you be a friend of Lance? ???: Yes, I'm Lance's girlfriend... My name is Lauren Paups. Edgeworth: His girlfriend...? Paups: Oh, it's not like that! We're more like friends... and, um... We're not lovers or anything! We! Well, we haven't gotten that far yet! But... I guess that's how people are going to see it, so I should just accept it... I even got this ring as a present from Lance... *swoon* Kay: Ha ha, you know what she reminds of? A cartoon character! Edgeworth: N...Nnnnrrrghn... May I inquire as to why you are here? Paups: I haven't been able to get in contact with Lance lately... ...and I began to get really worried. *sob* I looked everywhere for him, and then I heard about the kidnapping, so I came here. Kay: Wow, you're really strong for having made it through all this by yourself! Paups: Um! Is it true!? Has Lance really been kidnapped!? Edgeworth: ...No one is supposed to know, but yes, it's true. Paups: Oh, Lance...! I can't believe you've been spirited away... I wonder how you're doing right now... Kay: Looks like she's gone back to the \"fair maiden in love\" routine... So, Mr. Edgeworth, where do we go from here? Edgeworth: Well, we found a body, so we should look into the murder... ???: Lang: My men brought me up to speed over the radio. And I have to say, you really should've called. I heard you found something very intriguing. Edgeworth: I have nothing to hide, Agent Lang. It's exactly what you see before you. Lang: I'll take it from here. Yeah, that guy's really dead. Hey! You waiting for an invitation? Hurry up and detain the suspect, now. Edgeworth: (Suspect? Who...?) Lang: Officer Meekins, is it? You're coming with us. Meekins: What!? SIR! I had nothing to do with it, sir! Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Don't you think you're being a bit rash!? Do you even have a good reason to suspect Officer Meekins!? Lang: Hah, I leave that kind of stuff to you prosecutors. It's your job, after all. Like I said earlier, the crime scene isn't as forgiving as your precious courtroom. Edgeworth: That's your answer!? Lang: I know you like your logic and reasoning... ...but that sort of impractical fluff is not needed out here in the field. Edgeworth: ! Lang: All you have to do is arrest suspicious person after suspicious person. That's how you eliminate crime from the streets! Edgeworth: But that's also precisely how you unnecessarily arrest innocent people by mistake! Lang: \"Innocent people\"? Nonsense! There's no such thing as an innocent person. We've all got a blemish or two in our hearts. Edgeworth: That's tyranny! I won't allow such a thing to go on unchecked before my eyes! Lang: Heh! Too bad you don't call the shots around here! Edgeworth: As I have sworn to uphold the laws of this land, I cannot allow you to take this man in. That you would arrest a man on false charges without even conducting an investigation... ...have you no honor as a member of law enforcement!? MIB: You! How dare you speak so disrespectfully to our Shifu!? Lang: Hold it! .................. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You amuse me, Mr. Prosecutor. Lang Zi says: \"Every pack has its own rules.\" If you can play by their rules and come out on top, that is a true victory. Alright, I'll give your beloved laws a fair shake. I'll show you just how much investigating I've done... ...through my line of logic! Argument -- Shi-Long Lang's Logic -- Lang: I've seen a lot of bodies like the one being carted off in my time. I can say he was shot in a single glance, but even you figured that much out, right? With your current gun laws, it's not exactly easy to get your hands on a gun. Not unless you're a member of law enforcement like Officer Meekins, isn't that right? Edgeworth: That is your reasoning...? Lang: Solid as a rock! It's based on the philosophy of detainment! Kay: Um... What's this \"philosophy of detainment\"? Lang: Hah! You don't know!? In that case, pay attention, girlie. In my country, the criminals have a saying: \"Beware of the wolf.\" Edgeworth: Why the wolf...? Lang: Because in my language, \"lang\" means \"wolf\", and you don't mess with me or my pack. And as for the detainment philosophy, its father is my honorable ancestor, Lang Zi. Edgeworth: (Hmm... You'd think I'd have heard of him and his teachings if he is [sic] that famous...) Lang: Lang Zi developed it as he worked to lock criminals away thousands of years ago. To this day, the Zheng Fa police still trains its recruits using his philosophies. Kay: But \"thousands of years ago\"? That makes your story about as believable as a fairy tale! Edgeworth: Hmph. Anything wears down and breaks over time. Do you really believe something as ancient as that can be applied to today's world? Lang: ......You want to put it to a test? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So what can you tell me about the body? Lang: A lot. Even without an autopsy, I have my eyes. They teach you the basics of forensics along with the detention philosophy. Edgeworth: Oh? Then you wouldn't mind telling me a little of what you've figured out, correct? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Yes, I think anyone who saw the bullet wounds would come to the same conclusion. Lang: Lang: Heh, don't pat yourself on the back yet! Edgeworth: What's that supposed to mean? Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Search where the water is deepest.\" You have to keep your eyes on the big fish that lurks in the depths, which is the killer. Edgeworth: Is that right? And what would you know about the killer? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It would appear you've studied a little of our laws. Lang: Studied? Who needs to study what every child on any street corner already knows? It's that... that......... Shih-na! Shih-na: The \"Federal Firearms Restriction Act\". Lang: That's it. The Federal Firearms Restriction Act. I hear it's not easy to get a gun these days. Edgeworth: (Interesting. That woman is the one in charge of keeping track of the information.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If that's the case, there are plenty of other officers who might be potential suspects. You're not seriously going to arrest each and every one of them, are you? Lang: As if I would need to! I've already looked into everyone else here. Edgeworth: Oh? Lang: Other than Officer Meekins. I know no one else's weapon has been fired. Edgeworth: ! H-How did you check every single person's weapon in such a short span of time!? Lang: That's because each and every one of my subordinates is extremely capable. It didn't take more than a few minutes to conduct the entire investigation! Edgeworth: (The power of sheer numbers...) But you have yet to check Officer Meekins's weapon, correct? Lang: Thanks for reminding me. Hey, you! Show me your gun. Meekins: ..................Oh! Edgeworth: (What's wrong...? Why does he look so sickly pale all of a sudden?) Meekins: ............Gun! Lang: What did you say? I can't hear you. Stop mumbling and spit it out already! Meekins: Sir, sir... I LOST MY GUN, SIIIIIIIIIIR!!! Edgeworth: How could you be so irresponsible!? Lang: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! In the end, it looks like you're still the only suspect we've got. You're the one who waited here outside this garage to ambush and kill the victim! Edgeworth: (So you think that Officer Meekins waited here to kill the victim, do you, Lang? I think this little accusation deserves a lot more scrutiny.) Add statement \"Officer Meekins ambushed the victim in this garage and killed him here with his gun!\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you are implying that the murder weapon in this case is a policeman's service revolver? Lang: I don't know for sure just yet, but it's entirely possible. After all, Officer Meekins did just admit that he \"lost his gun\". Ha ha ha ha! You'd think he could come up with a better lie than that! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean to tell me that the murder occurred here, in this garage? Lang: From the fact that the suspect was found almost next to where the body was found... ...I'd say that it's pretty obvious that this is the crime scene. Lang Zi says: \"A criminal always returns to the scene of the crime.\" Kay: Hey! Finally, a quote even I've heard of before! Lang: Furthermore, Lang Zi says: \"Successful investigations are the result of multiple returns to a crime scene.\" Edgeworth: (Looks like neither detectives nor criminals have changed their ways over the millenniums.) Edgeworth: (So this is the kind of conclusion the philosophy of detainment can lead you to...) Kay: I don't get it, Mr. Edgeworth. Why are you putting yourself on the line for Mr. Meekins? Edgeworth: It's not that I particularly care about what happens to Officer Meekins. Kay: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: However, I can't simply stand by while Agent Lang ignores our country's laws. (Shi-Long Lang... Just what sort of investigator are you?)Lang: I've seen a lot of bodies like the one being carted off in my time. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So what can you tell me about the body?

Edgeworth: Unfortunately for you, Agent Lang, that is simply not possible. Lang: What do you mean? Edgeworth: You've seen the crime scene for yourself. And while you were looking, did you not think to yourself that it was a little too clean? Lang: Aiya! Edgeworth: So you did notice that there was too little blood. Do you still wish to claim that Officer Meekins committed the murder here? Because this isn't the crime scene. And if it was your men who led you to think it was... ...then I suggest you leave this case to the local police to set the record straight! Lang: Grr! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Not bad. I see your logic can be just as sound as mine. In that case, let me ask you this: Don't you think it's weird that officer was hanging out around here in the first place? Edgeworth: Weird? How so? Lang: Hey, you! Your squad's not even supposed to be in this area, right? What were you doing neglecting your duties and loafing around here? Meekins: I-I...! Lang: Don't you dare give me some lame excuse like, \"I found myself taking a walk.\" Meekins: But sir... I really did take a walk, sir! Lang: You're a disgrace. How dare you take your pack obligations so lightly? Edgeworth: (Officer Meekins is looking extra meek. Is he hiding something...?) Meekins: Mr. Edgeworth! Please! Sir! Save me the way you did earlier, please, sir! Edgeworth: ...Officer Meekins. Please give is a detailed account of what happened. Meekins: SIR! Not you, too! Testimony -- Meekins's Testimony -- Meekins: It's true, sir! I wasn't assigned to this area, sir! I was told to check every square inch of the main gate area, sir! I also went looking for the kidnappers while selling dreams in the Blue Badgermobile, sir! But! I got completely caught up in my role, selling dreams to the children! SIR! Before I knew it, I found myself here in this area, sir! Edgeworth: What is this \"Blue Badgermobile\"? Meekins: It's a moving store on wheels that sells sweet dreams and merchandise, sir! Kay: So the Blue Badgermobile is just a roaming souvenir shop? Blue Badgermobile data jotted down in my Organizer. Meekins: SIR! I swear I was chasing the kidnappers down while I was being a good dream merchant! Edgeworth: (He seems rather worked up... Even more than his usual hyperactive self.) Kay: He sure seems sure of what he's saying. Edgeworth: Can you try to calm down and lower your voice to a more reasonable level, Officer? Meekins: SIR! Roger, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Alright then, where were you assigned to? Meekins: I-I was assigned to the main gate, sir! Edgeworth: (He must mean the area with the bridge and the outrageous fountain.) Kay: OK, then why are you here in the Wild, Wild West area? Meekins: That's because! It's because of a very deep reason, ma'am! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Describe for me how you conducted your investigation. Meekins: Yes, sir! Well! First, I made sure there were no suspicious-looking people in the area, sir! But! The only people that seemed to gather around me... ...were little girls, sir! Kay: Well, what did you expect when you're dressed like the Blue Badger? Meekins: I thought I had no choice at that point, sir, so... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What exactly do you mean by \"selling dreams\"? Meekins: SIR! The Blue Badgermobile is where dreams are collected! Kay: Um, what? Meekins: Sweetness like you've never known except in dreams, ma'am, like \"Innocence Drops\". And bitterness found only in nightmares, ma'am, like \"Guilty Jawbreakers\". Selling those as I pushed the Blue Badgermobile along is my sworn duty, ma'am! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You completely forgot to look for the kidnappers? Meekins: NO, SIR! OF COURSE NOT, SIR! I! I would never do something like that, sir! Edgeworth: .................. Meekins: ..................Umm... You're absolutely riiiiiiiight! Kay: Wow, you're good at this forcing-people-to-confess thing, Mr. Edgeworth! Meekins: To be frank, I'm just a little man, sir... I'm better at selling kids a few small dreams than looking for a big crook, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Enough wallowing in your own self-pity. Let's return to your testimony. Meekins: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did you wind up all the way over here? Meekins: I was in the middle of a sea of kids, sir... But one of the kids decided to challenge me to a fight, sir! I had to run away from the child's painful dropkicks, and before I knew it... Kay: Ha ha, the good ol' dropkick! I dished out my fair share of those when I was a kid! It was always the best when you felt one really connect with your opponent! Edgeworth: In any case, you wound up here for a reason completely unrelated to the investigation? Meekins: SIR! That's right, sir! Edgeworth: ...That's not something you should be admitting to with your head held high, Officer. Edgeworth: (It sounds like he simply forgot about his real job and became the Blue Badger... However, there is one flaw in Officer Meekins's story. But I have the feeling that he'll need some prodding before he'll spill the beans.)Oldbag: I came to this stadium to take a short break. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean you took a break from being the Pink Badger? Oldbag: You may not think it, but it's hard work keeping kids' dreams alive. You smell of sweat, your hip creaks with pain -- you even begin to dream about work. Kay: That's the kind of story that would scar a child for life, you know... Oldbag: Well, that's why I chose to come take my break here, whippersnapper! I don't plan on playing the part of the Dead Badger in front of a bunch of kids! Edgeworth: So what did you see while you, the Pink Badger, were resting? Oldbag: Oh, yes, that! Well! Oldbag: As I was resting, I happened to glance over and I saw two men facing each other in that area. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You saw two men...? Can you describe them for me? Oldbag: They looked like your average Joes, completely uninteresting and not worth fawning over. I'm telling you, they were so boring that I don't even remember much beyond that. Edgeworth: But did they have any special features? Anything you can recall would be very helpful. Oldbag: Oh, my! Don't tell me you're jealous of those two men! Kay: Hey, she's right. You do seem pretty worked-up over them, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: I-I'm not worked up over anyone! A-And I'm not jealous! Oldbag: It's alright, Edgey-poo. Those two were just foals compared to a stallion like you. I thought so little of them that I lost interest the instant I laid eyes on them. Oldbag: Suddenly, there was a loud gunshot, and the person who was shot fell to the ground. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You're claiming to have seen the exact moment in which the murder took place? Oldbag: Absolutely! That gun made a terrible racket when it was fired. Kay: You didn't try to go help the person that got shot? Oldbag: I'm only one person, you smart-alecky brat! What could I have done!? But I took off as soon as I could to find someone who could help. Oldbag: It was a very terrifying experience, let me tell you! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: .................. Oldbag: .................. Well, don't you have anything to say to me!? Edgeworth: No, not especially. Oldbag: You're so cold, Edgey-poo. But... that is exactly what I like about you. Kay: You sure are one tough cookie! One part unshakable, and one part scary... Oldbag: Watch that smart mouth of yours, missy! What do you know about my fragile heart!? Edgeworth: (I can tell this is an important piece of testimony, but she's rather vague in a few spots. *sigh* I suppose this means I'm going to have to talk with her some more...) After pressing second and third statements: Edgeworth: (Two men, one bullet... It's all consistent with what we found out from the body.) Sadly, there wasn't exactly a lot of new information to go on in your testimony... Oldbag: Well, if I saw the guy again, I'm sure I could identify him for you! I mean, how do you expect me to remember anything without something to jog my memory!? Kay: Self-centered, aren't we? Edgeworth: While it was somewhat useful, her testimony also presents us with a new problem... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: So, about this new problem... Edgeworth: What is that giant grin on your face for? Kay: Do you want me to show you something really nice? Edgeworth: ...No, thank you. Kay: Don't be so mean! I swear it's something you're going to like! Edgeworth: What is that gadget you're holding? Kay: What you see before you is the secret weapon of a Great Thief! Edgeworth: ...Ahh, I should have known it would be worthless. Kay: Aww, don't be like that! Tee hee. *ahem!* What do you think now!? Edgeworth: What is it doing...? It's projecting something into the air... Kay: I'm going to input the necessary information to run the simulation now. Once I'm done, I'll increase the size of the projection to its maximum size... Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood! Re-creation Edgeworth: Wh-What is this!? Kay: This is a re-creation of the murder based on the info I inputted into Little Thief! Edgeworth: L-Little Thief? I dare say I think you're taking the Robin Hood thing a bit too far... Kay: Little Thief is actually meant to be a simulator for me to plan my thefts. But I suppose if I used it like this... Let's see... Ms. Oldbag said that the two men were facing each other. And then, a gunshot rang out, and the victim fell to the ground... Edgeworth: Ah... So with this, we can inspect the crime scene as it was in the past. Kay: See! So, what do you think? Edgeworth: I have to say, I'm impressed by the technology thieves have access to these days. Kay: Well, it IS the super-secret weapon of the mighty Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: Indeed. Kay: Oh, but if there isn't enough information, or if something is out of place... ...the re-creation could come out a little strange. Edgeworth: In other words, I can use this to authenticate the validity of a witness's testimony? Kay: You got it! You really catch on quick, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Right now, this simulation is a re-creation of that witness's testimony... So for now, I should re-examine everything... ...and if I find anything illogical or strange, I can then ask for clarification.) Kay: Feel free to examine anything in this simulation in the way you always do! You can even present evidence when you find a contradiction! And if you find something, I've got Little Thief with me, so you just let me know, OK? Begin Investigation Stadium Talk Ema Skye Ema: This is amazing! Just FEEL the power of science! Wendy Oldbag Oldbag: What is this? Some sort of new attraction? Examine Victim Leads to: \"According to the testimony, the victim fell to the ground here...\" Stage Edgeworth: It looks like they broke the stage down (Stage was packed up - The stage I saw this morning in the center of this stadium has been packed away.). Kay: I guess this means they're done for the day... Edgeworth: Or maybe it's because a different show is scheduled to start its run tomorrow. Killer Edgeworth: (It's the silhouette of the killer with his gun at the ready.) Kay, is it not possible to re-create the face of the killer? Kay: Well, I can't exactly input what we don't know into Little Thief. Edgeworth: (She has a point...) Partner Talk Re-creation Edgeworth: So, you believe that this gadget will provide us with the proof we need? Kay: Yeah, of course! Pretty neat, huh? By inputting info like this, it can re-create the crime scene exactly as it was. Although, Little Thief was originally intended to be a training sim for heists... Edgeworth: A training sim for thievery!? I don't believe I can turn a deaf ear to that, Kay. Kay: Bah, it's for practice! Practice! It's not like I've actually stolen anything yet! Besides, we're in the middle of an investigation! So stop nit-picking! Edgeworth: Even if it is just \"practice\", I can't exactly endorse the act of stealing. Although, admittedly, this device is rather useful in an investigation. Using Little Thief (appears after \"Re-creation\") Edgeworth: So, how am I supposed to use this to aid my investigation...? Kay: Oh! That's right! I guess I should explain how to use it, huh? Objects outlined in yellow are things that are not present in our time, but were in the past. Things outlined in a dotted line are things that exist now, but didn't in the past. Edgeworth: I see... Kay: You can examine and interact with replicated people and objects as you normally do. You can even present evidence whenever you find an inconsistency. Oh, and be sure to point out mistakes in the re-creation with evidence, too! Edgeworth: Hmm... Very well, let's continue with the investigation. Kay: If there's something you don't get about Little Thief, feel free to ask anytime, OK? Edgeworth: According to the testimony, the victim fell to the ground here... Kay: That's right. But...? Edgeworth: But, if that's the case, then we've already found our first contradiction. Kay: Huh? What? Where!? Edgeworth: If this is the real scene of the crime, there's something missing that should be here. Which piece of evidence shows the missing item? Present Mr. Deacon's Murder Notes Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is the contradiction!\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Kay: .................. Maybe you're still adjusting to the simulation...? Edgeworth: ...Y-Yes, that's it. Allow me to find my bearings, and I'll present the contradiction again. (Maybe I need to review the evidence again. It should go without saying that the truth lies in what is missing from this scene!) Leads back to: \"Which piece of evidence shows the missing item?\" Edgeworth: This is the contradiction! Kay: Eh? Is something wrong with my re-creation? Edgeworth: If this is the real scene of the crime, something specific should be here. If you think back, how did we deduce that the other crime scene was not the real one? Kay: Oh! I get what's missing now! There's no blood on the ground here either, right? Edgeworth: Right. The fact that there is no blood here casts doubt on the witness's testimony. Oldbag: Edgey-poooooooo! How can you doubt me like that!? Are you calling me a liar!? I know what I saw! And I saw the victim get shot down! Kay: You know, I don't think she's lying, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (To be honest, I can't think of a reason why she would lie to me. In that case, maybe there is another explanation for the distinct lack of blood (Why is there no blood? - Why is there no blood around the victim's prone body?).) Examine Victim Edgeworth: (Now I'm fairly convinced that the victim was killed here. But then why is there no blood? There must be some explanation for this contradiction! Perhaps I should go over all of the information I've gathered one more time...) Logic Connect \"Victim was kidnapper?\" and \"Why is there no blood?\" Leads to: \"Is it not possible that the victim was wearing a costume?\" Edgeworth: Is it not possible that the victim was wearing a costume? Kay: So you really think that Mr. Deacon was one of the kidnappers? Edgeworth: I think we can reasonably assume there is a very good chance that he was. And that if he was [sic] shot while he was inside one of those stolen costumes... Kay: ...Then Mr. Deacon's blood would be inside the costume instead of on the ground! Edgeworth: Precisely. Now, if only we could prove that the victim was wearing a costume... Kay: You'd think it'd be pretty easy if we could find some footprints... ...but the problem is FINDING them, since there doesn't seem to be any around. Edgeworth: (Footprints, huh...? I wonder how we can go about finding some of those...?) Talk Ema Skye Footprint analysis Leads to: \"Ema, about that method you were talking about for finding footprints...\" Examine Victim Edgeworth: (Was the victim really wearing a costume? Maybe we can find out if we did some footprint analysis forensics...) Edgeworth: Ema, about that method you were talking about for finding footprints... Ema: Ah, finally my expert knowledge in forensics is needed! Edgeworth: Yes, well... Can you detect and trace even partial footprints? Ema: Leave it to me! My cutting-edge detection kit can find anything! Edgeworth: Very well. If you could please analyze the footprints in this area... Ema: OK! Stand back now, and witness the power of science at work! Ema: Hey! I found something! Look, right here! Edgeworth: ? I don't see anything... Ema: Oh, that's right! Here, put these special glasses on, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ! These footprints here were definitely left by a Badger costume! Ema: Judging by the way the prints are layered, those seem to be the newest. Edgeworth: (Then... we can conclude that the victim was definitely wearing a costume at the time.) Victim's Costume data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: OK! In that case, I'll update Little Thief's simulation parameters! I can't wait to see what we find out from this new info! Re-creation Investigation Complete Edgeworth: So the victim was wearing a costume when he died. Kay: And with that, we should be one step closer to the truth, right? Edgeworth: (Hmm... I see the re-creation has changed in accordance with the new information.) We may be closer, but now, something else has caught my attention. Oldbag: What do you want? Edgeworth: Your testimony, naturally. I'd like to hear it one more time, if you please. Testimony -- What Oldbag Witnessed -- Oldbag: I came to this stadium to take a short break. As I was resting, I happened to glance over and I saw two men facing each other in that area. Suddenly, there was a loud gunshot, and the person who was shot fell to the ground. It was a very terrifying experience, let me tell you! Kay: So! Does this mean that Ms. Oldbag's testimony has a contradiction in it? Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe our best course of action is to compare it with your re-creation. Kay: See! I just KNEW Little Thief would be of help! Now let's see if we can pull more info from Ms. Oldbag to put into the re-creation! Edgeworth: For that, we must first find the contradiction in her testimony. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean you took a break from being the Pink Badger? Oldbag: You may not think it, but it's hard work keeping kids' dreams alive. You smell of sweat, your hip creaks with pain -- you even begin to dream about work. Kay: That's the kind of story that would scar a child for life, you know... Oldbag: Well, that's why I chose to come take my break here, whippersnapper! I don't plan on playing the part of the Dead Badger in front of a bunch of kids! Edgeworth: So what did you see while you, the Pink Badger, were resting? Oldbag: Oh, yes, that! Well! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You saw two men...? Can you describe them for me? Oldbag: They looked like your average Joes, completely uninteresting and not worth fawning over. I'm telling you, they were so boring that I don't even remember much beyond that. Edgeworth: But did they have any special features? Anything you can recall would be very helpful. Oldbag: Oh, my! Don't tell me you're jealous of those two men! Kay: Hey, she's right. You do seem pretty worked-up over them, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: I-I'm not worked up over anyone! A-And I'm not jealous! Oldbag: It's alright, Edgey-poo. Those two were just foals compared to a stallion like you. I thought so little of them that I lost interest the instant I laid eyes on them. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You're claiming to have seen the exact moment in which the murder took place? Oldbag: Absolutely! That gun made a terrible racket when it was fired. Kay: You didn't try to go help the person that got shot? Oldbag: I'm only one person, you smart-alecky brat! What could I have done!? But I took off as soon as I could to find someone who could help. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: .................. Oldbag: .................. Well, don't you have anything to say to me!? Edgeworth: No, not especially. Oldbag: You're so cold, Edgey-poo. But... that is exactly what I like about you. Kay: You sure are one tough cookie! One part unshakable, and one part scary... Oldbag: Watch that smart mouth of yours, missy! What do you know about my fragile heart!? Edgeworth: Knowing what we know now, thanks to your re-creation... Kay: ...The contradiction stands out like a giant sore thumb! Edgeworth: Precisely. It's all becoming clear to me. Let's clear up this issue with some well-presented evidence, and get this over with.Oldbag: I came to this stadium to take a short break.

Edgeworth: Two men? How did you know the gender of the two people involved... ...seeing as how the victim was wearing a costume at the time!? Oldbag: Ah! Edgeworth: Furthermore, I have another matter I'd like to inquire about! I'd very much like to know... ...why you failed to mention the costume in your testimony!? Oldbag: Uwah! Edgeworth: I'm beginning to doubt if you really witnessed the murder at all. Oldbag: But I'm telling you, I really did see it! I saw it with my very own eyes! .........From a seat in the second tier. Edgeworth: The second tier...? Kay: Hey, didn't you say you saw it \"right in front of you\" earlier? Oldbag: That was... you know... I was using the phrase in the metaphorical sense...? Edgeworth: (*sigh* I see our witness still has a screw loose, in the metaphorical sense.) Oldbag: The cushy seats in the second tier are reserved for hot-shot VIPs. Which is exactly why I go there now and again to take a nap! Kay: I can't see how you could've gotten a good look from there. It's so high up! Edgeworth: Were you able to see even the victim's costume from way up there? Oldbag: Well, I know I saw two people. But I couldn't really see what they looked like because they were in the stage's shadow (In the shadow of the stage - It was hard to make out the killer and victim that Oldbag saw in the stage's shadow.). My eyesight isn't what it used to be, you know. Not like when I was young. Ah, people used to call me \"Eagle-Eyed Wendy\" back then! could spot a good man from 100 paces away as I walked down the street, just like that! Of course, they also noticed me in a flash and tried to make their move. But I'm not that easy! I was a careful girl with a judgmental eye! But I never let a good man slip me by, you bet I didn't! If you could've seen Edgeworth: *sigh* Let's return to our investigation, shall we, Kay? Kay: You got it! Begin Investigation Stadium Talk Ema Skye Footprint analysis Edgeworth: Thanks to you, I'm able to proceed with my investigation once again. Thank you. Ema: Ah, it was nothing! I'm just glad that science and I could be of service! Kay: Pretty amazing how we could see the footprints. So what's the secret behind that thing? Ema: Oh, you want to know? Um... here, you can read the manual! Kay: Aha... Very interesting... So if I do this, I can avoid leaving footprints... Edgeworth: (She can't seriously be trying to use the information to her advantage as a thief... Wait...) Examine Victim Edgeworth: (This new silhouette of the victim is in a costume.) Kay: The silhouettes can change depending on the information I input. But Little Thief can re-create more than just people... So investigate away! We may even find more info with which to make a more accurate sim! Edgeworth: Alright. Sounds like a plan. Logic Connect \"Stage was packed up\" and \"In the shadow of the stage\" Leads to: \"If that woman's testimony is to be believed...\" Edgeworth: If that woman's testimony is to be believed... ...the murder occurred before the stage was broken down. Kay: Do you want me to input that bit of info into Little Thief? Edgeworth: Yes, if you please. Kay: OK! Re-creation Examine Killer Leads to: \"There is clearly...\" Sign Edgeworth: \"Battle of the Magicians: Max Galactica versus Troupe Gramarye\"... And tomorrow, there will be a concert by the \"hip\" new rock band, the Gavinners. Not that either of these stage shows interest me in the least. Bottom side of stage Kay: Hey, there's a mic up there! What kind of ninja is the Jammin' Ninja? He's no slouch, no way, you betcha!♪ You're the best, Jammin' Ninja! Everyone's always trying to thank ya!♪ How was that? Edgeworth: How was what? Kay: You know what would be really awesome? If we put a band together! I can see it now! A Great Thief and a Prosecutor, stealing the hearts of millions around the world! Edgeworth: The only instruments I can play are the flute and the piano... Kay: You can play the flute while playing the piano!? That's really fresh! Edgeworth: How many hands do (changed from [to] in the original release, correcting the typo) you think I have!? Besides, I haven't even agreed to anything yet! Edgeworth: There is clearly... Kay: ...A contradiction here! Edgeworth: Please stop stealing my lines! Kay: Oh, come on. It wasn't that hard to see it coming, even for a layman like me! Edgeworth: I suppose. In any case, it's not possible for the killer to have stood here in that way... ...because there was a very real stage set up in this spot at that time. Kay: Yeesh, I told you I got it! Do you feel the need to explain everything!? Edgeworth: Yes, well... In any case, we still need to resolve this unusual situation. Kay: Isn't it obvious? The killer was on top of the stage, naturally. Right, Ms. Oldbag!? Oldbag: Yes! I remember now! The killer was standing on top of the stage! Kay: See! Now let me update the info in the simulation. Re-creation Investigation Complete Lang: Well, well, what have we here? A bunch of hooligans running amok, I see! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, how nice of you to join us. Lang: Well, I can't have you going around messing up my crime scenes. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, we've discovered that the real scene of the murder is here, the stadium. Lang: I see. Thanks. Edgeworth: For what? Lang: I'm just trying to show you my appreciation for all the time you saved me. Who knew that such a strange little toy could re-create a crime scene like that. Kay: Little Thief is NOT a toy! Lang: ...You two! Sir! Lang: And there you have it. You see? Big boys like me don't need silly toys, little girl. Kay: *sigh* Lang: Now THIS is a re-creation. Edgeworth: So what? Do you still intend to assert that Officer Meekins is the killer? Lang: Of course. Even knowing that the crime took place here doesn't let him off the hook. Argument -- Agent Lang's Logic -- Lang: This is the real scene of the crime. Officer Meekins lay in wait for the victim on top of the stage. And when the victim finally showed, he shot him from on high! That's the truth your little re-creation showed. Edgeworth: How far will you go to accuse Officer Meekins of the crime...? Lang: He's the most likely suspect we've got, especially given the situation with his gun. Kay: Well, even if he is the killer, at least my re-creation was on the mark. Lang: You see? Thank you for understanding, my little crow-girl. Kay: Grr... I'm not some common crow! I'm the Yatagarasu! The raven of legend! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, your conclusion has yet to be tested, so let's see how well it holds up. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Looks like we found the real crime scene first. Lang: Ha! Brag all you want, but we don't have all that free time, unlike the two of you. Kay: Heh heh. You know what you remind me of? A dog licking his wounds as he whimpers home! Lang: Well, I guess I should be thankful for all the time you saved me. Xie xie. That's how we say \"thanks\" in my country. Edgeworth: Y-You're welcome. (I hope he realizes we didn't do all of this for him...) Lang: But I'm here now, so I'll be taking over! As I was saying, this is where the crime took place. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Lying in wait? How did Officer Meekins even know the victim was going to come here? Lang: Simple. He was investigating the kidnappers, right? And while he was doing so, he came to understand the victim, Mr. Deacon's movements. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hah! And why would the good officer want to ambush and kill a kidnapper? Lang: Lang: You mean his motive? Who knows, and who cares. You can find that out for yourself when you talk to him in jail. Edgeworth: Hmph. You have no respect for the order of law. Lang: Don't get me wrong, but I need more than \"There's no motive!\" to convince me otherwise. Edgeworth: (He's right. The lack of a motive is a rather weak argument by itself.) Lang: So, the officer lay in wait on top of the stage... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you agree with how our re-creation turned out...? Lang: Like I said, I'm grateful that you were able to save me some time. Edgeworth: Alright, but we still don't know why he chose to wait on top of the stage. Lang: Who cares. Maybe he wanted to become the Blue Badger. Who's to say he didn't see the stage and decided to put on a Badger stage show of his own? Edgeworth: (Or maybe there's a completely different reason...?) Lang: What does it matter!? It still doesn't change the fact that Officer Meekins... ...stood up on that stage and shot the victim on the ground below. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you honestly believe that what you're saying is what really occurred? Lang: Hey, you're the ones who came up with this scenario. Are you saying you doubt yourselves? Edgeworth: Nnngh... Touché... Edgeworth: Unfortunately, Agent Lang's conclusions do not contradict with our re-creation. Kay: Hmm... Then, does that mean it all went down just as he says? Edgeworth: No, not quite. (I wonder if what we had re-created earlier was the whole truth?)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Dick Gumshoe\nDescription: Homicide detective at the local precinct.

I'm counting on you for backup. Gumshoe: You can count on me, sir! Edgeworth: I have to go. The kidnapper is supposed to contact me soon. (Who would've thought that upon my return, I'd be thrust into a kidnapping case. And that I would be the one who would have to make the ransom drop-off...) Edgeworth: (Let's see... I checked that the money is all there, safe inside this suitcase... Now all I have to do is await further instructions from the kidnapper... ...which I'm expecting to be transferred to my cell phone. I wonder who else is around? This is the meeting place, after all...) ???: Welcome to Gatewater Land! Edgeworth: Hm? Oh, thank you. ???: And a big hello to you! I'm the Proto Badger! Nice to meet you! ............ Edgeworth: ............ Proto B.: Excuse me, but were you perhaps thinking of taking a picture of me? Edgeworth: A picture...? Of you...? Sorry, but I'm not interested.

(I was hoping for an exchange, but maybe I should do as they say for now and not push it.) Edgeworth: (I couldn't catch even a glimpse of the kidnapper. Perhaps I should keep an eye on this haunted house until police backup arrives.) Edgeworth: (Agh! It was a trap!) March 13, 11:23 AM ???????????? Examine evidence Prosecutor's Badge Front of badge Edgeworth: This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so. Back of badge Edgeworth: Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else! ???: That guy... betrayed... ???: No... can't be... Then the deal... Edgeworth: (Who is that...?

Edgeworth: Where am I...? (How long was I out...? It wasn't raining like it is now when I made the drop-off... This was supposed to be a simple affair... ...so why have I been taken hostage as well!? I can only assume Detective Gumshoe lost sight of me at some point.) Edgeworth: The only reason I agreed to be the drop-off man was because of that phone call. It was from Mr. Ernest Amano, the director of the powerful zaibatsu, the Amano Group. But aside from that, I also owe him a great debt of gratitude. His only son, Lance, had been kidnapped. I know that Lance is already in his twenties, but I guess some things you never grow out of. Edgeworth: .................. (I can't sit around waiting for someone to come help me! I must escape somehow...) ...Nnnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!! ???: Hahaha! Was that you making that funny sound!? Edgeworth: ............Who's there!? And how dare you laugh at a gentleman's plight!? ...Who are you? Are you one of the kidnappers? ???: A kidnapper? Me? No way! I'm not into such petty crimes. Nope! I'm after something much, much bigger! Edgeworth: .................. (Argh! I must be worn out from today's ordeal. Focus, Miles!) ???: Oh, I forgot to introduce myself! Sorry about that! Ahem! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: Great Thief? (And did she really just claim to be the Yatagarasu?) Kay: Oh, but my real name is Kay Faraday. You can call me \"Kay\", 'kay!? Good! Glad that's settled! Edgeworth: .................. Not quite. I have a mountain of questions for you... ...but first, if you would be so kind as to remove these ropes. Kay: Hmm... I wonder... Should I remove them? I was actually having a lot of fun watching you make those silly faces... Edgeworth: .................. Kay: Hey! There's no need to get all mad and icy glare-y on me, you know! This rope goes through here, and... there you go! Edgeworth: What a relief. I owe you my thanks. Kay: Ah, it's OK. You can pay me back in full later! Edgeworth: (Now then... What question should I start with? Unfortunately, I can already tell nothing is going to be easy with this cheeky girl...) Talk Great Thief Edgeworth: You call yourself a Great Thief, yet are you really a thief at all? Kay: You doubt me? I get it! You think that a young lady like me couldn't possibly be such a big-time thief, right? Edgeworth: (That's... not the part I have a tough time believing...) Kay: I am the real, genuine Yatagarasu, you know. Yup! I'm a pure-blooded Great Thief! It's a little something I inherited from my predecessor. Edgeworth: In that case... you wouldn't mind if I arrested you then, right? Kay: What!? Of course I'd mind! I haven't stolen anything yet! Seriously, I don't know how you can (changed from [can you] in the original release, correcting the typo) say such a horrible thing to your savior! Edgeworth: (That's true. Technically, she hasn't stolen anything in front of me... yet.) Yatagarasu (appears after \"Great Thief\") Edgeworth: When you say you're the \"Yatagarasu\", do you mean you are THE Yatagarasu...? Kay: Yup! The most righteous of the righteous! The legendary Great Thief! But I inherited the title only recently (changed from [the title was only recently succeeded to me] in the original release)... ...so I haven't had a chance to steal anything yet as the second Yatagarasu. Edgeworth: (I was not aware that thieves could pass down their titles like that...) Kay: But don't worry! I've got some big plans in the works! Edgeworth: Big plans, huh? They wouldn't happen to lead to a big arrest, would they? Kay: I knew it! There's just no reasoning with a prosecutor. Edgeworth: I'm not the problem here! Kay: I'll have you know that the Yatagarasu has no interest in stealing petty trinkets! There's one thing and only one thing I want to steal! Edgeworth: (Only one thing? And what would that be?) Kay: But that's going to have to wait until we find our way out of here! Edgeworth: Well, at least there is one thing we agree on. I'm sure I'll have plenty of time later to learn more about you. Present Anything Kay: Don't surprise me like that! I can't believe you're just shoving things in my face! I mean, aren't there more pressing things you'd rather ask little ol' me? Edgeworth: (She has a point... I should probably find out more about my mysterious savior first.) After clearing \"Yatagarasu\" Talk option: Kay: So, you never told me what your name is, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: Ah, I guess not. I'm Miles Edgeworth. Kay: Aha! Now I remember! Edgeworth: (...How can you \"remember\" something I just told you...? But she sure is cheery.) Kay: Alright, then Mr. Edgeworth, let's get outta here! ............Hm? Edgeworth: ...It would seem that we are locked in from the other side. Kay: What!? No way! I don't hear you! La la la! Edgeworth: Kay, you do remember where you came in from, right...? It looks like that might be our only way out of this room... Kay: Whoops, slight miscalculation. That's a good height to make an entrance from, but I can't jump that high to make an exit! Edgeworth: ...*sigh* I suppose we have no choice but to look around and see if we can't find another way out. Begin Investigation Isolation Room Talk Kay Faraday Present anything Kay: Hey! Don't you think getting out of here is more important right now!? You can ask me about that later! Edgeworth: (I suppose she's right...) Examine Cell phone Leads to: \"Hm? Isn't this my phone?\" Lockers Kay: Man! Why did they have to put the windows so high up, anyway!? How is a thief supposed to make her daring escape!? Edgeworth: I suppose we could make our way out if we were able to climb on top of these lockers. Kay: Haha! That's pretty clever! You'd make a good thief yet, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Please don't ever place my name and the word \"thief\" in the same sentence again. Kay: Let's see... I wonder if I can jump and grab the top of the locker here... Man! Why did they have to make such ginormous lockers, anyway!? Edgeworth: (Even if we wanted to use these lockers, we'd need some sort of foothold (Lockers - If we can get to the top, then we can escape. If only there were some footholds...)...) Boxes Kay: Hey! There's something inside the bottom-right box. Oh, I think it's a Pink Badger costume! Edgeworth: Pink Badger...? Kay: You don't keep up with what's going on in the world, do you? In that case, you'd better study up on the whole Badger clan with this! Edgeworth: What is this thing? Kay: Think of it as a bible of all the things you'll ever need to know about the clan! Edgeworth: (...Whatever. I suppose I can keep it as a reference guide or something.) Blue Badger Bible data jotted down in my Organizer. Edgeworth: I suppose this means that this is where they keep all the costumes? Kay: It certainly looks that way! It's like the Badger family's home! Edgeworth: (There are eight boxes, but seven of them are empty. Which means that seven of the costumes (Costumes - It seems that the costumes of the Badger family are kept in the Isolation Room.) are in use right now.) But aren't these Badgers the mascots of the police force? Kay: Well, I heard that the police had a hand in sponsoring this theme park. Probably because the Gatewater Group owes the police from all those cases they solved. Edgeworth: They have all the power of the state, and they used it to make a theme park!? Kay: It's not just any theme park! They have a handcuff-shaped, double-looping roller coaster... Edgeworth: That's quite enough. I'm feeling woozy from just the thought of such a thing. (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Key Edgeworth: And what have we here...? Kay: Ah! .................. Edgeworth: (Why do I feel a laser-like stare aimed right at me?) D-Did you want to take a look? Kay: Well, don't mind if I do! Ooh! I see! Yes, this is definitely...! A key (Tiny key - I may be able to open something, somewhere in this room with this key.)! I'm sure it's a key to something! Edgeworth: The \"something\" is what is relevant to my interest... Blue Badger boxes Kay: Look! It's the Blue Badger! Edgeworth: (I suppose even this thing can be popular with women.) Kay: My nemesis (changed from [I can't stand him] in the original release)! Edgeworth: Wh-What in the...!? (Why is she beating it (changed from [suddenly beating the Blue Badger's image] in the original release) up!?) Kay: He's got the word \"badge\" right in his name! That [sic] nothing but bad news for someone like me! (changed from [How bad is that for a girl like me!?] in the original release) And to think he's out there wandering around in this park... I'd better be careful, or he's going to arrest me by the power of his name alone! Edgeworth: (I somehow doubt that the Blue Badger has the power to arrest anyone.) Bad Badger boxes Edgeworth: So this is the Blue Badger's rival, the Bad Badger, huh. Do you feel some sort of reverence towards this Badger, Kay? Kay: ...Hah! I can't believe you would be so stereotypical when it comes to thieves! Surely you must also think there are much cooler, and cuter ones out there, right? That's it! I've decided that thieves and thievery need an image makeover! Edgeworth: (...Good luck with that one.) Proto Badger boxes Edgeworth: This is that Blue Badger I met at the main gate. Kay: Excuse me, but his name is \"Proto Badger\", not \"Blue Badger\"! He's based off of the very first design created by the local police chief. You know, when you compare the two, the Blue Badger looks a bit cuter! Edgeworth: I suppose as he continued to redesign him, the chief managed to make him cuter and cuter. Even humanity has come a long way when you think about how much we've evolved. Kay: Are we comparing the Blue Badger to humans now...? Pink Badger boxes Edgeworth: I suppose this is the Pink Badger? But since it has the same design, doesn't it seem forced to call this one a female? Kay: You think so? I mean, just look at how long her eyelashes are! Edgeworth: That's the only difference. Kay: And the fact that she's pink. Edgeworth: Yes, and? Kay: And her lips are red! See, lipstick! Edgeworth: .................. (What? She has nothing to say about the giant pink ribbon, or is that too obvious?) Boxes (subsequent times) Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Boxes (subsequent times, after examining key) Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Beam Edgeworth: This is the beam I was tied to. ............ Kay: Hm? What's up? Edgeworth: I was pondering if perhaps we could make it over to and out the window if we climbed this. Kay: Good thinking! And if it's climbing action you need, just leave it to me! Edgeworth: Thanks. This little hook looks like it might make for a good foothold. Up you go, Kay, and good luck! Kay: Count on it! The Great Thief Yatagarasu spreads her mighty wings, and takes to the skies! Here I go! Kay: ............ Edgeworth: As I thought, this beam (The beam I was tied to - There is a hook on this beam, but it's not enough of a foothold to climb out with.) was definitely not made for climbing. Kay: What do you mean, \"As I thought\"!? I'm not your guinea pig, you know! Beam (subsequent times) Edgeworth: This is the beam I was tied to. ............ Just maybe, we can use this to climb up to and out the window. Kay: Leave it to me! ...............Wait. Didn't I just try this!? I can't climb this thing! Edgeworth: (I suppose we'll just have to find another way to escape.) Bad Badger head Edgeworth: What is this...? Kay: Looks like the Bad Badger, and it's looking as bad as ever! Edgeworth: Looks like a costume head to me. Kay: I guess the Bad Badger's costume is, at the very least, a two-piece, huh. Edgeworth: (The real question is, why is only the head sitting out here on the floor?) Bad Badger's Head data jotted down in my Organizer. Bad Badger head (subsequent times) Edgeworth: What is this...? Kay: Looks like the Bad Badger, and it's looking as bad as ever! Edgeworth: Looks like a costume head to me. Kay: I guess the Bad Badger's costume is, at the very least, a two-piece, huh. Edgeworth: (The real question is, why is only the head sitting out here on the floor?) Paint cans Kay: Maybe we can use this paint to help us escape... Edgeworth: And what exactly do you have in mind? Kay: Well, we could paint \"HELP\" in really giant letters! Edgeworth: And who, pray tell, would see these giant letters? We're inside a building. Kay: OK, then how about we light the paint on fire and send out colored smoke signals! Anyone who saw it would think some crazy arsonist was about, and call the cops! Hmm... Actually, that may not be all that great for me, seeing as I'm a thief and all. Edgeworth: ...Let's try to find something other than this paint to use, shall we? Photo rally sign Edgeworth: They're holding a Blue Badger photo rally? Kay: You didn't know? Plus, it's not just the Blue Badger, it's his whole family, too. If you manage to snap a shot of every member of the family, you get a really posh prize. Edgeworth: Well, there's a costume head sitting over there. Why not start with a picture of that? Kay: You can't do that! That's cheating! There's only one of each Badger in the park, so you have to work for it! Edgeworth: Speaking of Badgers, there was one sitting against a wall in the haunted house. Kay: Seriously? But somehow, I don't think that one counts, Mr. Edgeworth! You have to take pictures of the costumed ones walking around the park! Edgeworth: (Hmm... So these are the rules of this game? How quaint...) Badger Photo Rally data jotted down in my Organizer. Photo rally sign (subsequent times) Edgeworth: They're holding a Blue Badger photo rally? Kay: You didn't know? Plus, it's not just the Blue Badger, it's his whole family, too. If you manage to snap a shot of every member of the family, you get a really posh prize. Edgeworth: Well, there's a costume head sitting over there. Why not start with a picture of that? Kay: You can't do that! That's cheating! There's only one of each Badger in the park, so you have to work for it! Edgeworth: Speaking of Badgers, there was one sitting against a wall in the haunted house. Kay: Seriously? But somehow, I don't think that one counts, Mr. Edgeworth! You have to take pictures of the costumed ones walking around the park! Edgeworth: (Hmm... So these are the rules of this game? How quaint...) Door Edgeworth: Nnrgh... It seems that we won't be able to open this by ourselves. It also seems quite thick, so we can't just break it down. (There must be another way out of here.) Edgeworth: (Hm? Isn't this my phone? It looks like it made it through the ordeal intact.) Kay: If only there was [sic] a way for us to contact someone on the outside... Edgeworth: Ah, but we do have a way... right here. Kay: Ah! There was a cell phone here this whole time!? Edgeworth: If I'm right, Detective Gumshoe should have contacted the precinct for backup by now. Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Are you OK!? I was so worried, sir! Edgeworth: I'm fine. I was knocked unconscious for a spell by the kidnapper, that's all. Gumshoe: I'm sorry, sir! I'm such a failure! If only I hadn't lost sight of you...! Edgeworth: Detective, we don't have time for this. Have the police set up a perimeter right now! Gumshoe: You don't have to worry about that, sir! I already got the boys working on that! But in doing that... I sorta... Aaaah...! Edgeworth: What's wrong, Detective? ???: ...Sorry to butt in, but I'm afraid you're going to have to make do (changed from [make due] in the original release, correcting the typo) with me. Edgeworth: Who is this? Lang: Shi-Long Lang of Interpol. A pleasure to speak with you, Mr. Edgeworth. I've heard a great deal about you. Edgeworth: So why exactly is an Interpol agent like yourself involved in a domestic kidnapping case? Lang: Don't sweat the details. A crime's a crime whether it's on a local or a global scale. Besides... ...you're the one who's in a world of trouble. Edgeworth: A-And why would you say that!? Lang: Lang Zi says: \"The pack that runs together, stays together.\" You catch my drift? You caused quite a ruckus by running blindly into a situation and then getting caught. Edgeworth: Tsk...! Lang: You should've contacted the police from the very beginning. Edgeworth: I'm sorry that this happened because of a lapse in judgement. However, I humbly request that you please help me out of here posthaste. Lang: ......Sorry, no can do. Edgeworth: What!? Lang: We're hunting the kidnapper now, and I haven't got any hands to spare. As I said, my pack moves as one. You're the one who wanted to go it alone, so good luck to you... Mr. Prosecutor. Oh, and once we do catch the kidnapper, rest assured we'll come find you... eventually. Edgeworth: ...You... You... Kay: What's wrong? Did you get cut off!? Edgeworth: No... My phone ran out of power. Kay: No way! Edgeworth: It doesn't matter anyway. We should try to get out of here through our own means. Kay: Yeah! I have a name to live up to, after all! If we put our heads together, we're sure to find a way out! Talk Kay Faraday The kidnapping (appears after examining cell phone, Bad Badger head, and photo rally sign) Edgeworth: Do you know where the person who kidnapped me went? Kay: Well, after they locked you up in here... ...it sounded like they went into the next room, and started talking to someone. Edgeworth: (I feel like I heard something as well, but it's all a haze in my mind. However, I do recall that the kidnapper was talking with someone... It was just a guess before, but I guess I really AM dealing with two kidnappers here.) Kay: After that, they left. It almost seemed as if they were done with you. Edgeworth: I suppose that is the case, as my kidnapping seems like an afterthought to the $1 million. Well, if they went into the next room, let's see what we can find out through the slot. Examine Door (after clearing \"The kidnapping\" Talk option) Kay: Ooh, we can peer into the room the kidnappers were in from there! Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Beam Edgeworth: There is a beam in the next room identical to the one in this room. There's even a hook on it to hold a propped-up floor panel in place. Which reminds me... Kay: Did you find something useful, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: Hmm, perhaps. I may have found a very handy hint to how we'll get out of here. Hatch Edgeworth: Is that what I think it is? Kay: It looks like the kidnappers had an escape tunnel prepared just in case. That's awesome! They're like a bunch of Great Thieves themselves! Edgeworth: No, they're not, because I highly doubt they made the tunnel themselves. The floor panel was removed and propped up (Open floor panel - The panel is held in place by a hook. The entrance to an underground room perhaps?) against the beam in a very specific way. I think this building was originally built with a basement or underground area. Gray door Edgeworth: There's a door on the opposite side that appears to be the same as this one. Which would mean... ...that I can probably assume that these two rooms are very similar in structure. (I believe I may have just found our ticket out.) Door (subsequent times, after examining hatch) Kay: Ooh, we can peer into the room the kidnappers were in from there! Edgeworth: (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.) Logic Connect \"Open floor panel\" and \"The beam I was tied to\" Leads to: \"This hook on this beam...\" Edgeworth: This hook on this beam... Kay: You know I already tried, and there's no way I can jump from this hook to the window! Come on, even you have to admit when something's just not possible. Edgeworth: Hah, I wasn't about to suggest that again. Rather, that it's here for a different purpose. Kay: Really!? Like what!? Edgeworth: As you saw in the adjacent room, it's clearly for keeping a floor panel propped up. Which means that there should be a panel in this room that we can open as well. Kay: Oh! I get it! Edgeworth: We didn't notice its existence all this time because it was being hidden by this tarp. Kay: Alright then! Let's fold this thing up and see what's underneath! Kay: Now THIS is what I call a treasure! Examine Closed hatch Kay: Wow, this must be another entrance to the secret, hidden basement! I totally smell treasure! Edgeworth: The scent I wish to smell is the sweet fragrance of freedom. Kay: Then what are you waiting for!? Hurry up and open the hatch! Edgeworth: Alright. .........Mmnph. This thing is locked down tight (Underground entrance - We might be able to escape through here, but the door is locked.). Kay: Aww! Fiddlesticks! Logic Connect \"Tiny key\" and \"Underground entrance\" Leads to: \"I believe you're up, Kay.\" Edgeworth: I believe you're up, Kay. Kay: Huh? Why me? Edgeworth: Because we need to use the tiny key that you've taken quite a liking to. Kay: Oh, gotcha! Just leave it to me! I love the tense feeling of these moments when you're about to uncover something big! Edgeworth: I believe the feeling of freedom would be much more satisfying right about now. Kay: Alright! I got the secret door open! And now...! Edgeworth: Ack! Wait! Kay: Wha--!? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgeworth: Are you alright!? Kay!? Kay: I'm fine. The ladder just slipped is all! Edgeworth: (Thank goodness she's alright. I about had a coronary...) Kay: There's a lot of really large machinery down here. Edgeworth: What about an exit? Kay: Umm... It's really dark and cramped down there, so I really doubt there's an exit. Argh, I can't believe that happened! Edgeworth: You have only yourself to blame for leaping before you looked, you know. Kay: No way! I mean, how was I supposed to know that the ladder is removable (Underground ladder - It looks as though it can be easily removed, but is it really safe to use...?)!? Examine Open hatch Edgeworth: (I finally got the door to the underground area open...) Kay, I just want to confirm with you that there wasn't an exit down there. Kay: Yeah, it was really cramped, and there was a lot of really large machinery. Edgeworth: I see. Are you hurt at all? Kay: I'm perfectly fine! I was just a little surprised when the ladder suddenly slipped out from under me... Edgeworth: (I wonder if this ladder can be put to some use...) Logic Connect \"Lockers\" and \"Underground ladder\" Leads to: \"I've figured out how we will escape this prison, Kay.\" Edgeworth: I've figured out how we will escape this prison, Kay. Kay: Oh? So, how are we going to bust out? Edgeworth: It seems that your reckless actions were of use after all. Kay: ...Are you actually praising me? Edgeworth: More of a \"thank you\" for giving me an idea regarding this ladder. Kay: The underground ladder? What about it? Edgeworth: This ladder isn't just for those who wish to go down... Kay: Oh! I see! If we use this...! Edgeworth: Yes, I believe it's long enough to reach the top of those lockers. Kay: Well, then what are we waiting for!? Investigation Complete Kay: Alright! Now we can get out of here! Edgeworth: Yes... We spent entirely too much time in here. (Kidnappers who held me hostage, and a mysterious Interpol agent... This case is only getting started, and I'll be the one to bring it to a resounding end!) March 13, 12:11 PM Wild, Wild West Area Edgeworth: It looks like it's stopped raining for now. Kay: Yeah, and thank goodness! You have no idea how hard it was raining earlier! ???: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm so glad to see you managed to escape, sir! I was so stressed that I thought my heart was gonna give out! Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, may I ask what in the world that is? Gumshoe: Well, that's... um... MIB: Count off! 1! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 98! 99! MIB: Shifu! All 99 members are here and accounted for, sir! ???: Heh... What the heck do you think you're doing counting my cubs off like that!? Every person is a valuable human being, you get me? And everyone has a name that their parents gave to them. No one is a 2 or a 3... Everyone, regardless of age or rank, is number 1! Got it!? Shifu! Shifu! Edgeworth: ...You are Agent Lang, I take it? MIB: You infidel! How dare you address our Shifu so rudely!? Lang: Grr! Lang Zi says: \"A cub who disrespects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder.\" So don't you ever forget to show the proper respect towards another person! Shih-na. This isn't much, but please accept my card. Edgeworth: Oh, thank you. ...Please, accept mine in return. Lang: You all see that just now!? That is the proper way for two people to show their respect! Keep that in mind and you'll get far in life, got it!? Edgeworth: (Ah, that's right... Franziska did warn me... Something about an elite Interpol Agent from the Republic of Zheng Fa. Apparently, this man has the highest successful arrest rate in the organization.) Agent Lang, why exactly is an Interpol agent involved with this clearly domestic case? Lang: That's none of your business, Mr. Prosecutor. Edgeworth: How is it not!? Lang: I've heard a rumor or two about you. You solved a murder that occurred during your flight home recently, right? Hah! But you sure took a while just to arrest one little flight attendant. How pathetic. Gumshoe: H-How dare you say that about Mr. Edgeworth!? Are you saying you could've solved it faster, pal!? Lang: The comedic relief jumps to the aid (changed from [aide] in the original release) of his master... How cliché. Look, what I'm getting at is that if I had been there, no one would've died. Edgeworth: ! Lang: I would've solved the entire case and Agent Hicks would still be with us here today. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang knew yesterday's victim, Agent Akbey Hicks...?) Lang: Hicks was like a brother to me, so now, I'm out to take my revenge! Edgeworth: (Agent Hicks was investigating a smuggling ring with Franziska and a third person... This must be the man she was talking about.) In that case, you should understand how I feel, as the kidnapped is someone I know. So I ask that you please allow me to participate in the investigation... Lang: Lang: This isn't your neatly trimmed Courtroom of Eden, you know. You're out in the wilderness now, Mr. Prosecutor, and way out of your league. No hard feelings, but why don't you go on back to your courtroom now, pretty boy? Edgeworth: You...! You dare to mock the court!? Lang: I do... And I don't need the help of a filthy \"prosecutor\". Sorry, but the truth doesn't need the likes of you to distort it today! Edgeworth: (Who uses the adjective \"filthy\" to describe a prosecutor...!? And why...? Why do I feel such intense loathing emanating from him!?) Lang: Alright, men! Good job on the perimeter around Gatewater Land. Now just find me the kidnapper, and bring the punk to me! Dismissed! Sir! Lang: Now then, Mr. Prosecutor, you just sit tight here and don't cause any trouble, understand? Edgeworth: W-Wait! Gumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Edgeworth: It's been a while since I last met someone so disagreeable. (Why of all places did he show up here? And completely out of the blue at that! I suppose I'll have to ask Detective Gumshoe to fill me in on that.) Talk Kay Faraday Kay: Maaaan... I can't calmly do any stealing at all with that detective around. Edgeworth: I suppose it's not easy when there's this many members of law enforcement in the vicinity. Kay: It's alright! It's not like I'm in a hurry to steal just any ol' thing! Edgeworth: (...Which is it? Do you plan to steal something or not? Quite the mystery, this one. Maybe I should talk with her a bit more.) Talk Next step Kay: So what are you going to do about your investigation into the kidnapping? Edgeworth: Good question. Since Agent Lang holds the authority to investigate this case now... ...this makes things a bit more complicated. Kay: Oh, come on, you can't let that stop you! I'll even lend you a hand, so let's go! Edgeworth: But you're a self-purported \"Great Thief\", are you not? I don't believe I can let someone of an unlawful nature participate in an investigation. Kay: You don't like to listen, do you? I'm not just any ol' (changed from [ordinary] in the original release) Great Thief; I'm the Yatagarasu! And as I said earlier... ...the Yatagarasu is after one and only one thing. \"One and only one\" (appears after \"Next step\") Edgeworth: What is this \"one and only one\" thing you're after? Kay: The Yatagarasu is only interested in one thing... ...and that is the truth. Edgeworth: I see...  Edgeworth: It was seven years ago... There was a vigilante who threw the business world into a panic. Labeled \"mysterious\" and \"phantom-like\", the Yatagarasu appeared and vanished at will. Though we still don't know much about this thief's ultimate goal, we do know the targets. The Yatagarasu liked to find and publicly disclose (changed from [make public,] in the original release) evidence of corrupt dealings of all sorts. Once a target was chosen, no dramatic calling card or announcement was sent forth. Instead, the chosen corporation was infiltrated without even the target noticing. Some days later, the evidence that was found was sent out to the mass media... ...along with a card with the mark of a three-legged raven. Looking back, I suppose you could call what the Yatagarasu was stealing the \"truth\". (Could this child really be the successor to the original Yatagarasu? But that can't be... can it...?) Present Prosecutor's Badge Kay: If I had one of these, I could be a prosecutor, too, right? Edgeworth: Don't even think of stealing this from me. Kay: If it's that important to you, then why don't you wear it on your lapel? Edgeworth: (Why should I have to label myself as a prosecutor everywhere I go? And why does everyone ask that question of me? That's what I'D like to know.) Gatewater Land Pamphlet Kay: I really love theme parks! Too bad we're not here to have a fun time... Edgeworth: So why did you choose this one, and why choose to show yourself to me of all people? Kay: Because I was tailing you, silly! Duh! Edgeworth: You were following me!? (But why?) Blue Badger Bible Kay: It's a book of information about my arch-enemy, the Blue Badger. But I won't lose to the likes of him! You just wait and see. I'm going to write a \"Tome of Thievery\"! How's that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (...The information that winds up on your wanted poster will suffice in this competition.) Badger Photo Rally Kay: Come on! The Badger family is waiting for us to find and take pictures of them! And remember, you have to yell, \"Badger GET!\" each time, or it doesn't count! Edgeworth: They even have a rule for when you take their pictures...? Kay: Tell me about it! I was planning to steal all of my shots, as any proper Great Thief should! Edgeworth: (Does the concept of stealing permeate every aspect of this girl's life...?) Anything else Kay: What do you think about this? Edgeworth: If you're going to steal anything, at least keep your hands off of my lines. Kay: Alright, alright. I'll return it to you. Here you go! Edgeworth: (I was hoping for some information in return, but my line will do for now.) Dick Gumshoe Edgeworth: Great job, Detective. Gumshoe: Sir! Edgeworth: For losing sight of me and the kidnapper, and allowing my investigation to be hijacked. Gumshoe: I... Sir...! Edgeworth: I look forward to your next month's salary assessment. Gumshoe: But... But the case isn't lost yet, sir! I'm gonna show you just how much of a man Dick Gumshoe can be! Edgeworth: Shall I prepare the 21-gun salute now or later? Talk Agent Lang Edgeworth: Detective, are you sure it was the precinct you called for backup? Gumshoe: O-Of course, sir! I think I would know the number to my own precinct like back of my hand! Edgeworth: Then why did an Interpol agent show up instead, with an army of his own agents? Gumshoe: That, I have no idea... About five minutes after I made the call, that wolf-man showed up out of nowhere, sir. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang definitely has an agenda, so the question is, \"What is he after?\") Next step (appears after \"Agent Lang\") Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! I was wondering if I may ask about one thing, sir! Edgeworth: Yes, what is it? Gumshoe: Um... Who is that? The girl over there, I mean. Kay: I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant, Kay Faraday! Gumshoe: Wh-Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: Funny, I don't recall making you my assistant, Kay... Gumshoe: Yeah! I'M Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! ME! It's been like that since... forever! Kay: Sorry, but I just stole your supporting role. Gumshoe: How can you say something so serious with that giant grin on your face, pal!? Mr. Edgeworth! We've got a thief on our hands, sir! She stole my role, sir! I'm taking her in, getting her convicted, and making sure she serves out her sentence! Kay: Oh, come on, it'll be fun! Like musical chairs! You'd better stay fast on your feet! Gumshoe: No way! I won't... I will not lose the spotlight to you, little girl! Present Prosecutor's Badge Gumshoe: If you're going to show me your Prosecutor's Badge, then I'll show you my police badge! Edgeworth: ...Your wallet is looking rather thin, Detective. Gumshoe: Huh? Oh, whoops. I must've left my badge at home. I always get the two mixed up. Ha ha. Edgeworth: That's not a laughing matter, Detective! Gatewater Land Pamphlet Gumshoe: Gatewater Land... Who would have guessed this place would be such a success? But the Gatewater Group and I go way back, you know? Edgeworth: Yes... Same here. I handled two murder cases that took place at two of their hotels. And it was you who headed the investigation in each case. Gumshoe: Oh, I remember that, sir! I was 16 back then, standing in front of the hotel in the snow... Edgeworth: (...Clearly, we are not on the same page here.) Blue Badger Bible Gumshoe: You actually got a copy, Mr. Edgeworth!? Ooh! Can you show me the very last page!? Edgeworth: The last page? Very well... Let's see here... ...Interesting. Why is your name listed here under \"Special Thanks\"? Gumshoe: That's it, sir! You found it! Oh... Um... That's because I did the choreography for the \"Dance, Dance, Blue Badger\" song! Edgeworth: (I suspect that no one entrusts him with any real responsibilities at work...) Badger Photo Rally Gumshoe: Oh, are you participating in the photo rally, too, Mr. Edgeworth!? Um... I mean, I'm only doing it as part of my duties! Yeah. Edgeworth: ...I see. In that case, keep up the good work. So, how many have you found so far? Gumshoe: I've been sorta busy with the investigation, so I haven't really found any yet, but... Edgeworth: (Something tells me finding the Badgers isn't really a part of his duties.) Anything else Gumshoe: I'm sorry, sir! Absolutely nothing is coming to mind right now! As a man, the only thing I can attest to is this: \"To be a man, I, Dick Gumshoe, will tell no lie!\" Edgeworth: (His heart's in the right place... Now to work on his deduction skills.) Officers Edgeworth: Excuse me, but if you could just let me through here... Officer: Sorry, I can't let anyone through. Agent Lang's orders. Edgeworth: Nnngh... (I suppose I'll have to deal with this impasse for now.) Blue Badger Blue Badger: .................. Edgeworth: (That wriggling... I just can't bring myself to call it \"dancing\"...) Examine Barrels on left side Edgeworth: I highly doubt I'll find a clue in here, but I might as well check, just to be sure. ...Mnngh. This barrel sure is heavy. You there! Do you know what's inside of this thing? Officer: It's the emergency water supply for putting out fires. Edgeworth: ...I see. Well, they certainly are well prepared. Horizontal bar Edgeworth: This horizontal bar is used... for tying up horses. Apparently, you can ride real horses at the Cowboy's Ranch area just up ahead. Is it possible that the culprits have already escaped with the help of a stolen horse or two? Officer: Under Agent Lang's orders, we already rounded up all the horses... ...and every last one has been accounted for. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang is good, although, I won't go so far as to say I'm impressed just yet...) Rocking chair Edgeworth: It's an old-fashioned rocking chair, the kind that makes you feel instantly at ease. There's something written here... \"A soothing 10-minute sitting for only $100\"...!? I see. Reverse psychology. Make it so expensive that no one would dare sit on it... Barrels by cactus Edgeworth: It's an empty barrel. I'd venture to guess that its only purpose is to set the mood. Cactus Edgeworth: It's a cactus... and there's something written here on this sign... \"This cactus is a very gracious gift to Gatewater Land from the local police precinct.\" (I can't believe the police went so far as to even donate a cactus to this place.) Garage door Edgeworth: Horses are painted on this garage door to complete the Wild West theme. They almost look like they're ready to jump out into the real world and gallop away. ...Almost, being the key word. Tracks Edgeworth: Some sort of tracks were left in the mud here thanks to the rain. They look like tire tracks. Too bad they're destroying the Wild West atmosphere they worked so hard to create. (The tires on whatever made these probably got pretty muddy, as well.) After clearing all Talk options with Dick Gumshoe and Kay Faraday: ???: Laaaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, son!? Edgeworth: Mr. Amano? Ernest: Oh! Miles, my boy! I'm sorry to involve you in such an affair just after you've returned. Edgeworth: For you, Mr. Amano, I gladly offer my assistance. After all, I have you to thank for how well things turned out during my time abroad. If it wasn't [sic] for you, I might not have been introduced to that law office... ...and had the chance to study the inner workings of another country's judicial system. Ernest: No, no, no. Think nothing of it. As you know, Manfred and I go way back. I consider a beloved disciple of his to be like one of my own blood. Edgeworth: ............ Ernest: If you ever want to go overseas again, you need only to ask. I can use my company's vast network to send you anywhere at any time. Kay: So who's the old man? Edgeworth: He is the father of the currently kidnapped Lance Amano, Ernest Amano. Ernest: Now then, have you found Lance yet, Miles? Please... I miss my poor boy dearly! Edgeworth: I'm terribly sorry, but your son's whereabouts remain unknown, Mr. Amano. Ernest: Wh-- Hold on there! Then, what happened to all that money!? Edgeworth: .........I believe the $1 million has been stolen, and that the culprits are now on the run. Ernest: Whaaaaat!? Kay: Poor old man... Don't you have anything you could give him to cheer him up, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: (Forgive me, Mr. Amano...) Talk Ernest Amano Talk The kidnapping Edgeworth: I was wondering if you could please tell me the details of the kidnapping one more time? Ernest: Oh. It was yesterday... A call came to the house. From the receiver came the sound of my son... \"Help me, Daddy!\"... *sniff* Edgeworth: I know this is tough, but please stay with me here, Mr. Amano... Ernest: You don't understand. He hasn't called me \"Daddy\" in ages... It was incredibly moving... I wish I had recorded him saying that. Edgeworth: (He definitely should have recorded that conversation... ...but not for the foolish sentimentalities of an old man.) Lance Amano Edgeworth: Refresh my memory, what kind of person is Lance again? Ernest: How will telling you about Lance help you get him back? Edgeworth: Surprisingly, a lot can be deduced from a person's relationships and behavior. Ernest: Very well, then. Lance is my one and only son, and he turned 21 this year. He is very much like me when I was his age -- kind and very attractive. I'm sure women simply can't keep their hands off of him. Edgeworth: Is there anything else about him you noticed of late? Ernest: Now that you mention it, I haven't been able to get in contact with our butler, Oliver. Edgeworth: Your butler...? Ernest: Yes, his name is Oliver Deacon. He's been with our family for years now. He gets along so well with Lance, so I thought maybe he would know where my son is... Oliver Deacon (appears after \"Lance Amano\") Edgeworth: Mr. Amano, could you please tell me a little more about your butler, Mr. Deacon? Ernest: As a butler, he's outstanding. He even serves as Lance's personal private tutor. He took a brief leave recently, but even after it was over, I haven't been able to reach him. Edgeworth: So you still haven't spoken with him since his leave? What about his family and friends? Ernest: They said they hadn't seen him. I've tried everything I could think of, Miles. ...Do you think this could have something to do with Lance's kidnapping? Edgeworth: It's possible, but I can't say anything for sure quite yet. (So even the person closest to the victim has gone missing... Oliver Deacon... Sounds like one name I had better keep in mind.) Present Prosecutor's Badge Ernest: Ah... Seeing that badge reminds me of Manfred. Now, HE was one fine prosecutor, the best of the best. Edgeworth: ...Yes, I can't disagree with you there. Ernest: Hmm... I sense that you don't really want to talk about him. Edgeworth: How I feel about him... It's hard for me to be truthful about that with another person. Ernest: Your hard countenance... I don't know what you're thinking or feeling... ...but mark my words, I think you are Manfred's true successor. I really do. Edgeworth: .................. Anything else Ernest: Ho, ho! That looks to be something with quite a bit of value. But then, all things have some value attached to them. Only by probing deep into the unknown can we become true winners in this world, Miles. Edgeworth: (Thanks, but knowledge isn't what's going to make me a winner here; it's information.) After clearing all Talk options with Ernest Amano: Edgeworth: .................. Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Let's begin our investigation. Even if that Interpol agent holds the authority to head this investigation... ...we can't allow ourselves to stand idly by, twiddling our thumbs. Gumshoe: I'm with you 100%, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! I, Dick Gumshoe, pledge to stick by your side through thick and thin! Edgeworth: Mr. Amano, it was my fault that the culprits escaped. Which is why, with your blessing, I vow to return Lance to you myself. Ernest: Oh! I've never seen you so passionate before, Miles. Good luck to you, my boy. Kay: Alright! Well, what are you waiting for!? Let's do some investigating! Gumshoe: If you think I'm losing to you, pal, forget it! Begin Investigation Wild, Wild West Area Gumshoe: So what should we examine first!? Edgeworth: Hmm... Thanks to Agent Lang, we can't leave this area. But the culprits were here until only very recently. Which means we may be able to find some clues that will tell us how they escaped. Gumshoe: OK! Let's get looking! Detective: Hey! You there! Gumshoe: Who, me!? Detective: What are you doing goofing off in a place like this!? Gumshoe: I wasn't goofing off! I was about to help Mr. Edgeworth kick off his investigation. Detective: You imbecile! All precinct detectives are now under Agent Lang's direct command! Gumshoe: N-No way! I am NOT working for Wolf-boy! Mr. Edgeworth! Can't you do something...!? Edgeworth: .................. I'm not exactly in a position to argue, seeing as how you ARE a member of the police. Detective: Good, now let's go! Gumshoe: Nooooooooooooooooooooooo!!! Detective: Boy, have I got just the job for someone of your talents! Kay: Well, that was exciting. Edgeworth: ............ Kay. Kay: What? Can't you tell I'm all ready to get down to some detective work!? Edgeworth: You should go home. Your parents must be worried about you. Kay: Oh, come on! I finally get to be your assistant and you try to ditch me!? Edgeworth: ...I don't recall offering you the position. Kay: Hmmmph. Why do you have to be so difficult? Besides, it's already too late, you know! Like I said, I've already stolen the position of \"assistant\" a while back! Edgeworth: Hah. You're the only one asserting that. Kay: Well! By the time anyone notices, it's already gone! That's the Yatagarasu way! Edgeworth: You shouldn't speak so lightly of things you know nothing about! Kay: Fine, whatever, you win. Go ahead and do your little investigation. But the talented assistant Kay, is going to tag along no matter what you say! Edgeworth: (Even if she turns out to be useless, she's not going to listen to me. I might as well surrender and let her come along for the ride...) Talk Blue Badger Blue Badger: .................. Kay: Hey! It's the Blue Badger! Badger GET! Edgeworth: (I really don't understand why she is so excited over this badger hunt. Speaking of Badgers, there's a person inside of there...) Mr. Badger, I wonder if you might share with me what you saw? Blue Badger: .................. Edgeworth: (He's doing that contorted wriggling \"dance\" again...) Kay: ............ Aha! ???: Aaaah! You've uncovered my undercover identity, sir! I was to remain under that head, sir! Edgeworth: ...Aren't you Officer Meekins? Meekins: SIR! Mike Meekins, reporting for duty, sir! Edgeworth: (This man was a witness in one of the cases I headed two years ago. About the only thing I remember about this officer is that... ...he often spoke and acted before he thought, which gave me a great deal of headaches.) Kay: Is he a friend of yours, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: I've met him in the courtroom once before. (Hmm... Why was he so upset when we unmasked him? Does he have something to hide?) Mike Meekins (after talking to Blue Badger) Talk Mike Meekins Edgeworth: Officer Meekins, why are you standing here wasting time? Meekins: SIR! Because I'm not a police officer right now, sir! I'm the Blue Badger! And I'm creating memories and dreams for the kids! That's never a waste of time, sir! I have a dream to become as big as Detective Gumshoe, sir! I was patrolling the scorchingly boring beat until a little while ago... ...when the dispatch radio on my shoulder crackled that the kidnappers had escaped, sir! I thought maybe this was my shot at making Detective, sir! I rushed on over to join in, but when I got here, there was a sea of people already... ...and I couldn't spread my trademark friendliness and joy on to anyone... Edgeworth: (It would seem that some people never change...) The Blue Badger Edgeworth: So why exactly are you in that ridiculous outfit? Meekins: Sir! That's because, sir! I'm here to keep the visitors in good spirits, sir! But it's also to hide the fact that I'm an officer on the trail of a kidnapper, sir! Edgeworth: I see. Agent Lang is very wise to employ this sort of diversionary tactics. Meekins: To be handed the role of THE Blue Badger out of all the different disguises, sir... It's... It's such an honor! Any clues? (appears after \"The Blue Badger\") Edgeworth: How long have you been standing here, Officer? Meekins: SIR! For about one little hour, sir! Edgeworth: (Hmm... That's around the time I woke up from being knocked unconscious...) Meekins: And I've been here even since, sir! Edgeworth: (If that's true, then it's possible Officer Meekins saw the kidnappers escaping!) Meekins: B-B-B-However, sir! I must tell you I didn't see a thiiiiiiing, sir!!! Edgeworth: I haven't asked you anything yet, Officer. Meekins: No no no no no! B-But I know you will, sir! Edgeworth: (He's hiding something from me.) Officer Meekins, I insist that you tell me more about your recent movements! Meekins: Sir! I've been playing the Blue Badger this whole time, sir! And getting into it, too! I patrolled the park, all while wearing this costume! And about one hour ago, I came over here, sir! I haven't seen any suspicious-looking people this whole time, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: What you said just now is contradictory to the facts. Kay: How so, Mr. Edgeworth!? Edgeworth: This is what Officer Meekins's testimony contradicts! Present Badger Photo Rally Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Officer Meekins, let's back things up. I'd like to ask you about your last statement.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your testimony contradicts this piece of evidence! Meekins: I'm just a little patrolman, so I don't understand what you're talking about, sir! Kay: I can't say I get it, either. Edgeworth: (Gnnnrk! This isn't what I was looking for!) I'm sorry, Officer, but could you please repeat what you said one more time? Meekins: Of course, sir! I'd be honored to repeat myself as many times as needed, sir! For almost a whole little hour, I didn't see any suspicious-looking people around, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: As I thought, what you said just now is contradictory to the facts. Kay: OK, so what exactly is so contradictory, Mr. Edgeworth? Leads back to: \"This is what Officer Meekins's testimony contradicts!\" Edgeworth: Officer Meekins, let's back things up. I'd like to ask you about your last statement. Meekins: Sir! Of course, sir! If that's your wish, Mr. Prosecutor! This little patrolman will wait as long as I am commanded to wait! Edgeworth: You said that you saw a Blue Badger, correct? And yet, if you take a look at this, what you saw was not supposed to happen. This park is supposed to have only one of each Badger in it at any given time. Which means that as long as you are the Blue Badger, Officer Meekins... ...you should not have seen another Blue Badger wandering the premises! Meekins: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!? SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!? Kay: Then, that would mean that there are two Blue Badgers (A 2nd Blue Badger - There's only supposed to be 1 Blue Badger in the park, but a second was spotted.) walking around! But why!? Any clues? (subsequent times) Edgeworth: How long have you been standing here, Officer? Meekins: SIR! For about one little hour, sir! Edgeworth: (Hmm... That's around the time I woke up from being knocked unconscious...) Meekins: And I've been here even since, sir! Edgeworth: (If that's true, then it's possible Officer Meekins saw the kidnappers escaping!) Meekins: Yup, I've been hanging around in this area ever since then, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger! Edgeworth: And yet, if you take a look at this, what you saw was not supposed to happen. This park is supposed to have only one of each Badger in it at any given time. Which means that as long as you are the Blue Badger, Officer Meekins... ...you should not have seen another Blue Badger wandering the premises! Meekins: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!? SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!? Kay: But then, that would mean that there are two Blue Badgers walking around the park! Present Prosecutor's Badge Meekins: Sir! It's so incredibly shiny, but it has a really ugly shape! I knew it! I was right to go for the much more manly police badge, sir! But I lose it alot [sic], and I just know I'm going to lose it for real one of these days, sir! Kay: ...Mr. Edgeworth, I think this cop is one donut short of a baker's dozen. Edgeworth: I know. Believe me, I know. Blue Badger Bible Meekins: Sir! You have a copy of the Blue Badger Bible, too, sir!? That was written by experts on the Badger family, sir! And it's very, very thorough! It doesn't matter that I was made the Blue Badger only a little while ago, sir! That book helped me memorize every name of every Badger, sir! Edgeworth: (It's not that hard to remember four incredibly obvious names...) Badger Photo Rally Meekins: Drip, drop, little by little our privacy is being sold off to the public through this, sir! But that means I need to work extra hard on my cute poses! Kay: Ooh, like what? Meekins: Like thiiiiiiiiiiis! Kay: Great! Now I know what your new pose will beeeeeeeeeee! Look, sir! I've successfully stolen his pose and speaking styyyyyyyyyyyyyle, sir! Edgeworth: *sigh* That's nice, Kay. Anything else Meekins: Sir! I'm undercover as the Blue Badger now, sir! I must pretend to not know anything about anything, sir! Edgeworth: (I mustn't respond to that. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel...) Ernest Amano Present Stolen Costumes Ernest: Just what sort of operation is this, that they would allow their valuables to be stolen!? It's a disgrace to the way businesses are run everywhere! Edgeworth: Well, thieves, by nature. generally tend to target these types. Ernest: Stealing is an abominable behavior, don't you agree, little miss!? Kay: ...Y-Yeah, the worst! Edgeworth: (Am I going to have to add \"hypocrite\" to the list of things you are, missy?) Examine Barrels on left side Kay: Hah! I've got you now, you vile criminals! Edgeworth: ...I'd think the kidnappers would have better sense than to try hiding in these. Kay: Oh, come on! Lighten up, will ya? I was only joking! I don't REALLY think that the criminals would be hiding here, right in front of two officers! Edgeworth: ...I-I certainly hope not. Footprints Kay: Hey! There's a bunch of footprints in the mud over here! Edgeworth: I remember hearing rain fall out here while I was being held in there. Kay: Yup, it was just a passing rain. That's why the ground has already pretty much dried up. Edgeworth: I should be thankful. It left us with some nice footprint samples. Kay: You know what? I bet if we followed them, we can find out where the kidnappers went! Plus, we'd be able to spot them because of their muddy shoes! Edgeworth: ...I don't think it will be that easy. Kay: Why not? Edgeworth: Look carefully. There are quite a few different sets here. And we don't know which ones belong to the kidnappers. Kay: Oh, that's true... We don't know what kind of shoes (What kind of shoes? - If only we knew, we'd be able to track the kidnappers from the footprints.) they were wearing. Horizontal bar Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth, isn't this one of those things you tie horses to? Edgeworth: Yes, although the horses are in another location at the moment. Kay: Aww... And here I was hoping I would get to ride one. Edgeworth: You know how to ride a horse? Kay: Nope! Never rode one in my life! But I have an Asian friend who was born in the year of the horse! Edgeworth: (\"Non sequitur\" is the only way to describe your logic...) Barrels by cactus Kay: If these were real, I wonder what you'd put in them. Edgeworth: Water would be the obvious answer... Kay: But if you stored water in a barrel under the blazing hot sun, wouldn't it go bad? Edgeworth: People of that period probably didn't care about how it tasted. Kay: Sorry, but I can't let you get away with making fun of our forefathers! I mean, maybe they really liked the strange taste! Edgeworth: ...Look who's making fun of them now. Cactus Kay: Look! There's a blurb about the cactus here! \"This cactus is a very gracious gift to Gatewater Land from the local police precinct.\" Edgeworth: (I can't believe the police went so far as to even donate a cactus to this place.) Kay: So, is the police department running a cactus farm on the side? Ha ha, just kidding! They wouldn't do something so silly! Edgeworth: (Actually, I have the vague impression I've seen a cactus farm at the precinct before.) Garage door Edgeworth: Horses are painted on this garage door to complete the Wild West theme. Kay: They look so life-like, don't you think!? Edgeworth: Are you thinking of wrangling, or rather, stealing them? Kay: If you can coax them out of there, sure! Come on, I know you can sweet-talk them out! Edgeworth: I could be holding a cube of sugar in my hand and they wouldn't budge, Kay. Tracks Edgeworth: It's a set of tire tracks originating from the garage. Kay: Aha! So that means a car left from the garage at some time, right? Edgeworth: Correct. But for the car to leave these tracks... ...it would mean that it left during the passing rain. (That's the only explanation as to why these tracks are made of mud.) Hmm, three treads... I think we can also safely assume it's a special type of car. Logic Connect \"Costumes\" and \"A 2nd Blue Badger\" Edgeworth: A second Blue Badger that shouldn't exist... Clearly, the true identity of the person underneath is... Kay: Oh, I know! It's one of the kidnappers, right!? The person wore a costume to get away (Costumed escape - The identity of the second Blue Badger was probably the kidnapper in disguise.)! Edgeworth: Precisely. After all, the costumes that went missing from the storage area are... Kay: ...A Blue Badger, a Proto Badger, and a Bad Badger. Edgeworth: Yes, those three. Kay: So there are three phony Badgers running around in the park somewhere, huh! Stolen Costumes data jotted down in my Organizer. Connect \"What kind of shoes?\" and \"Costumed escape\" Leads to: \"Now that we know that the kidnappers were wearing Badger costumes...\" Partner Kay: Yes? Talk The kidnapping Edgeworth: Kay, what do you think about the kidnapping? Kay: Well, I don't know anything about the victim... ...so actually, I was hoping you could tell me. Edgeworth: Ah, that's right. I never did explain the situation to you. I got involved because of a phone call I received. It was from none other than the director of the Amano Group, Mr. Ernest Amano. His only son, Lance, had been kidnapped, and he wanted me to be the drop-off man. Little did I suspect that I would be abducted myself. Kay: And that's when I found you tied to a pole screaming, \"Nnnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!!\" Edgeworth: Can you please drop that already!? Present Prosecutor's Badge Kay: If I had one of these, I could be a prosecutor, too, right? Edgeworth: Don't even think of stealing this from me. Kay: If it's that important to you, then why don't you wear it on your lapel? Edgeworth: (I suppose I can't really tell her... ...that no one in the Prosecutor's Office wears their badges. But why does everyone ask that question of me? That's what I'D like to know.) Stolen Costumes Kay: Looks like there's another thief afoot! Edgeworth: Only if we assume that this is not your handiwork. Kay: Are you kidding!? You know that the Blue Badger is enemy number one to me! Can you imagine me ever being on good terms with that thing!? Edgeworth: .................. Actually, it's surprisingly easy. Edgeworth: Now that we know that the kidnappers were wearing Badger costumes... ...those footprints from earlier take on a new, and very significant meaning. Kay: Oh, you mean now we know which tracks belong to the kidnappers, right!? Edgeworth: Yes. More than shoe prints, we need to follow the paw prints of Badgers. Kay: OK, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to use those footprints and go Badger hunting! Examine Footprints Leads to: \"Hmm... So we're looking for footprints made by a costume...\" Kay: Hmm... So we're looking for footprints made by a costume... Hey! I think I found them! There are two sets here! Edgeworth: They both do look like possible candidates. Kay: This set is walking off to the west... Argh! It just stops! I can't make heads or tails of where it's headed from here! Edgeworth: I think we can assume it's headed towards the stadium... Kay: Hmm... I wonder where the other set leads? This one seems to be headed east... Huh? Quick, Mr. Edgeworth! I've got him! I got one of the culprits! Meekins: Aaaah! Nooooo! I'm not a kidnapper, sir!!! Edgeworth: Down, Kay. Clearly, those footprints belong to Officer Meekins. But our criminals were each wearing a costume. Kay: Aha! Maybe they came over to this garage for something? Edgeworth: That's what I would suppose. Officer Meekins, if you could step aside for a moment. We need to examine the garage. Meekins: SIR! Roger Wilco, sir! Examine Garage door Leads to: \"Let's open this shutter and see what we find.\" Footprints Edgeworth: There are two sets of prints that could be from the kidnappers... Kay: One set is headed off to the west... Edgeworth: To the stadium, I would suppose... Kay: And the other set heads to the east... Edgeworth: We should follow these prints to their conclusion and investigate the garage. Kay: OK! Edgeworth: Let's open this shutter and see what we find. Kay: Maybe we'll find the kidnappers hiding inside! Kay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Edgeworth: Wh-What in the--!? (We seem to have stumbled across a dead body...) Kay: ............ Edgeworth: (She must be in severe shock to have been the first to find it... Now then, who is this man?) Ernest: I-It's Oliver! Edgeworth: ! Mr. Amano, are you saying that this man is... Ernest: Yes... He's my butler... How could something like this have happened!? Edgeworth: (Indeed. And why was Mr. Deacon here to begin with? I'd better investigate this crime scene quickly, before Agent Lang or his men return. The kidnapper's footprints lead right to this garage... ...and right to a dead body. Is it possible one of the kidnappers is now a murder victim (Victim was kidnapper? - Following a kidnapper's prints led us to a body. Was the victim in a costume?)...?) From my cursory examination, I believe this man died of a fatal bullet wound. Preliminary Findings data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: You sure are calm for someone who just found a body. Edgeworth: (It's surprising what one can become accustomed to in the span of two days...) Leads to examination of body Talk Ernest Amano Edgeworth: Mr. Amano... This body... Ernest: Yes... That's my butler, Oliver... How could something like this have happened!? Edgeworth: (Indeed. And why was Mr. Deacon here to begin with?) Examine Footprints Edgeworth: There are two sets of prints that could be from the kidnappers... Kay: One set is headed off to the west... Edgeworth: To the stadium, I would suppose... Kay: And the other set heads to the east... Edgeworth: ...Right to the garage. (Do these prints belong to the victim we found inside the garage?) Rocking chair Kay: Ooh, did you know? I really love this kind of chair, the way it rocks back and forth! When I grow old, I plan to sit in one of these and rock the day away every day! But you don't have to wait, Mr. Edgeworth! You're at just the right age for one! Edgeworth: (Do I really project myself as someone of that age?) Blue Badgermobile Edgeworth: What a peculiar car... Kay: Yeah. From the look of it, it must be the Blue Badgermobile. And it has three tires... So maybe it left those tire tracks behind!? Edgeworth: *sigh* That's simply not possible. Kay: Huh? Why? Edgeworth: Take a look at the tires. There's no mud stuck to them. Therefore, it must have been here since before it started to rain. Kay: Oh, gotcha! Good eye! Edgeworth: (It's a shame I don't see any other clues around...) Body Edgeworth: (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.) Examine Pendant Edgeworth: (This is an unusually-shaped pendant...) Kay: What is it? Is it something valuable? Edgeworth: (She seems to have regained some of her composure...) Kay: It looks like a horse pendant! It's got an antique feel about it, and it's really pretty... Hold on... This is made of platinum silver! Nice! It IS worth something after all! Ooh, and look! There's something written on the back. \"Colin Devorae\"... It's a name. Edgeworth: \"Colin Devorae\"...? (But this man's name is...) Wounds Edgeworth: (As long as that Interpol agent has control of this case... ...I'm not going to be able to have a real autopsy done on the victim. I'm no doctor, but let's see what I can piece together myself.) Hmm, there are two gunshot wounds one in his abdomen and one in his shoulder. Kay: So that means he was shot twice...? Edgeworth: No, I don't think so. I think the abdominal one is an entry wound, and the one near his shoulder is the exit wound. Kay: Nice! I knew you could figure it out! Edgeworth: It comes with experience, and I've seen my share of crime scenes. (Speaking of experience... ...this crime scene seems a bit too clean for a murder where the bullet went clean through. I should make a note of this oddity.) Preliminary Findings data updated in my Organizer. Wounds (subsequent times) Edgeworth: Hmm, there are two gunshot wounds one in his abdomen and one in his shoulder. Kay: So that means he was shot twice...? Edgeworth: No, I don't think so. I think the abdominal one is an entry wound, and the one near his shoulder is the exit wound. Kay: Nice! I knew you could figure it out! Edgeworth: It comes with experience, and I've seen my share of crime scenes. (Speaking of experience... ...this crime scene seems a bit too clean for a murder where the bullet went clean through. I should make a note of this oddity.) Deduce pendant (after examining pendant) Edgeworth: (Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?) Present Preliminary Findings Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There's something not right about the name on the pendant. The victim is the Amano family butler, and his name is \"Oliver Deacon\". But the name on the pendant is \"Colin Devorae\". Kay: I wonder what's up with that? Edgeworth: I don't know, but... ...I think we've hit upon an important piece of information. Mr. Deacon's Pendant data jotted down in my Organizer. Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence alone solves this whole case! Kay: Really!? You think so!? Because to be honest, I don't really see how it solves anything... You must be confused jumping from a kidnapping to a murder. Yeah, that's it! Edgeworth: (Nngh! I can't believe I made such a large blunder... ...that even this little girl could point it out!) Leads back to examination of body Examine evidence Mr. Deacon's Pendant Front side Edgeworth: It's the victim's pendant, which is shaped like a horse. Kay: It's got a real dignified look on its face. That makes it worth all the more... ! Oh no, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: What? Did you find an important piece of evidence? Kay: This... is made of platinum silver! That makes this thing super-valuable! I've seen this type of jewelry at a lot of stores before, so I know it when I see it! Edgeworth: ............Kay, if you ever laid so much as a finger on those pieces of jewelry... Kay: Wh-What? Me? I-I'd never do something like that! Edgeworth: (......Is it possible that she has never wanted to steal from a jewelry store before?) Name on back Edgeworth: The name \"Colin Devorae\" is engraved here. Kay: I really admire people who carve their own names into a pendant. Edgeworth: Oh? And why would that be? Kay: You have no imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. Did you ever think that maybe people want to have their loved ones always nearby? Edgeworth: It's not as if I have a wedding band, and I have no interest in accessorizing. Kay: *sigh* I suppose. Anyway, you know what? More than wearing flashy accessories... ...I'd rather be engraving my name into every treasure I can find all around the world! Edgeworth: (A sign of affection is one thing, but blatant vandalizing is just a bit different.) Partner Talk The murder Edgeworth: It appears that this case has taken a turn for the unexpected. Kay: I'll say! I was shocked to open that shutter and find a dead body inside! Edgeworth: I suppose most people would be, since the average person rarely runs across a corpse. Kay: Wait! You just compared me to a \"normal person\", didn't you!? I'll have you know that I'm... Edgeworth: Sorry. I suppose I should have recognized that you're a... thief, correct? Kay: No! I'm a GREAT Thief! And a GREAT Thief is not surprised by anything! Got it!? Edgeworth: (Apparently, with GREAT thievery comes GREAT loss of short-term memory.) Present Mr. Deacon's Pendant Kay: This horse is really pretty... Edgeworth: Don't even think about it. Kay: OK, I'll just hold onto it then! Don't worry, it's safe with me! Edgeworth: (Just so we're clear, Kay, a five-finger discount is not part of the bargain.) After examining wounds and correctly deducing pendant: Investigation Complete ???: Laaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, sweetie!? Edgeworth: Excuse me, but you are...? ???: *ba-dump* Edgeworth: ? ???: Oh, this is bad... He's really good looking! Ack! Stop it, Lauren! You can't let yourself fall for a playboy like him! You're in love with... Kay: Sounds like someone doesn't know the meaning of the phrase \"inner monologue\", huh? Edgeworth: Sorry to interrupt your... conversation, but might you be a friend of Lance? ???: Yes, I'm Lance's girlfriend... My name is Lauren Paups. Edgeworth: His girlfriend...? Paups: Oh, it's not like that! We're more like friends... and, um... We're not lovers or anything! We! Well, we haven't gotten that far yet! But... I guess that's how people are going to see it, so I should just accept it... I even got this ring as a present from Lance... *swoon* Kay: Ha ha, you know what she reminds of? A cartoon character! Edgeworth: N...Nnnnrrrghn... May I inquire as to why you are here? Paups: I haven't been able to get in contact with Lance lately... ...and I began to get really worried. *sob* I looked everywhere for him, and then I heard about the kidnapping, so I came here. Kay: Wow, you're really strong for having made it through all this by yourself! Paups: Um! Is it true!? Has Lance really been kidnapped!? Edgeworth: ...No one is supposed to know, but yes, it's true. Paups: Oh, Lance...! I can't believe you've been spirited away... I wonder how you're doing right now... Kay: Looks like she's gone back to the \"fair maiden in love\" routine... So, Mr. Edgeworth, where do we go from here? Edgeworth: Well, we found a body, so we should look into the murder... ???: Lang: My men brought me up to speed over the radio. And I have to say, you really should've called. I heard you found something very intriguing. Edgeworth: I have nothing to hide, Agent Lang. It's exactly what you see before you. Lang: I'll take it from here. Yeah, that guy's really dead. Hey! You waiting for an invitation? Hurry up and detain the suspect, now. Edgeworth: (Suspect? Who...?) Lang: Officer Meekins, is it? You're coming with us. Meekins: What!? SIR! I had nothing to do with it, sir! Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Don't you think you're being a bit rash!? Do you even have a good reason to suspect Officer Meekins!? Lang: Hah, I leave that kind of stuff to you prosecutors. It's your job, after all. Like I said earlier, the crime scene isn't as forgiving as your precious courtroom. Edgeworth: That's your answer!? Lang: I know you like your logic and reasoning... ...but that sort of impractical fluff is not needed out here in the field. Edgeworth: ! Lang: All you have to do is arrest suspicious person after suspicious person. That's how you eliminate crime from the streets! Edgeworth: But that's also precisely how you unnecessarily arrest innocent people by mistake! Lang: \"Innocent people\"? Nonsense! There's no such thing as an innocent person. We've all got a blemish or two in our hearts. Edgeworth: That's tyranny! I won't allow such a thing to go on unchecked before my eyes! Lang: Heh! Too bad you don't call the shots around here! Edgeworth: As I have sworn to uphold the laws of this land, I cannot allow you to take this man in. That you would arrest a man on false charges without even conducting an investigation... ...have you no honor as a member of law enforcement!? MIB: You! How dare you speak so disrespectfully to our Shifu!? Lang: Hold it! .................. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You amuse me, Mr. Prosecutor. Lang Zi says: \"Every pack has its own rules.\" If you can play by their rules and come out on top, that is a true victory. Alright, I'll give your beloved laws a fair shake. I'll show you just how much investigating I've done... ...through my line of logic! Argument -- Shi-Long Lang's Logic -- Lang: I've seen a lot of bodies like the one being carted off in my time. I can say he was shot in a single glance, but even you figured that much out, right? With your current gun laws, it's not exactly easy to get your hands on a gun. Not unless you're a member of law enforcement like Officer Meekins, isn't that right? Edgeworth: That is your reasoning...? Lang: Solid as a rock! It's based on the philosophy of detainment! Kay: Um... What's this \"philosophy of detainment\"? Lang: Hah! You don't know!? In that case, pay attention, girlie. In my country, the criminals have a saying: \"Beware of the wolf.\" Edgeworth: Why the wolf...? Lang: Because in my language, \"lang\" means \"wolf\", and you don't mess with me or my pack. And as for the detainment philosophy, its father is my honorable ancestor, Lang Zi. Edgeworth: (Hmm... You'd think I'd have heard of him and his teachings if he is [sic] that famous...) Lang: Lang Zi developed it as he worked to lock criminals away thousands of years ago. To this day, the Zheng Fa police still trains its recruits using his philosophies. Kay: But \"thousands of years ago\"? That makes your story about as believable as a fairy tale! Edgeworth: Hmph. Anything wears down and breaks over time. Do you really believe something as ancient as that can be applied to today's world? Lang: ......You want to put it to a test? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So what can you tell me about the body? Lang: A lot. Even without an autopsy, I have my eyes. They teach you the basics of forensics along with the detention philosophy. Edgeworth: Oh? Then you wouldn't mind telling me a little of what you've figured out, correct? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Yes, I think anyone who saw the bullet wounds would come to the same conclusion. Lang: Lang: Heh, don't pat yourself on the back yet! Edgeworth: What's that supposed to mean? Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Search where the water is deepest.\" You have to keep your eyes on the big fish that lurks in the depths, which is the killer. Edgeworth: Is that right? And what would you know about the killer? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It would appear you've studied a little of our laws. Lang: Studied? Who needs to study what every child on any street corner already knows? It's that... that......... Shih-na! Shih-na: The \"Federal Firearms Restriction Act\". Lang: That's it. The Federal Firearms Restriction Act. I hear it's not easy to get a gun these days. Edgeworth: (Interesting. That woman is the one in charge of keeping track of the information.) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If that's the case, there are plenty of other officers who might be potential suspects. You're not seriously going to arrest each and every one of them, are you? Lang: As if I would need to! I've already looked into everyone else here. Edgeworth: Oh? Lang: Other than Officer Meekins. I know no one else's weapon has been fired. Edgeworth: ! H-How did you check every single person's weapon in such a short span of time!? Lang: That's because each and every one of my subordinates is extremely capable. It didn't take more than a few minutes to conduct the entire investigation! Edgeworth: (The power of sheer numbers...) But you have yet to check Officer Meekins's weapon, correct? Lang: Thanks for reminding me. Hey, you! Show me your gun. Meekins: ..................Oh! Edgeworth: (What's wrong...? Why does he look so sickly pale all of a sudden?) Meekins: ............Gun! Lang: What did you say? I can't hear you. Stop mumbling and spit it out already! Meekins: Sir, sir... I LOST MY GUN, SIIIIIIIIIIR!!! Edgeworth: How could you be so irresponsible!? Lang: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! In the end, it looks like you're still the only suspect we've got. You're the one who waited here outside this garage to ambush and kill the victim! Edgeworth: (So you think that Officer Meekins waited here to kill the victim, do you, Lang? I think this little accusation deserves a lot more scrutiny.) Add statement \"Officer Meekins ambushed the victim in this garage and killed him here with his gun!\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you are implying that the murder weapon in this case is a policeman's service revolver? Lang: I don't know for sure just yet, but it's entirely possible. After all, Officer Meekins did just admit that he \"lost his gun\". Ha ha ha ha! You'd think he could come up with a better lie than that! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean to tell me that the murder occurred here, in this garage? Lang: From the fact that the suspect was found almost next to where the body was found... ...I'd say that it's pretty obvious that this is the crime scene. Lang Zi says: \"A criminal always returns to the scene of the crime.\" Kay: Hey! Finally, a quote even I've heard of before! Lang: Furthermore, Lang Zi says: \"Successful investigations are the result of multiple returns to a crime scene.\" Edgeworth: (Looks like neither detectives nor criminals have changed their ways over the millenniums.) Edgeworth: (So this is the kind of conclusion the philosophy of detainment can lead you to...) Kay: I don't get it, Mr. Edgeworth. Why are you putting yourself on the line for Mr. Meekins? Edgeworth: It's not that I particularly care about what happens to Officer Meekins. Kay: Whaaaaat!? Edgeworth: However, I can't simply stand by while Agent Lang ignores our country's laws. (Shi-Long Lang... Just what sort of investigator are you?)Lang: I've seen a lot of bodies like the one being carted off in my time. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So what can you tell me about the body?

Edgeworth: However, I can't simply stand by while Agent Lang ignores our country's laws. (Shi-Long Lang... Just what sort of investigator are you?) Edgeworth: Unfortunately for you, Agent Lang, that is simply not possible. Lang: What do you mean? Edgeworth: You've seen the crime scene for yourself. And while you were looking, did you not think to yourself that it was a little too clean? Lang: Aiya! Edgeworth: So you did notice that there was too little blood. Do you still wish to claim that Officer Meekins committed the murder here? Because this isn't the crime scene. And if it was your men who led you to think it was... ...then I suggest you leave this case to the local police to set the record straight! Lang: Grr! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Not bad. I see your logic can be just as sound as mine. In that case, let me ask you this: Don't you think it's weird that officer was hanging out around here in the first place? Edgeworth: Weird? How so? Lang: Hey, you! Your squad's not even supposed to be in this area, right? What were you doing neglecting your duties and loafing around here? Meekins: I-I...! Lang: Don't you dare give me some lame excuse like, \"I found myself taking a walk.\" Meekins: But sir... I really did take a walk, sir! Lang: You're a disgrace. How dare you take your pack obligations so lightly? Edgeworth: (Officer Meekins is looking extra meek. Is he hiding something...?) Meekins: Mr. Edgeworth! Please! Sir! Save me the way you did earlier, please, sir! Edgeworth: ...Officer Meekins. Please give is a detailed account of what happened. Meekins: SIR! Not you, too! Testimony -- Meekins's Testimony -- Meekins: It's true, sir! I wasn't assigned to this area, sir! I was told to check every square inch of the main gate area, sir! I also went looking for the kidnappers while selling dreams in the Blue Badgermobile, sir! But! I got completely caught up in my role, selling dreams to the children! SIR! Before I knew it, I found myself here in this area, sir! Edgeworth: What is this \"Blue Badgermobile\"? Meekins: It's a moving store on wheels that sells sweet dreams and merchandise, sir! Kay: So the Blue Badgermobile is just a roaming souvenir shop? Blue Badgermobile data jotted down in my Organizer. Meekins: SIR! I swear I was chasing the kidnappers down while I was being a good dream merchant! Edgeworth: (He seems rather worked up... Even more than his usual hyperactive self.) Kay: He sure seems sure of what he's saying. Edgeworth: Can you try to calm down and lower your voice to a more reasonable level, Officer? Meekins: SIR! Roger, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Alright then, where were you assigned to? Meekins: I-I was assigned to the main gate, sir! Edgeworth: (He must mean the area with the bridge and the outrageous fountain.) Kay: OK, then why are you here in the Wild, Wild West area? Meekins: That's because! It's because of a very deep reason, ma'am! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Describe for me how you conducted your investigation. Meekins: Yes, sir! Well! First, I made sure there were no suspicious-looking people in the area, sir! But! The only people that seemed to gather around me... ...were little girls, sir! Kay: Well, what did you expect when you're dressed like the Blue Badger? Meekins: I thought I had no choice at that point, sir, so... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What exactly do you mean by \"selling dreams\"? Meekins: SIR! The Blue Badgermobile is where dreams are collected! Kay: Um, what? Meekins: Sweetness like you've never known except in dreams, ma'am, like \"Innocence Drops\". And bitterness found only in nightmares, ma'am, like \"Guilty Jawbreakers\". Selling those as I pushed the Blue Badgermobile along is my sworn duty, ma'am! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You completely forgot to look for the kidnappers? Meekins: NO, SIR! OF COURSE NOT, SIR! I! I would never do something like that, sir! Edgeworth: .................. Meekins: ..................Umm... You're absolutely riiiiiiiight! Kay: Wow, you're good at this forcing-people-to-confess thing, Mr. Edgeworth! Meekins: To be frank, I'm just a little man, sir... I'm better at selling kids a few small dreams than looking for a big crook, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Enough wallowing in your own self-pity. Let's return to your testimony. Meekins: Yes, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: How did you wind up all the way over here? Meekins: I was in the middle of a sea of kids, sir... But one of the kids decided to challenge me to a fight, sir! I had to run away from the child's painful dropkicks, and before I knew it... Kay: Ha ha, the good ol' dropkick! I dished out my fair share of those when I was a kid! It was always the best when you felt one really connect with your opponent! Edgeworth: In any case, you wound up here for a reason completely unrelated to the investigation? Meekins: SIR! That's right, sir! Edgeworth: ...That's not something you should be admitting to with your head held high, Officer. Edgeworth: (It sounds like he simply forgot about his real job and became the Blue Badger... However, there is one flaw in Officer Meekins's story. But I have the feeling that he'll need some prodding before he'll spill the beans.)Oldbag: I came to this stadium to take a short break. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean you took a break from being the Pink Badger? Oldbag: You may not think it, but it's hard work keeping kids' dreams alive. You smell of sweat, your hip creaks with pain -- you even begin to dream about work. Kay: That's the kind of story that would scar a child for life, you know... Oldbag: Well, that's why I chose to come take my break here, whippersnapper! I don't plan on playing the part of the Dead Badger in front of a bunch of kids! Edgeworth: So what did you see while you, the Pink Badger, were resting? Oldbag: Oh, yes, that! Well! Oldbag: As I was resting, I happened to glance over and I saw two men facing each other in that area. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You saw two men...? Can you describe them for me? Oldbag: They looked like your average Joes, completely uninteresting and not worth fawning over. I'm telling you, they were so boring that I don't even remember much beyond that. Edgeworth: But did they have any special features? Anything you can recall would be very helpful. Oldbag: Oh, my! Don't tell me you're jealous of those two men! Kay: Hey, she's right. You do seem pretty worked-up over them, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: I-I'm not worked up over anyone! A-And I'm not jealous! Oldbag: It's alright, Edgey-poo. Those two were just foals compared to a stallion like you. I thought so little of them that I lost interest the instant I laid eyes on them. Oldbag: Suddenly, there was a loud gunshot, and the person who was shot fell to the ground. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You're claiming to have seen the exact moment in which the murder took place? Oldbag: Absolutely! That gun made a terrible racket when it was fired. Kay: You didn't try to go help the person that got shot? Oldbag: I'm only one person, you smart-alecky brat! What could I have done!? But I took off as soon as I could to find someone who could help. Oldbag: It was a very terrifying experience, let me tell you! Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: .................. Oldbag: .................. Well, don't you have anything to say to me!? Edgeworth: No, not especially. Oldbag: You're so cold, Edgey-poo. But... that is exactly what I like about you. Kay: You sure are one tough cookie! One part unshakable, and one part scary... Oldbag: Watch that smart mouth of yours, missy! What do you know about my fragile heart!? Edgeworth: (I can tell this is an important piece of testimony, but she's rather vague in a few spots. *sigh* I suppose this means I'm going to have to talk with her some more...) After pressing second and third statements: Edgeworth: (Two men, one bullet... It's all consistent with what we found out from the body.) Sadly, there wasn't exactly a lot of new information to go on in your testimony... Oldbag: Well, if I saw the guy again, I'm sure I could identify him for you! I mean, how do you expect me to remember anything without something to jog my memory!? Kay: Self-centered, aren't we? Edgeworth: While it was somewhat useful, her testimony also presents us with a new problem... Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: Yes? Kay: So, about this new problem... Edgeworth: What is that giant grin on your face for? Kay: Do you want me to show you something really nice? Edgeworth: ...No, thank you. Kay: Don't be so mean! I swear it's something you're going to like! Edgeworth: What is that gadget you're holding? Kay: What you see before you is the secret weapon of a Great Thief! Edgeworth: ...Ahh, I should have known it would be worthless. Kay: Aww, don't be like that! Tee hee. *ahem!* What do you think now!? Edgeworth: What is it doing...? It's projecting something into the air... Kay: I'm going to input the necessary information to run the simulation now. Once I'm done, I'll increase the size of the projection to its maximum size... Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood! Re-creation Edgeworth: Wh-What is this!? Kay: This is a re-creation of the murder based on the info I inputted into Little Thief! Edgeworth: L-Little Thief? I dare say I think you're taking the Robin Hood thing a bit too far... Kay: Little Thief is actually meant to be a simulator for me to plan my thefts. But I suppose if I used it like this... Let's see... Ms. Oldbag said that the two men were facing each other. And then, a gunshot rang out, and the victim fell to the ground... Edgeworth: Ah... So with this, we can inspect the crime scene as it was in the past. Kay: See! So, what do you think? Edgeworth: I have to say, I'm impressed by the technology thieves have access to these days. Kay: Well, it IS the super-secret weapon of the mighty Yatagarasu! Edgeworth: Indeed. Kay: Oh, but if there isn't enough information, or if something is out of place... ...the re-creation could come out a little strange. Edgeworth: In other words, I can use this to authenticate the validity of a witness's testimony? Kay: You got it! You really catch on quick, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Right now, this simulation is a re-creation of that witness's testimony... So for now, I should re-examine everything... ...and if I find anything illogical or strange, I can then ask for clarification.) Kay: Feel free to examine anything in this simulation in the way you always do! You can even present evidence when you find a contradiction! And if you find something, I've got Little Thief with me, so you just let me know, OK? Begin Investigation Stadium Talk Ema Skye Ema: This is amazing! Just FEEL the power of science! Wendy Oldbag Oldbag: What is this? Some sort of new attraction? Examine Victim Leads to: \"According to the testimony, the victim fell to the ground here...\" Stage Edgeworth: It looks like they broke the stage down (Stage was packed up - The stage I saw this morning in the center of this stadium has been packed away.). Kay: I guess this means they're done for the day... Edgeworth: Or maybe it's because a different show is scheduled to start its run tomorrow. Killer Edgeworth: (It's the silhouette of the killer with his gun at the ready.) Kay, is it not possible to re-create the face of the killer? Kay: Well, I can't exactly input what we don't know into Little Thief. Edgeworth: (She has a point...) Partner Talk Re-creation Edgeworth: So, you believe that this gadget will provide us with the proof we need? Kay: Yeah, of course! Pretty neat, huh? By inputting info like this, it can re-create the crime scene exactly as it was. Although, Little Thief was originally intended to be a training sim for heists... Edgeworth: A training sim for thievery!? I don't believe I can turn a deaf ear to that, Kay. Kay: Bah, it's for practice! Practice! It's not like I've actually stolen anything yet! Besides, we're in the middle of an investigation! So stop nit-picking! Edgeworth: Even if it is just \"practice\", I can't exactly endorse the act of stealing. Although, admittedly, this device is rather useful in an investigation. Using Little Thief (appears after \"Re-creation\") Edgeworth: So, how am I supposed to use this to aid my investigation...? Kay: Oh! That's right! I guess I should explain how to use it, huh? Objects outlined in yellow are things that are not present in our time, but were in the past. Things outlined in a dotted line are things that exist now, but didn't in the past. Edgeworth: I see... Kay: You can examine and interact with replicated people and objects as you normally do. You can even present evidence whenever you find an inconsistency. Oh, and be sure to point out mistakes in the re-creation with evidence, too! Edgeworth: Hmm... Very well, let's continue with the investigation. Kay: If there's something you don't get about Little Thief, feel free to ask anytime, OK? Edgeworth: According to the testimony, the victim fell to the ground here... Kay: That's right. But...? Edgeworth: But, if that's the case, then we've already found our first contradiction. Kay: Huh? What? Where!? Edgeworth: If this is the real scene of the crime, there's something missing that should be here. Which piece of evidence shows the missing item? Present Mr. Deacon's Murder Notes Edgeworth: Leads to: \"This is the contradiction!\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Kay: .................. Maybe you're still adjusting to the simulation...? Edgeworth: ...Y-Yes, that's it. Allow me to find my bearings, and I'll present the contradiction again. (Maybe I need to review the evidence again. It should go without saying that the truth lies in what is missing from this scene!) Leads back to: \"Which piece of evidence shows the missing item?\" Edgeworth: This is the contradiction! Kay: Eh? Is something wrong with my re-creation? Edgeworth: If this is the real scene of the crime, something specific should be here. If you think back, how did we deduce that the other crime scene was not the real one? Kay: Oh! I get what's missing now! There's no blood on the ground here either, right? Edgeworth: Right. The fact that there is no blood here casts doubt on the witness's testimony. Oldbag: Edgey-poooooooo! How can you doubt me like that!? Are you calling me a liar!? I know what I saw! And I saw the victim get shot down! Kay: You know, I don't think she's lying, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: (To be honest, I can't think of a reason why she would lie to me. In that case, maybe there is another explanation for the distinct lack of blood (Why is there no blood? - Why is there no blood around the victim's prone body?).) Examine Victim Edgeworth: (Now I'm fairly convinced that the victim was killed here. But then why is there no blood? There must be some explanation for this contradiction! Perhaps I should go over all of the information I've gathered one more time...) Logic Connect \"Victim was kidnapper?\" and \"Why is there no blood?\" Leads to: \"Is it not possible that the victim was wearing a costume?\" Edgeworth: Is it not possible that the victim was wearing a costume? Kay: So you really think that Mr. Deacon was one of the kidnappers? Edgeworth: I think we can reasonably assume there is a very good chance that he was. And that if he was [sic] shot while he was inside one of those stolen costumes... Kay: ...Then Mr. Deacon's blood would be inside the costume instead of on the ground! Edgeworth: Precisely. Now, if only we could prove that the victim was wearing a costume... Kay: You'd think it'd be pretty easy if we could find some footprints... ...but the problem is FINDING them, since there doesn't seem to be any around. Edgeworth: (Footprints, huh...? I wonder how we can go about finding some of those...?) Talk Ema Skye Footprint analysis Leads to: \"Ema, about that method you were talking about for finding footprints...\" Examine Victim Edgeworth: (Was the victim really wearing a costume? Maybe we can find out if we did some footprint analysis forensics...) Edgeworth: Ema, about that method you were talking about for finding footprints... Ema: Ah, finally my expert knowledge in forensics is needed! Edgeworth: Yes, well... Can you detect and trace even partial footprints? Ema: Leave it to me! My cutting-edge detection kit can find anything! Edgeworth: Very well. If you could please analyze the footprints in this area... Ema: OK! Stand back now, and witness the power of science at work! Ema: Hey! I found something! Look, right here! Edgeworth: ? I don't see anything... Ema: Oh, that's right! Here, put these special glasses on, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ! These footprints here were definitely left by a Badger costume! Ema: Judging by the way the prints are layered, those seem to be the newest. Edgeworth: (Then... we can conclude that the victim was definitely wearing a costume at the time.) Victim's Costume data jotted down in my Organizer. Kay: OK! In that case, I'll update Little Thief's simulation parameters! I can't wait to see what we find out from this new info! Re-creation Investigation Complete Edgeworth: So the victim was wearing a costume when he died. Kay: And with that, we should be one step closer to the truth, right? Edgeworth: (Hmm... I see the re-creation has changed in accordance with the new information.) We may be closer, but now, something else has caught my attention. Oldbag: What do you want? Edgeworth: Your testimony, naturally. I'd like to hear it one more time, if you please. Testimony -- What Oldbag Witnessed -- Oldbag: I came to this stadium to take a short break. As I was resting, I happened to glance over and I saw two men facing each other in that area. Suddenly, there was a loud gunshot, and the person who was shot fell to the ground. It was a very terrifying experience, let me tell you! Kay: So! Does this mean that Ms. Oldbag's testimony has a contradiction in it? Edgeworth: Yes, and I believe our best course of action is to compare it with your re-creation. Kay: See! I just KNEW Little Thief would be of help! Now let's see if we can pull more info from Ms. Oldbag to put into the re-creation! Edgeworth: For that, we must first find the contradiction in her testimony. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean you took a break from being the Pink Badger? Oldbag: You may not think it, but it's hard work keeping kids' dreams alive. You smell of sweat, your hip creaks with pain -- you even begin to dream about work. Kay: That's the kind of story that would scar a child for life, you know... Oldbag: Well, that's why I chose to come take my break here, whippersnapper! I don't plan on playing the part of the Dead Badger in front of a bunch of kids! Edgeworth: So what did you see while you, the Pink Badger, were resting? Oldbag: Oh, yes, that! Well! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You saw two men...? Can you describe them for me? Oldbag: They looked like your average Joes, completely uninteresting and not worth fawning over. I'm telling you, they were so boring that I don't even remember much beyond that. Edgeworth: But did they have any special features? Anything you can recall would be very helpful. Oldbag: Oh, my! Don't tell me you're jealous of those two men! Kay: Hey, she's right. You do seem pretty worked-up over them, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: I-I'm not worked up over anyone! A-And I'm not jealous! Oldbag: It's alright, Edgey-poo. Those two were just foals compared to a stallion like you. I thought so little of them that I lost interest the instant I laid eyes on them. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You're claiming to have seen the exact moment in which the murder took place? Oldbag: Absolutely! That gun made a terrible racket when it was fired. Kay: You didn't try to go help the person that got shot? Oldbag: I'm only one person, you smart-alecky brat! What could I have done!? But I took off as soon as I could to find someone who could help. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: .................. Oldbag: .................. Well, don't you have anything to say to me!? Edgeworth: No, not especially. Oldbag: You're so cold, Edgey-poo. But... that is exactly what I like about you. Kay: You sure are one tough cookie! One part unshakable, and one part scary... Oldbag: Watch that smart mouth of yours, missy! What do you know about my fragile heart!? Edgeworth: Knowing what we know now, thanks to your re-creation... Kay: ...The contradiction stands out like a giant sore thumb! Edgeworth: Precisely. It's all becoming clear to me. Let's clear up this issue with some well-presented evidence, and get this over with.Oldbag: I came to this stadium to take a short break.

Edgeworth: Two men? How did you know the gender of the two people involved... ...seeing as how the victim was wearing a costume at the time!? Oldbag: Ah! Edgeworth: Furthermore, I have another matter I'd like to inquire about! I'd very much like to know... ...why you failed to mention the costume in your testimony!? Oldbag: Uwah! Edgeworth: I'm beginning to doubt if you really witnessed the murder at all. Oldbag: But I'm telling you, I really did see it! I saw it with my very own eyes! .........From a seat in the second tier. Edgeworth: The second tier...? Kay: Hey, didn't you say you saw it \"right in front of you\" earlier? Oldbag: That was... you know... I was using the phrase in the metaphorical sense...? Edgeworth: (*sigh* I see our witness still has a screw loose, in the metaphorical sense.) Oldbag: The cushy seats in the second tier are reserved for hot-shot VIPs. Which is exactly why I go there now and again to take a nap! Kay: I can't see how you could've gotten a good look from there. It's so high up! Edgeworth: Were you able to see even the victim's costume from way up there? Oldbag: Well, I know I saw two people. But I couldn't really see what they looked like because they were in the stage's shadow (In the shadow of the stage - It was hard to make out the killer and victim that Oldbag saw in the stage's shadow.). My eyesight isn't what it used to be, you know. Not like when I was young. Ah, people used to call me \"Eagle-Eyed Wendy\" back then! could spot a good man from 100 paces away as I walked down the street, just like that! Of course, they also noticed me in a flash and tried to make their move. But I'm not that easy! I was a careful girl with a judgmental eye! But I never let a good man slip me by, you bet I didn't! If you could've seen Edgeworth: *sigh* Let's return to our investigation, shall we, Kay? Kay: You got it! Begin Investigation Stadium Talk Ema Skye Footprint analysis Edgeworth: Thanks to you, I'm able to proceed with my investigation once again. Thank you. Ema: Ah, it was nothing! I'm just glad that science and I could be of service! Kay: Pretty amazing how we could see the footprints. So what's the secret behind that thing? Ema: Oh, you want to know? Um... here, you can read the manual! Kay: Aha... Very interesting... So if I do this, I can avoid leaving footprints... Edgeworth: (She can't seriously be trying to use the information to her advantage as a thief... Wait...) Examine Victim Edgeworth: (This new silhouette of the victim is in a costume.) Kay: The silhouettes can change depending on the information I input. But Little Thief can re-create more than just people... So investigate away! We may even find more info with which to make a more accurate sim! Edgeworth: Alright. Sounds like a plan. Logic Connect \"Stage was packed up\" and \"In the shadow of the stage\" Leads to: \"If that woman's testimony is to be believed...\" Edgeworth: If that woman's testimony is to be believed... ...the murder occurred before the stage was broken down. Kay: Do you want me to input that bit of info into Little Thief? Edgeworth: Yes, if you please. Kay: OK! Re-creation Examine Killer Leads to: \"There is clearly...\" Sign Edgeworth: \"Battle of the Magicians: Max Galactica versus Troupe Gramarye\"... And tomorrow, there will be a concert by the \"hip\" new rock band, the Gavinners. Not that either of these stage shows interest me in the least. Bottom side of stage Kay: Hey, there's a mic up there! What kind of ninja is the Jammin' Ninja? He's no slouch, no way, you betcha!♪ You're the best, Jammin' Ninja! Everyone's always trying to thank ya!♪ How was that? Edgeworth: How was what? Kay: You know what would be really awesome? If we put a band together! I can see it now! A Great Thief and a Prosecutor, stealing the hearts of millions around the world! Edgeworth: The only instruments I can play are the flute and the piano... Kay: You can play the flute while playing the piano!? That's really fresh! Edgeworth: How many hands do (changed from [to] in the original release, correcting the typo) you think I have!? Besides, I haven't even agreed to anything yet! Edgeworth: There is clearly... Kay: ...A contradiction here! Edgeworth: Please stop stealing my lines! Kay: Oh, come on. It wasn't that hard to see it coming, even for a layman like me! Edgeworth: I suppose. In any case, it's not possible for the killer to have stood here in that way... ...because there was a very real stage set up in this spot at that time. Kay: Yeesh, I told you I got it! Do you feel the need to explain everything!? Edgeworth: Yes, well... In any case, we still need to resolve this unusual situation. Kay: Isn't it obvious? The killer was on top of the stage, naturally. Right, Ms. Oldbag!? Oldbag: Yes! I remember now! The killer was standing on top of the stage! Kay: See! Now let me update the info in the simulation. Re-creation Investigation Complete Lang: Well, well, what have we here? A bunch of hooligans running amok, I see! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, how nice of you to join us. Lang: Well, I can't have you going around messing up my crime scenes. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, we've discovered that the real scene of the murder is here, the stadium. Lang: I see. Thanks. Edgeworth: For what? Lang: I'm just trying to show you my appreciation for all the time you saved me. Who knew that such a strange little toy could re-create a crime scene like that. Kay: Little Thief is NOT a toy! Lang: ...You two! Sir! Lang: And there you have it. You see? Big boys like me don't need silly toys, little girl. Kay: *sigh* Lang: Now THIS is a re-creation. Edgeworth: So what? Do you still intend to assert that Officer Meekins is the killer? Lang: Of course. Even knowing that the crime took place here doesn't let him off the hook. Argument -- Agent Lang's Logic -- Lang: This is the real scene of the crime. Officer Meekins lay in wait for the victim on top of the stage. And when the victim finally showed, he shot him from on high! That's the truth your little re-creation showed. Edgeworth: How far will you go to accuse Officer Meekins of the crime...? Lang: He's the most likely suspect we've got, especially given the situation with his gun. Kay: Well, even if he is the killer, at least my re-creation was on the mark. Lang: You see? Thank you for understanding, my little crow-girl. Kay: Grr... I'm not some common crow! I'm the Yatagarasu! The raven of legend! Edgeworth: Unfortunately, your conclusion has yet to be tested, so let's see how well it holds up. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Looks like we found the real crime scene first. Lang: Ha! Brag all you want, but we don't have all that free time, unlike the two of you. Kay: Heh heh. You know what you remind me of? A dog licking his wounds as he whimpers home! Lang: Well, I guess I should be thankful for all the time you saved me. Xie xie. That's how we say \"thanks\" in my country. Edgeworth: Y-You're welcome. (I hope he realizes we didn't do all of this for him...) Lang: But I'm here now, so I'll be taking over! As I was saying, this is where the crime took place. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Lying in wait? How did Officer Meekins even know the victim was going to come here? Lang: Simple. He was investigating the kidnappers, right? And while he was doing so, he came to understand the victim, Mr. Deacon's movements. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hah! And why would the good officer want to ambush and kill a kidnapper? Lang: Lang: You mean his motive? Who knows, and who cares. You can find that out for yourself when you talk to him in jail. Edgeworth: Hmph. You have no respect for the order of law. Lang: Don't get me wrong, but I need more than \"There's no motive!\" to convince me otherwise. Edgeworth: (He's right. The lack of a motive is a rather weak argument by itself.) Lang: So, the officer lay in wait on top of the stage... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you agree with how our re-creation turned out...? Lang: Like I said, I'm grateful that you were able to save me some time. Edgeworth: Alright, but we still don't know why he chose to wait on top of the stage. Lang: Who cares. Maybe he wanted to become the Blue Badger. Who's to say he didn't see the stage and decided to put on a Badger stage show of his own? Edgeworth: (Or maybe there's a completely different reason...?) Lang: What does it matter!? It still doesn't change the fact that Officer Meekins... ...stood up on that stage and shot the victim on the ground below. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you honestly believe that what you're saying is what really occurred? Lang: Hey, you're the ones who came up with this scenario. Are you saying you doubt yourselves? Edgeworth: Nnngh... Touché... Edgeworth: Unfortunately, Agent Lang's conclusions do not contradict with our re-creation. Kay: Hmm... Then, does that mean it all went down just as he says? Edgeworth: No, not quite. (I wonder if what we had re-created earlier was the whole truth?)Lang: This is the real scene of the crime. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Looks like we found the real crime scene first. Lang: Ha! Brag all you want, but we don't have all that free time, unlike the two of you. Kay: Heh heh.

Present Mr. Deacon's Murder Notes Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I'm terribly sorry, Agent Lang.\" Lang: That's the truth your little re-creation showed. Press Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you honestly believe that what you're saying is what really occurred? Lang: Hey, you're the ones who came up with this scenario. Are you saying you doubt yourselves? Edgeworth: Nnngh... Touché... Edgeworth: Unfortunately, Agent Lang's conclusions do not contradict with our re-creation. Kay: Hmm... Then, does that mean it all went down just as he says? Edgeworth: No, not quite. (I wonder if what we had re-created earlier was the whole truth?) Edgeworth: I'm terribly sorry, Agent Lang. Lang: ? Edgeworth: I should have you warned you that our re-creation is incomplete. You cut in quite unexpectedly, after all. Lang: What's that supposed to mean? Edgeworth: You said that the victim was shot by the killer from up above, correct? I hate to break it to you, but that's not possible. Kay: Huh? Why not? Edgeworth: Recall Mr. Deacon's body, specifically, where the gunshot wounds were located. Kay: .................. Actually, I didn't get that good of a look. Edgeworth: Oh. Well then. The bullet entered Mr. Deacon in his abdominal region, and exited his right shoulder. This is more consistent with an angled shot from beneath the victim. Lang: Kngh! Kay: Then...! Edgeworth: Yes, our re-creation had the victim being shot at an angle from above. Kay: A clear contradiction! Lang: You're discounting your own conclusions!? Edgeworth: No, this one point is the only flaw. This was the mistaken parameter in our re-creation: The stage's location Edgeworth: That's right. The location of the stage was wrong. Kay: You mean the stage was in a totally different spot than where it is now? Edgeworth: Yes, the stage was situated where the victim was standing in our simulation. Lang: Hah! Are you out of your mind, Mr. Prosecutor!? I've never heard of a stage show where the stage actually blocks the audience's view! Edgeworth: I-I suppose not... But I swear I know the reason for the error! Leads back to: \"This was the mistaken parameter in our re-creation:\" The witness's location Edgeworth: The location of the witness was our mistake. Oldbag: Edgey-poo! How can you betray me like this!? Edgeworth: Your testimony was riddled with vague statements. Lang: Hey, now. I can't let you get away with bad-mouthing a very valuable witness! Besides, if you're saying that it was wrong for you to think she saw it from far away... ...then, perhaps she saw it from up close? That'd make her story even more trustworthy. Edgeworth: I-I didn't mean it that way... Oldbag: Edgey-poo! You can do it! Hang in there! Edgeworth: (So the wrong parameter was not where the witness was... In that case...!) Leads back to: \"This was the mistaken parameter in our re-creation:\" The killer's & victim's locations Leads to: \"Yes, the locations of the killer and the victim were wrong.\" Edgeworth: Yes, the locations of the killer and the victim were wrong. Lang: Ah, I get it. I see what you're trying to say! Edgeworth: I believe the killer and the victim were standing opposite to what we initially thought. It was the victim who was on top of the stage as he was being shot by the killer! Re-creation Edgeworth: If this is [sic] what happened, it'd also explain the positioning of the gunshot wounds. Kay: But then, what about the footprints? Edgeworth: Since footprints don't lie, we can assume then, that the killer also wore a costume. Kay: OK! I'll try using that data instead! Re-creation Edgeworth: Judging by the fact that both the killer and the victim were wearing costumes... ...I'd say it was a killing between the two kidnappers. That would be the most natural conclusion. Wouldn't you agree, Agent Lang? Lang: Hmph. Well done, Mr. Prosecutor! But that alone doesn't clear Officer Meekins of the crime! Argument -- Another Bit of Proof -- Lang: I ask that you take another good look at the tire marks over there. The three marks are indicative of the Blue Badgermobile. That story Officer Meekins told about that shop on wheels getting stolen was just a lie. He drove the Blue Badgermobile here and committed the murder. Then, he used the car to move the body to the garage in the Wild, Wild West Area. Edgeworth: You believe he moved the body with the car? Lang: That's right. It was Officer Meekins himself who pointed us to the way he did it. Edgeworth: (The three-tired tread marks are very telling, however... ...is the Blue Badgermobile the only thing capable of creating such a pattern?) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The tire marks...? Lang: Yes, the tire marks. The ones there behind the stage. They were hidden up until now by the various pieces of stage equipment. As for when they were made... Edgeworth: ...They must have been made after the rain had begun to fall, correct? Lang: Yes, and probably around the same time as when the killer's footprints were made. The tires on that Blue Badgermobile probably got pretty muddy because of that. I say it's the Blue Badgermobile because, well, that's pretty obvious, too. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Three tire marks... I have to agree that the Blue Badgermobile has three tires. Lang: Of course! The only thing in this park that could make those marks is that roving shop. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you forgetting that there are, in fact, three of them? You can't simply ignore the Pink and the Proto Badgermobiles, Agent Lang. Lang: Lang: Of course. I didn't say it couldn't be either of the other two... ...but I see no reason to drag them into this just to complicate things! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Of course, you have some sort of proof that it was all a lie, correct? Lang: Of course not. Kay: Well, that was blunt. Lang: But, suppose it is a lie. It would explain a lot of things. Like his movements and his whereabouts. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you still claim that the tire marks belonged to the Blue Badgermobile? Lang: It must have arrived on the scene after the ground had become wet with rain. Officer Meekins committed the murder. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Besides the Blue Badgermobile, there are other ways the body could've been moved. Lang: Lang: Recall what the Wild, Wild West Area looked like. Only the Blue Badgermobile and Mr. Deacon's body were in the garage. I'd say that's proof. Edgeworth: (I suppose if one were to look at that place, that would be the only logical conclusion. However, my experience tells me that the truth is usually not so easily found. Is there some sort of problem with Agent Lang's statement with regard to that scene?) Kay: Looks like the only thing that car was selling was death, not dreams. Edgeworth: Only if what Agent Lang believes turns out to be true. (The three-tired tread marks are very telling, however... ...is the Blue Badgermobile the only thing capable of creating such a pattern?)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Dick Gumshoe\nDescription: Homicide detective at the local precinct.

    "cot": "Among the testimonies by Lang (Testimony 2, 3, and 4), he claims that Officer Meekins drove the Blue Badgermobile to commit the murder and then used it to move the body to the garage. However, the evidence (Evidence 8 - Blue Badgermobile) states that the Blue Badgermobile was parked inside the garage the whole time, and there was no mud found on its tires. This contradicts the testimony because if the vehicle was parked the entire time and had no mud on its tires, it could not have driven out and moved the body as Lang claims.\n",
